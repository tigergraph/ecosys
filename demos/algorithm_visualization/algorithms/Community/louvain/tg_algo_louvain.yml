    name: Louvain Modularity

    description: The Louvain Method for community detection partitions the vertices in a graph by approximately maximizing the graph’s modularity score. The modularity score for a partitioned graph assesses the difference in density of links within a partition vs. the density of links crossing from one partition to another. If a partitioning is good, then the within-density should be high and the inter-density should be low.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm can optionally write the ID (INT) of the community that each vertex belongs to, if the vertex has an INT attribute. This algorithm also uses a FLOAT value on the target edges (representing weight or influence) to help calculate modularity.
