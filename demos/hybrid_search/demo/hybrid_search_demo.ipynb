''\\\\nRegarding the song 's meaning , O'Brien told The Sun it , `` is a sort of ode to meaninglessness , that absolute void that we all feel at some stage in our lives , if not every single day .\\\\nIt sort of proposes that this void is the very thing that binds us all together as human beings on this planet . ''\\\\nO'Brien described this song to The Sun , as a `` tragi-comedy .

''\\\\n-LRB- Both song titles taken from a recurring line in the book used every time a death occurs -RRB- Also English alternative rock band Billy Pilgrim took their name from the novel 's soldier protagonist .\\\\nThis was the only song on -LRB- Awayland -RRB- that was written by O'Brien in one session .\\\\nHe explained to WhiteTapes : `` I literally woke up and it was in my head .\\\\nLike a Paul McCartney moment .\\\\nThis never happened to me before or after .\\\\nI just sang it to my computer and recorded so that was a quick song .\\\\nThe others were very long and slow and just , really teasing .

      " Description: This empowerment anthem is the title track to Sugarland 's fourth studio album .\\nIn our 2010 interview with Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland , she told us : `` I love the way the song came about musically .\\nIt hovered around for a couple of days in that I had that little piano part .\\nI was playing around with that at home , and Kristian -LRB- Bush -RRB- and I came into the writing studio and we wrote part of the lyrics , the ` feels like I 'm flying , wings made of light , ' separately .\\nWe thought it was going to be a different song .\\nWe had n't put anything together yet .\\nWe thought that was actually going to be the chorus of another song .\\nAnd then we were also listening to some drums , some rhythm grooves at the time , and he started playing a guitar part .\\nI said , ` Wait a minute .\\nLet me go sit down at the piano here . '\\nAnd it all came together , the cogs and the wheels just all started moving and aligning , and suddenly we were like , ` Oh , wait a minute .\\nNo , we 're going to make this be reverse , ' and the whole song just really unfolded in this really beautiful discovery .\\nIt was a discovery for us , as well .\\nIt 's always really special when a song reveals itself in that way , where it goes to a refreshing discovery .\\nSome of them you punch and kick and all of that , and some of them really reveal themselves , and ` Incredible Machine ' definitely felt that way .\\nAnd I love the metaphor , because it speaks to the human heart and the incredible machine that it is , and its exquisite capacity to love and to feel and to understand . ''\\nThe Incredible Machine is inspired by some of the artists Kristen Bush and Jennifer Nettles listened to in their teen years such as Blondie , Peter Gabriel , R.E.M. and The Clash .\\nNettles told The Boot that in recording The Incredible Machine the pair wanted , `` to explore new territory and allow the genre to grow because , as we all know , if we do n't grow we stagnate .\\n`` Nettles added that the line , `` Feels like I 'm flying , wings made of light/brand new and shinin ' , like a shot rung out through the night , '' best sums up the bands rebirth .\\nShe explained : `` That 's a wonderful metaphor and image for this newly emerging creature that Sugarland is right now , with these vulnerable but beautiful wings .\\nThe Incredible Machine is definitely us , but at the same time , there is something very precious and new .

      " Description: This song finds Rock exploring how despite his fame , he still experiences loneliness .\\n`` I just pictured myself having an honest conversation in the mirror ... you know , Bob Richie talking to Kid Rock .\\nBut it 's not , you know , ` Oh , I 'm so successful and I feel alone , '' he told MTV News .\\nLong-term studio cohort and co-engineer Al Sutton told Detroit Free Press : `` There was a specific vibe on this , and we spent a lot of time to get the right take .\\nThe next day -LRB- Kid Rock -RRB- comes and decides to take the drums out of the first half .\\nIt was kind of funny - we 'd spent so much time on it .\\nBut his instinct was right on .
