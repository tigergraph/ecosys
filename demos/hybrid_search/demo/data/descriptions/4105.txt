This bonus track from Fall Out Boy vocalist Patrick Stump 's debut solo album was inspired by Conan O'Brien on his last episode of The Tonight Show .
Stump explained to Spin magazine : '' -LSB- Conan O'Brien -RSB- spoke to how cynical our generation is and how unfortunate that is .
That 's what ` Mad at Nothing ' is about .
I feel very strongly that we need to be a bit positive .
It 's too bad that people relate to each other with sarcasm and misery - but that 's what we know .
`` Stump added that the Truant Wave track `` Love , Selfish Love '' explores the same theme .
