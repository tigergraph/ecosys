This song is about a guy who is far away from a girl he loved .
Part of him wants to visit her wherever she is but the other part of him does n't want to go because he feels like he would be getting in the way of her time with other guys and all of her one night stands .
Even though he loves her , his love for her was n't enough - she wanted something more .
When she wakes up tomorrow with a massive hangover , he does n't want her to call him .
Tonight he is going to go out with his guy friends to try to get her off of his mind .
No matter what he does he ca n't get his mind off of her so he decides to call her and the results are n't good .
-LRB- thanks , Lisa - Palatine , IL -RRB- The title is a play on the phrase `` Halcyon Days , '' meaning the good times .
A halcyon is a fabled bird that was said to calm the wind and seas .
