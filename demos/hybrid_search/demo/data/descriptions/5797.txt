This song is from Obscured By Clouds , one of a few soundtracks Pink Floyd produced early in their career to rid themselves of pressure on their artistic expression .
The album was made for a movie called La Vallee , also known as The Valley -LRB- Obscured by Clouds -RRB- .
Pink Floyd also produced a soundtrack for the film More .
Barbet Schroeder directed both films .
-LRB- thanks , Joel - Chicago , IL -RRB- The title itself is not in the lyrics , but it 's said at the very beginning when the band counts `` one , two , free , four , '' a play on words .
-LRB- thanks , Jim - Oxnard , CA -RRB- The lyrics are rather depressing , but the song is very upbeat -LRB- including Roger Waters gleefully uttering a line about the angel of death -RRB- .
It 's about how our lives pass by - most of the time with no real effect on the cycle by which we all live and pass .
-LRB- thanks , Matt - Russell Springs , KY , for above 2 -RRB-
