This song was inspired by the daughter of Herod who in the Gospels , demanded John The Baptist 's head on a platter .
Doherty explained to The Sun March 13 , 2009 : `` She came dancing out of the dawn , a half-woken dream , straight out of the fireplace just when you thought the ashes were dead .
She demands ` the head of any bastard . '
Isadora Duncan -LRB- iconic dancer -RRB- had to get in there .
Do you know how she died ?
Her scarf got caught in the wheel of a carriage and decapitated her .
Horrendous .
I wanted to get Christine Keeler -LRB- the spy scandal showgirl -RRB- in there too , just because I wanted to rhyme her with tequila . ''
Doherty admitted to the NME February 16 , 2010 that he inadvertently stole the tune from Babyshambles guitarist Mik Whitnall .
The song is only credited to him because `` it just slipped my mind '' that Whitnall had a helping hand in it .
This song had been part of the Doherty solo cannon for a number of years before he recorded it .
He commented to the NME March 21,2009 : `` people call this old .
The second Libs album was full of songs that should have been on the first , but we did n't have time .
Everyone 's acting like I 'm churning out old ideas . ''
