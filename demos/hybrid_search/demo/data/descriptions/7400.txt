This was the first single released by Big & Rich following a hiatus in which Big Kenny recovered from a neck injury and John Rich released a solo debut album .
The song made history when it debuted at # 24 on the Billboard Country chart as it became the highest debut by a duo in the Nielsen BDS era .
It overtook Sugarland 's `` All I Want To Do , '' which opened at # 27 on the tally dated June 7 , 2008 .
This is the only song on Hillbilly Jedi that neither Big Kenny or John Rich contributed to the writing .
The duo rarely cut outside songs and Rich told The Boot why they felt compelled to record this one .
`` That song is what country songs are supposed to be about , '' he said .
`` You ca n't say it any better than that song .
I wish we could 've written it , but it 's OK that we did n't .
Two or three years ago , I bought Willie Nelson 's box set , which probably had 200 songs on it .
I started looking at all the credits , assuming Willie wrote everything he ever sang .
But he did n't write ` You were Always On My Mind . '
and actually a bunch of other stuff .
Same with Johnny Cash , Waylon -LSB- Jennings -RSB- ... So it dawned on me one day that you do n't have to write everything you sing to be a true artist .
When you come across a song like ` That 's Why I Pray , ' it 's so special that you need to cut it .
I do n't care if zoo animals wrote it !
You record it because it 's such a powerful , special song . ''
Songwriting credits go to Danelle Leverett , Blair Daly and Sarah Buxton.Texan native Danelle Leverett is one half of the country duo The JaneDear Girls , whose debut single , `` Wildflower '' was a hit in 2011 .
John Rich produced their entire debut album.Nashville-based songwriter Blair Daly has had hit singles on many different formats including Country , Top 40 and AC .
They include Rascal Flatts ' `` Stand and '' Uncle Kracker 's `` Smile .
`` American Country singer-songwriter Sarah Buxton released her self-titled debut album in early 2010 , which included the hit single `` Outside My Window . ''
She has also co-written several songs for Keith Urban , including his 2010 single , `` Put You In A Song . ''
