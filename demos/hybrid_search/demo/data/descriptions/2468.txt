Frontman Alex Turner recalled the writing of this song to NME : `` I watched a couple of westerns when we were doing this , like Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid , which gets a reference in there .
I also just wanted to put ` belly-button piercings ' in a tune , I thought that would be good .
I 'd kind of wanted to do it for a couple of weeks and then managed to fit it in there .
Why ?
I 'd not thought about them for a while and they came on my radar somehow .
And then I thought about this thing of them and the stars being juxtaposed . ''
Turner told NME why he wrote this as a deliberately opaque almost nonsense poem : `` Something I 've discovered as I 've gone on is that it 's cool to let the words sometimes take more of a back seat .
I think there 's like two types of songs -LRB- that I write -RRB- where some of them I want people to , like , understand where it is and almost be right there with you .
So that would be something like ` Cornerstone ' , where I feel the person listening is right there with you .
Then there 's other things that are more like ` Black Treacle ' or ` Crying Lightning ' from the last one , where it 's much more vague , and I want to keep it that way.I always think of some Bowie tunes that do that , things like ` Five Years ' you 're right there with him , and other things like that tune ` Lady Grinning Soul ' , it 's sort of describing this woman , obviously , but you do n't know where you are with it . ''
Q magazine asked Turner if such lyrics as `` When you chew your chin , am I ruining your fun '' refers to cocaine ?
He replied : `` It 's a bit of a funny one !
It 's whatever you want it to be . ''
