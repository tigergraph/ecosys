The Little Big Town quartet share co-writing credits with Lori McKenna on this yearning Country ballad .
`` I love that this lyric is so brutally honest , '' said Karen Fairchild .
`` There are times in a relationship when you allow things to come between you , so much so that it feels like an incredibly long way back to each other .
It 's a lonely place to be especially when you 're lying right next to someone you love . ''
The song 's music video was shot in April 2013 by Becky Fluke -LRB- Pistol Annies/The Civil Wars -RRB- .
The clip takes place at the historic Tennessee Theater and The Oliver Hotel in Knoxville , Tennessee and captures a look into one night , highlighting the tension and honesty in the song 's lyrics .
The song is sung as a duet between married band members Karen Fairchild and Jimi Westbrook .
The song was n't written or intended as a duet .
`` When we wrote this song with Lori McKenna , we did n't know it was going to be a duet .
We wrote it from one person 's perspective , '' Fairchild told CMT .
`` It was on accident that it became a duet . ''
She continued : `` Clearly , Jimi and I live together , so when we were brainstorming on what should go on the record and what should n't , we were going through that song .
There were just the two of us in the kitchen and we were like , ` Man , that makes a cool duet ! ' ''
