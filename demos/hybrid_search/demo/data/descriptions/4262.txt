The title track of Fantasia 's fourth studio album finds the American Idol alumna facing her demons and surviving .
The song was penned by Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sandé and was part inspired by Fantasia 's difficult 2010 , during which she was hospitalized following an overdose and aborted a child arising from a relationship with a married man .
`` She actually wrote the song for me and sent the song in , '' the singer explained to MTV News.Fantasia added that her team was initially sceptical to play Sandé 's demo to her .
`` I think they felt like maybe the song is very deep and it 's actually a testimony of mine and it 's actually something that I went through that is n't a secret .
It 's very public .
And I said ` You know what ?
I thank her for this song cause the song is able to tell everybody who has questions or who wants to know what happened ... you can hear it in that song . ' ''
The Side Effects of You album debuted at # 2 on the Billboard 200 , the highest chart slot to date for Fantasia .
