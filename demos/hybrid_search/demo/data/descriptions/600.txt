This was the follow-up to The Ronettes hugely successful debut single `` Be My Baby . ''
Like `` Be My Baby , '' this was written by Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich , and produced by Phil Spector using his famous `` Wall Of Sound '' technique .
Unfortunately , the song was released not long after the assassination of US president John F. Kennedy , which put a damper on sales of upbeat singles .
The Ronettes were never able to match the success of `` Be My Baby , '' although they were influential enough to gain induction to the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame .
Twice , covers of this song have peaked at # 8 in the UK chart , bettering The Ronettes ' version .
In 1973 Welsh singer/guitarist Dave Edmunds recorded this as a homage to Phil Spector and in 1980 American rock group The Ramones had their only UK Top 20 hit with their cover , which was produced by Spector .
In the US , Canadian singer-songwriter Andy Kim reached # 9 in 1969 with his version .
In Canada the record did well enough to earn Kim a Juno Award as his country 's Top Male Vocalist .
Cher sang backup on The Ronettes version , and later recorded it on her own in a much slower , more dramatic style .
Her version was produced by Phil Spector , and was released as the B-side of `` A Woman 's Story , '' which was Spector 's first production for Warner-Spector Records , his collaboration with Warner Brothers .
