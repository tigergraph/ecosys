Faith Hill 's first single from her seventh studio album was penned by Ryan Tedder about a soldier friend of his who was serving overseas .
Hill debuted the song on the CMA Awards on November 9 , 2011 and it was made available for download shortly afterwards .
It was the Country artist 's first single since `` Red Umbrella '' was released over four years previously .
The song was originally a power-ballad from Tedder 's pop/rock band , OneRepublic 's debut album , Dreaming Out Loud .
Speaking about her single , Hill said , `` It 's such a great song , so well written - a beautiful lyric and sentiment - combined with a driving musical undertone and instrumentation .
