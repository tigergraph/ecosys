This Tony Martin , Neil Thrasher and Wendell Mobley written cut captures the feeling of isolation Aldean felt when he moved from his home town of Macon , Georgia , leaving behind friends and loved ones .
`` To me , the appeal to that song was me moving to Nashville , moving away from all my friends , starting my new life , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` I 'd call home , and all those guys would be hanging out , and I 'd be sitting in my apartment by myself , writing songs and doing my thing .
This was a song that took me back to that period in my life , remembering that feeling of ' I wish I was there with ya 'll , have fun , drink one for me . '
That kind of summed it up . ''
Night Train has a common thread running through it of taking stock of life in adulthood , after the adventures we all got up to in our teenage years .
`` Everybody does that when you get to be a certain age , '' Aldean told Billboard magazine .
`` You 're not a kid anymore , you 're not an old man , you 're caught in the middle , and that 's where I am .
If we sit around and talk , I do n't know one person my age that wo n't bring up , ` Man , when we were in high school we did this one night and got caught , ' or ' I met this girl . '
It 's fun for people to reminisce about good times and things you should have got arrested for . ''
