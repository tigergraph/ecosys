This is a track from Truant Wave , the debut solo studio EP by Fall Out Boy singer Patrick Stump .
The song follows the recurring theme of the CD that the singer 's generation is too cynical and does n't know how to relate to each other .
He explained to Spin magazine : `` You know , a lot of people ask me why I do n't have a Twitter .
It 's sad that people really go out of their way to tell everyone everything about themselves .
Our country has verbal diarrhea .
It 's really sad - there 's no mystery , no surprise .
` Love Selfish Love ' is just about that .
It would be nice to go on a first date with somebody and not be able to know everything about them from their MySpace or Facebook profile .
There 's no first impressions anymore .
You go to a job interview and they 'll probably Google you .
It 's a shame - people should play it a little closer to the chest as far as what information they release to the world .
If I 'm angry about something I 'm not going to take to my Twitter .
The whole record explores that idea . ''
