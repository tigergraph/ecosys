LeAnn Rimes on Great American Country : `` I think this is every woman 's theme song .
No matter what crap goes on , all you need is a good friend and a glass of wine .
That 's what we do and it 's great .
One of my very best girlfriends and her husband and Dean and myself , we sit down with a glass of wine at the end of the day and hash it out .
That 's what this song is about .
It really is about my life . ''
LeAnn Rimes told AOL about the origins of this song : `` I remember writing down the title in my journal several years ago on a plane ride .
I was having a tough time being away from home , and I thought a good friend and a glass of wine could solve many of my problems .
I carried the title around for a long while until it found a home and became what it is today . ''
