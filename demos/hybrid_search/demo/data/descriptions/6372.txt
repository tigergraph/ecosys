Rachael Yamagata 's third album , Chesapeake , finds the American singer-songwriter lightening up after the intensity of her sophomore release , Elephants ... Teeth Sinking Into Heart .
She told Magnet magazine : `` So many ways .
I 've lightened up a little bit .
I discovered how to let go , especially in the studio .
Elephants was so precious ; every song was strategically arranged and intellectual on the production side .
This record is more fly by seat of pants , no preconceived template of what I was going to record or how to do it .
I left it up to being spontaneous .
We ran through the songs before we recorded them , then played 'em live .
There 's more of an ease to this one .
It 's very in the moment.Lyrically , I figured to how to have depth without concentrating on sorrow .
I realized I do n't have to focus on the heartache .
I have some almost-positive songs .
That 's a new thing for me .
` Saturday Morning ' has a lighthearted vibe .
It 's a positive song but hints at the challenges of a relationship .
I find it hard to write positively , but I think I 'm figuring out a bridge for myself . ''
