This was released as the third single from Wiz Khalifa 's fourth studio album O.N.I.F.C. Khalifa wrote the track himself with Sony artist Jonathan Atangana .
The beat was supplied by ID Labs , a Pittsburgh production duo consisting of E. Dan and Big Jerm .
Their previous credits included Mac Miller 's `` Frick Park Market , '' as well as Wiz 's own `` The Race . ''
Singer-songwriter and producer Akon sings the hook in which he criticises rappers who fake their persona .
`` You know we can see through the blinds homie , '' he croons .
`` See through the truth and them lies homie . ''
