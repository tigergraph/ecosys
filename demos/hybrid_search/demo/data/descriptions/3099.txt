Lead singer Jason Wade said : `` Before my girlfriend and I got together , she had broken up with this guy .
I 'd been head-over-heels for her for years even though she was dating him .
So they broke up , and I was like , `` Man , if I do n't make a move now , I may never get a chance . ''
I was always friends with her but never really could get a step further .
So I started taking her out to dinners and stuff .
She was a little bit on the rebound , but I think she had some feelings for me .
We were at that point where we were n't sure if we were dating or not , or even if she really liked me in that way .
It was a very vulnerable time for me and that 's when I wrote `` Somewhere In Between . ''
I poured all those feelings into the song .
Then I played it for her and that was it , we were together . ''
