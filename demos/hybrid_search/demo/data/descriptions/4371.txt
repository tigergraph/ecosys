Michele told Billboard magazine that she named her sophomore album after this Ne-Yo penned track as a result of having a realization about relationships .
Michele was referring to the relationship with her former manager , Douglas `` Biggs '' Ellison , who Michele sued for embezzlement and harassment in 2008 .
She explained : `` I heard the song that Ne-Yo had written titled ` Epiphany , ' and the word just stood out to me .
It stood out to me because I 'd been through a lot in my last relationship , and the word ` epiphany ' exemplified exactly what happened in the end when I realized I did n't have to put myself through it anymore . ''
The album debuted at # 1 on the US Billboard charts .
However the week-ending sale total of 83,000 copies was the lowest for a # 1-entering album since tracking firm Nielsen Soundscan 's started keeping records in 1991 .
A few months later , the Country duo Sugarland clocked up a new low when their Wal-Mart exclusive CD/DVD package Live on the Inside debuted at # 1 with 76,000 sales .
