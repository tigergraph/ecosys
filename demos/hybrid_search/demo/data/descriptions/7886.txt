This punk fuelled track was released as the first single , along with `` Absolute Zero , '' from Stone Sour 's fourth album , House Of Gold And Bones : Part 1 .
The LP is the first part of a double concept set , and frontman Corey Taylor told Metal Shrine that he had the idea to put together a record revolving around one theme for a while .
`` I 've had the idea for the concept for a few years actually , but I 've never given myself the time to really flesh it out and see it clearly , '' he said .
`` It was right about the time when we did the Sonisphere shows that for some reason `` Boom !
it & hit me !
I saw it as clear as day , beginning , middle and end .
I knew the characters , I knew the world that I wanted to create , I knew what I wanted to do . ''
Stone Sour tapped Rachel Bolan of Skid Row to play bass on House Of Gold And Bones .
Taylor told The Pulse of Radio how that came together .
`` I 'm well-documented being a huge Skid Row fan , '' he said .
`` I ca n't remember who brought the name up , but I immediately was like , ' Dude , absolutely . '
We knew somebody who had his number , so I called him and within 24 hours he was basically getting ready to do it .
And he 's just one of the coolest dudes on the planet and he schooled it .
People are going to be very impressed by the bass playing . ''
Speaking with Rolling Stone , Taylor said that though each track has its own identity , there is still a narrative spine .
`` Each song tells a different part of the story , but it 's so unique unto itself , '' he said .
`` That was one of the things we really wanted to go for ; we did n't want to do a batch of tunes that that all sound alike .
We wanted to make sure each song had its own soul , basically . ''
