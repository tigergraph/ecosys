This song is about a woman who has apparently married a very well to do man .
She may be , to him at least , a trophy wife , and he has set her a up in a mansion on a hill with a fence around it to protect her from the world .
There is a certain melancholy to the song , and we are given to believe that the mansion is very much a prison to her , but rather than lose the privilege and prestige inherent in her marriage , she chooses to remain in that prison .
