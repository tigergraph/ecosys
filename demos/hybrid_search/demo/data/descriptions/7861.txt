DeRülo travelled the world after the success of this debut album .
In doing so he experienced different places and discovered new things , which influenced the writing of his sophomore record , Future History .
He told Digital Spy : `` There 's a song on album called ` Breathing ' where a lot of influences took part : African chants , Euro-dance , rock guitar and bits that you ca n't even hear on the finished version . ''
He continued : `` That song means a lot to me as it 's serious and heartfelt , but the melody is the exact opposite .
It 's about my cousin , who recently passed away . ''
DeRulo told the Associated Press 's Mesfin Fekadu why he made such an uptempo song about his cousin 's death .
He explained : `` It 's partly about my cousin 's passing and partly about a relationship I was in .
It has a positive-negative vibe to it .
If you 're going through something you do n't have to dwell in it .
You can pick yourself up and that was the thought process behind writing this song and during the recording process , during the writing process it was pretty emotional and pretty rough for me .
I was actually in tears when I was making the record . ''
The song samples `` Pilentze Pee , '' as performed by The Bulgarian choir , Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares .
The song 's music video was directed by Colin Tilley , who shot the singer 's previous visual for `` It Girl . ''
DeRulo studied theater in college and we see him flex his acting chops when , haunted by the ghost of his ex , he simulates a seizure in an electric chair .
