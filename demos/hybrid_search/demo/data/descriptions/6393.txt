All the lyrics are in French , save for one chorus -LRB- `` No matter what I do , I 'm still hungry for you '' -RRB- and the outro , where the English portion of the title is repeated several times until the fadeout .
The Police recorded this in Montserrat , which is an island in the Caribbean .
The police were deeply influenced by the music of the Caribbean -LRB- Reggae music -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , Mylene - Guadeloupe French West Indies , France -RRB- This foreign-language song was just one example of how Ghost In The Machine marked a turning point for The Police .
Whereas their first 3 album releases reflected their strong Reggae and Punk roots , Ghost saw the band move toward a more mainstream Pop sound , while at the same time exploring new musical territory and themes .
This trend would continue , and culminate , with Synchronicity , which would turn out to be their final , and most commercially successful , studio album together .
-LRB- thanks , Joshua - Twin Cities , MN .
for above 2 -RRB-
