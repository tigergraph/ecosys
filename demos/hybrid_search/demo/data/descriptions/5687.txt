This song is based on a traditional Spanish fair ground melody .
The Pogues guitarist Phillip Chevron on the Shane Macgowan website describes the genesis of this song : `` Fiesta actually came out from our time in Spain .
This song is about the time we were in Almeria filming Straight To Hell .
We had peculiar hours .
We would get up at 6 in the morning and drive to the set , which was about 25 miles from the hotel .
This meant that we had to get to bed relatively early , which was difficult enough for The Pogues .
The actual hotel in the film is the one we stayed in .
Typically we would get back at 8 O'clock , have a bite to eat and a few drinks to unwind and then go to bed .
We were filming at Fiesta time , and the Spanish take their Fiestas very seriously .
The problem with the Fiesta is that they start at sun down and continue to sun up .
That would n't be too bad except the noise of the fiesta is something else .
All through the time we were in Almeria there was 2 tunes that kept playing , they came like Chinese water torture .
It would stop for 5 minutes and then start again .
The first tune was what we made the main tune in ` Fiesta ' and the other one was the coming from the doll-selling stall .
You know the line ` will you kindly kill a doll for me ! ' ''
The Video was directed by the British comedian and actor Adrian Edmondson .
