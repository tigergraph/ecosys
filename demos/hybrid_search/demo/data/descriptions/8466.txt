This song finds Ke $ ha opening up about her mistakes and flaws before she pledges in the chorus , `` Maybe it 's about time to let love back in the light .
Maybe it 's about the perfect place .
Let go and forget about the hate .
`` Speaking with MTV News , Ke $ ha explained the track is , `` a song that talks about how imperfections are what make life beautiful .
Rather than try to cause divisions between people because of our differences and imperfections why do n't we all let a little more love into the light .
It 's a subject that many people have written about , but I do n't think it can be said enough . ''
Ke $ ha co-wrote the track with Greg Kurstin , who also manned the boards .
The Californian producer has accumulated quite a resume , having worked on such hits as Pink 's `` Blow Me -LRB- One Last Kiss -RRB- '' and Kelly Clarkson 's `` What Does n't Kill You -LRB- Stronger -RRB- . ''
Lyrically , this is one of several tracks on Warrior that reveal the vulnerable side of Ke $ ha .
She told Reuters : `` I just wanted to make sure my entire personality was presented more accurately .
I feel like people really got to know the super-wild side of me but then sometimes a more vulnerable side .
I did n't really feel comfortable expressing it .
So this time I kind of forced myself to express a little bit more vulnerability , less Auto-Tune , less vocal trickery .
It 's a little more raw . ''
