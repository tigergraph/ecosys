This mid tempo R&B song was released as the first single from Fantasia 's The Side Effects of You album .
`` Have you ever needed someone so bad ?
But he ai n't willing to make it last .
Sometimes you got ta lose to win again , '' she croons about moving on .
The lyrics may reference Fantasia 's split from the father of her son , Antwaun Cook .
This song was inspired by the overwhelming public ridicule arising from Fantasia 's relationship with a married man that drove her to attempt suicide in 2010 .
The singer penned the tune with composer Andrea Martin .
`` We sat down and put our feelings into the song , '' Fantasia told The Drop.FM .
`` It was the last song we recorded , so it was so special .
It was special to her .
We both have been through some things . ''
Fantasia added that she turned her negative experiences into a positive outlook on life .
`` I 've lost a lot , but I 'm winning now .
When I say winning , I am not talking about money , cars or material things .
I am finally at peace , '' she said . ''
` Lose to Win ' had to be my first single because it is my testimony .
I want to acknowledge the small things in life that we forget .
I am not just talking about relationships .
We lose jobs , homes , look at the people in Boston -LSB- the interview was done just after the Boston Marathon 's terrorist bombings -RSB- . ''
The song samples the Commodores ' 1985 single , `` Nightshift . ''
Fantasia told CBS Local that when she first heard the tune , she `` was blown away with the feel . ''
`` When I heard the track , I was done , '' she continued .
`` When I heard the lyrics of the song , it was n't just about a relationship it was about my whole career .
There have been ups and downs . ''
