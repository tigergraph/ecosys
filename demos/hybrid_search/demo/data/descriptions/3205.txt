Lead singer Andrew Schwab explained to jesusfreakhideout.com : `` Unity is found in genuine connection .
And the promise to a brother or sister in need that you will be there is worth more than it 's weight in gold .
This is that promise .
We will be there for one another to lend sight , even when the darkness is pitch .
We 'll find new meaning in humility before one another , in vulnerability and honor , being broken together so we can stand strong . ''
