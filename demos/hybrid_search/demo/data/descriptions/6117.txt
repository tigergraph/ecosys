The fourth single from Pitbull 's Global Warming album was produced by Lucas Secon and features vocals from the American singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera .
It was released November 6 , 2012 .
Pitbull makes reference to E.L. James ' best-selling erotic novel 50 Shades Of Grey when he raps : `` She read books , especially about red rooms and tie ups . ''
The book is notable for its explicit sex scenes featuring elements of bondage and female submission .
This samples the riff of A-ha 's 1985 hit `` Take On Me . ''
Pitbull said in a video interview regarding the song : '' ` Feel This Moment ' is a special record , and to work with Christina Aguilera is an honor , a blessing , someone that I highly respected , as far as her talent , her voice , her range that she can take it , and I think ` Feel This Moment ' is gon na be a great record , because it 's got a very powerful sample and everybody 's gon na dance too .
On top of that , when I say ` Feel this Moment ' is basically , ` feel life , do n't live life for a moment , live life for life , that is your moment . ' ''
