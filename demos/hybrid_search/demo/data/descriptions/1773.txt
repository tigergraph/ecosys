This song is based around English producer Gold Panda 's 2010 track , `` You . ''
Charli explained to The Sun : `` I was just f -- ing around with the idea of singing over Gold Panda 's ` You , ' which I sample in the song , then everyone started saying it was really good .
I 'm a big fan of Gold Panda 's work and it was an honor when he said I could use it officially . ''
The controversial video finds Charli loading gun shells in a firearms factory and trading the lead tips for lipstick .
Its release could n't have been timed any worse coming just weeks after the Newtown , Connecticut , shooting .
The singer issued a response saying in part , `` The idea is to make lipstick , not war , but I 'd like to say sorry if anyone has mistaken this video for advocating violence . ''
