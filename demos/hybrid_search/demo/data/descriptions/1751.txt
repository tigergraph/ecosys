3 Doors Down singer Brad Arnold explained the song 's meaning to Artist Direct editor Rick Florino : `` That song is about getting tired of putting up with somebody 's s -- t -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
The key line in that song is ' I could spend my whole life waiting on your words ' instead of just saying , ` Screw it , I 'm doing it like I want to . '
I think that 's important for everybody at some point in their life .
You can be shown examples and be taught this or that .
Ultimately , it 's up to you to do it the way you do it . ''
