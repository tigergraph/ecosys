Stephenie Meyer , who wrote the original novel , is a big fan of Muse and after this song was placed on the Twilight soundtrack , the band 's popularity jumped .

In year after the film hit screens , the track sold over 300,000 .
Muse 's manager Cliff Burnstein recalled to Billboard magazine : `` Some time ago , when the band was playing in Arizona , we invited -LSB- Meyer -RSB- to a show .
Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke wanted to use ` Supermassive ' in a very long scene , with not a lot of dialogue in the foreground .
We thought , ` This is fun ; this is a nice woman who writes these books , she 's a fan of ours , let 's get involved in this . '
No one was really thinking at the time , ` This is a huge opportunity . ' ''
