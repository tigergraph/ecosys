A 19 year old Prince released his debut album For You on April 7 , 1978 .
The opening track was a capella running to a mere 1 minute 6 seconds .
In a BBC documentary screened in November 2011 , it was described by one contact as `` simply fantastic '' and was recorded to showcase his talent .
The record buying public did not agree , at least initially , and the album reached only number 163 in the US charts although it went on to achieve significant sales , and of course the man 's recording career speaks for itself .
Like the bulk of his work , `` For You '' was written by Prince , and is not to be confused with any other song of the same name , including the Judie Tzuke capella in counterpoint which was released the following year , and which includes a string arrangement after the vocal introduction .
