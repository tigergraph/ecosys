Las Vegas Rock band The Killers are recognized for their work with the Product Red campaign , an international charity dedicated to raising funds and awareness for HIV and AIDS .
In 2006 they released their first Christmas themed song and music video , `` A Great Big Sled , '' in aid of the charity .
Their festive tunes have subsequently became an annual event and this is their sixth successive release intended to raise money for the Product Red campaign .
The track was released as a digital download on December 1 , 2011 .
Back in 1991 Michael Martin Murphey adapted the same poem for a track on his festive album , Cowboy Christmas : Cowboy Songs II .
-LRB- Some you might recall Murphey 's 1972 top 40 hit , `` Geronimo 's Cadillac . '' -RRB-
Speaking about the inspiration for the track , drummer Ronnie Vannucci told NME their original source was William Lawrence Chittenden 's 1890 poem of the same name .
`` Brandon -LRB- Flowers -RRB- had a book of cowboy poetry and we took one of those and put music to it , '' he explained .
`` It 's got this 1800s parlance , Western style .
It 's pretty upbeat and very down-home sounding - and overall pretty cool . ''
