Frontman Harry McVeigh told The Sun January 16 , 2009 , that this anthemic track , which features a 20-piece orchestra , is an important song for the band .
He explained : `` We only had a very rough version of it when we went into the studio but it came together very quickly .
It 's got a huge string section on it and sounds big and grand .
That was exactly the sound we wanted from the album and when we achieved that so early on , it was a great moment for us . ''
