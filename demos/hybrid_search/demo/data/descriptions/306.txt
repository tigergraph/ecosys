This break-up anthem finds Carly outlining her plans to dance away the heartbreak .
`` No more crying , '' she sings , `` to get me through .
I 'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new . ''
The song was released as the fourth international single from her second studio album , Kiss .
The song was produced by the Swedish hitmaking duo of Max Martin and Shellback .
The duo specialises in working with female pop performers and is the mastermind behind hits by the likes of Britney Spears , Pink , Taylor Swift and Avril Lavigne .
Nicki Minaj recorded a verse for a remixed version of the song .
Jepsen 's manager Scooter Braun told MTV News : `` When Carly Rae and Nicki get together , they make songs about getting over guys .
Whenever girls do songs about getting over men , they seem to do really well .
`` Minaj previously worked with another of Scooter Braun 's singers ' , Justin Bieber , on `` Beauty And A Beat . ''
Jepsen penned the song with Clarence Coffee Jr. , Shiloh and Katerina Loules.Clarence Coffee Jr. is a member of the American The Monsters and The Strangerz production and songwriting team , whose credits include `` Turn Around -LRB- 5,4,3,2,1 -RRB- '' by Flo Rida and `` Swagger Jagger '' by Cher Lloyd.Shiloh , is a Canadian pop singer and songwriter who was listed as Billboard Canada 's # 1 Emerging Talent Artist on December 19 , 2008 .
Her self-penned debut single `` Operator -LRB- A Girl Like Me -RRB- '' was a # 30 hit in her native county in 2008 .
Katerina Loules , also known as Tryna , is a German singer and songwriter .
After taking part in singing reality show Popstars at the age of 16 , she hooked up with German songwriter/producer Lukas Hilbert to record two duets , `` Kommt meine Liebe nicht bei dir an '' and `` Der Rang , '' both of which reached the top 40 in her native country .
This was inspired by a real-life broken relationship .
Jepsen told People magazine : `` I hope you have n't experienced it , but I certainly have had that relationship that is on-again , off-again and good and bad .
With this particular song , it was sort of that decision that even though -LSB- the relationship -RSB- is hot and cold , sometimes you 've got to move on . ''
The song describes the need to move on from a relationship gone bad , which Carly told New York radio station 92.3 NOW is something all of us can relate to .
`` Unfortunately , I 'm pretty sure all of us can admit to that moment where there 's been somebody who , you know , it did n't just totally work out or they did n't like you the way you wanted them to like you , '' she said .
`` That 's kinda what the song is about ... coming to terms with that and then moving on and , you know , doing the classic ... ` find somebody new . ' ''
