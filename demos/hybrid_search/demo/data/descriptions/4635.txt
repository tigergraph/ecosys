Shelby Lynne wrote this song and originally intended it for her 1999 album , I Am Shelby Lynne .
Nine years later , her sister Allison Moorer covered the song on her Mockingbird album , which was a collection of songs by the artists who influenced her most .
Moorer explained in an interview with Gene Myers : `` When I started thinking about this album , I wanted to include something from her because it would have been silly for me not to .
She 's my big sister .
She 's been very influential on me musically and otherwise .
At the same time , I needed something that she had n't put out because - even though we are very different , we can sound very alike .
If I put out something that she put out already , it would have been like , ` What 's the point ? ' ''
