This was the first song that Avenged Sevenfold wrote for Hail to the King , hence it being a throwback to band 's traditional sound .
Guitarist Synyster Gates told MusicRadar.com : `` It 's a little progressive , but we wanted to maintain some space in the arrangement so the drums could shine and the riffs and vocals could breathe . ''
He added : `` This is a lot of guitar , though , some big moments .
If you 're not the biggest groove fan -- and it you 're not , you should be -- there 's still a progressive element .
So it 's a mix , this song , and it worked out really well . ''
Vocalist M. Shadows is singing here about religious fanaticism and witch hunts .
He explained to Kerrang !
magazine : `` To me , this is about the Salem Witch Trials .
It 's about the West Memphis Three .
It 's about being put in jail for life for the clothes you wear and because you have long hair .
And it 's all based on religion and fantasy , when no-one can just look at the facts for what they are , because they 're completely clouded by their love of their religious beliefs .
That song is a step back to say , ` You do n't have to be at someone 's door , ready to burn them without giving them a chance to explain themselves . ''
