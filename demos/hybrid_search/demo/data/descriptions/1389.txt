Vocalist Dave King explained this song to Alternative Press magazine : `` That 's another one of those -LSB- songs about -RSB- keeping your head above water , above all the bulls -- t we have to deal with in life , doing it with a swagger and a sense of humor .
Always put out a positive energy .
Rise above things that try to drag you down .
You have to make peace , but you have to make peace with yourself . ''
