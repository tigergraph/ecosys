This rocking track by Snoop Dogg was produced by and features rapper Kanye West .
R&B singer John Legend also appears on the song , which finds the veteran Hip-Hop kingpin paying respect to the younger generation while reasserting his status .
The song samples old school rapper Jimmy Spicer 's 1983 track `` Money -LRB- Dollar Bill Y' all -RRB- . ''
Maino borrowed from the same song for his breakout single `` Hi Hater . ''
The song originated during a session in New York when Snoop and Kanye were working in the same studio .
`` I was in the studio with Swizz Beatz and walked down the hallway and heard some beats , and it was Kanye West , '' the West Coast rhymer recalled to MTV News .
`` He called me into the studio and played me a couple of songs from his album .
He was like , ' I got this song that 's not gon na make the album , but listen to it . ' ''
