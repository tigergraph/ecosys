This is the last track from Speed Of Darkness , the fifth studio album by the Irish-American Celtic punk band Flogging Molly .
Vocalist Dave King explained to Alternative Press magazine why the band chose this song to close the set : `` That had to be the closer .
The album 's all about life and its good and its bad .
It 's a positive end to the way I see life .
It 's rising up and getting your head above the bulls -- t - even if it 's one person at a time , it 's still a positive motion .
I want that wheel to keep in motion .
If it 's me today , it 'll be somebody else tomorrow .
I want that for humanity .
I want us to f -- in ' rise up above this s -- t .
That was the way I heard the album end . ''
The song finds King championing defiant hope .
He explained to Alternative Press : `` I remember watching a wonderful show in Ireland on the television , it 's called Reeling In The Years .
It has Irish history and everything involved in whatever year they 're talking about .
When Ireland was going through its really bad trouble in the North -LSB- in the 1970s -RSB- , there was a meeting in a hall .
And it was about the Catholic people who were looking for a one-man-one-vote campaign where they could actually vote .
And all the men , women , children sitting in this hall , they were singing ` We Shall Overcome , ' and it really hit me , and it reminded me of the Martin Luther King days .
And I just had to put that lyric in the chorus . ''
