On this call-to-arms , the Sugarland duo exhort listeners to `` use your voice . ''
This tale of personal empowerment is one of two songs on The Incredible Machine to showcase Kristian Bush 's voice .
`` I do n't know how many people have really ever heard me sing before , '' he said of his lead verse .
`` For fans of the band , it 's like a whole new layer is peeled back . ''
Bush told The Boot that even though the song has a strong message , it was n't inspired by any particular event .
He explained : `` There are a lot of messages we put in our songs , and we try to make them honest but subtle .
We do n't want to beat you over the head with it , because real life is n't like that .
Real life has meaning in the smallest thing .
Like when I dropped off my daughter at her first day at kindergarten , I heard Kenny Chesney 's ` Do n't Blink ' in the car on the way back .
You 're finding that really powerful moment , no matter how small , and making it important in your life .
` Stand Up ' comes from a long history of activism of the heart .
I 've been really humbled watching people 's reaction to it , because they can write their own script for what they believe in but have not used their voice to say .
It 's the first song of our encore , and I 'll never forget when we played it in Iowa , we got to the first chorus , and everybody in that small town was maybe a little self-conscious about letting go ... because maybe they were all gon na see each other in church that Sunday !
-LSB- laughs -RSB- But we played that song and the whole place stood up as if on command . ''
