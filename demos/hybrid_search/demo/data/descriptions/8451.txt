T.I. wrote this song in honor of his cousin Toot and his good friend J-Rue .
His cousin would always encourage him to pursue his music career , and introduced him to some of the people who gave him his start .
Toot was murdered in his own home , and did n't get to see T.I. make it big .
J-Rue was a good friend , but they got in a dispute about money and lost contact with each other .
About a year later , J-Rue was killed , and T.I. was never able to patch things up with him .
Jamie Foxx sings on this track with T.I.
