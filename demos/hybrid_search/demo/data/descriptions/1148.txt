This is a cover of a track from Australian rock group Nick Cave and the Bad Seed 's 1992 album , Henry 's Dream .
It might seem like a puzzling choice for somebody with Groban 's fan base , however the singer told Billboard magazine that he 's a long-time fan of Cave 's , and when producer Rick Rubin suggested he try it out , he went for it .
Said Groban : `` I trust Rick for a gazillion things , and I certainly trust him for cover songs .
We got James Newton Howard to create a sonic atmosphere to represent what the words are .
At first , I started off telling him , ' I want Terry Gilliam , I want Baron Munchausen , I want cannons coming through the opera house . '
And then I realized that was exactly what we should n't be doing ; that we should just let the words do the talking .
We wound up making it more haunting , and when I went back and listened to it , it moved me . ''
