The xx close their sophomore album Coexist with this minimalist ballad in which the trio pay tribute to each other .
`` And there 's no one else .
Who knows me .
Like you do .
What I 've done , you 've done too , '' sings guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim .
`` It 's a friendship song , '' Madley Croft told Spin magazine .
`` It 's the first time we 've kind of just written about the love of friendship .
Oliver and I felt quite keen to write a song that we felt reflected off each other .
It 's for Jamie -LSB- Smith , DJ-producer -RSB- as well .
It 's the only song where I 've ever addressed Oliver and he 's addressing me . ''
The xx titled the album Coexist to get across unity and togetherness .
Sim explained to 7Digital United Kingdom : `` There was talk of calling the album ` Together ' but , even though it 's such a simple word , for me it 's very ` nice ' and conjures up quite a twee image .
I think we wanted to do something with a darkness to it , that was a bit more honest about how relationships can be .
`` He continued : `` Romy found the word ` coexist ' when doing artwork research .
She was looking at the way oil and water make those beautiful rainbows when mixed together and found a line about it : ` Oil and water do n't mix , they agree to peacefully coexist . '
She 's a bit of a romantic and really liked that , and saw a mirror in what we do -- in that we 're three separate people and we only make this music when we come together .
So the word ` coexist ' seemed a lot more honest and it felt right . ''
