This song was written by the Country singer Katrina Elam and songwriter Mike Mobley , whose tunes have been recorded by Martina McBride , Kenny Chesney and Jason Aldean .
Elam toured with Rascal Flatts in 2006 to promote her unreleased second album , Turn Me Up .
Bedingfield discussed her contribution to this song in an interview with Billboard magazine : `` I 've always had very eclectic and varied tastes in music , '' she said .
`` I think you 're always going to see that from me , just working with people in different genres .
I love it .
Rascal Flatts were fantastic ; I 've always been into folk music and Americana , people like Johnny Cash , so I feel that 's quite linked to country music .
And I know Rascal Flatts are classified as pop/country , definitely more in that world .
So it was like opening a window for me . ''
The song features English pop singer-songwriter Natasha Bedingfield .
`` We had a blast recording with Natasha , '' said Gary LeVox .
`` I 've always been addicted to great singers and she is certainly one of the best .
It was an honor to sing with her . ''
Bassist Jay DeMarcus told Billboard magazine it was Gary LeVox 's idea to record this as a duet .
He recalled : `` It was one of those songs that was pitched to us for the last record , and we fell in love with it immediately .
I think it was Gary 's idea on the bus one day - ` You know , this could be a cool duet . '
The more we talked about it , the more it made sense .
We were huge fans of Natasha 's .
We sent her the song , she knew who we were , and was a fan of country music .
She had known us for ` God Bless the Broken Road ' and ` What Hurts The Most . '
She came to Nashville , and watching the two of them in the studio was very inspiring . ''
