The hero , Ulysses , is trying to get home across the ocean after the Trojan War , but the gods keep making it difficult : `` Though the danger on the rocks is surely past , still I remain tied to the mast `` These lyrics refer to an incident where Ulysses had all his crew block their ears so they would n't hear the Sirens ' song and crash the boat on the rocks , but Ulysses kept his ears open and had his crew tie him to the mast so he would n't dive off the boat .
