Steven Wold is an American blues musician who performs under the name of Seasick Steve .
At the age of 13 , Wold left home to avoid abuse at the hands of his stepfather , and lived rough and on the road .
He would travel long distances across the southern states of America by hopping freight trains , as he looked for work as a farm labourer or in other seasonal jobs , often living as a hobo .
This first single from his sixth studio album , You Ca n't Teach an Old Dog New Tricks album , was inspired by his own time on the road . ''
` Treasures ' come about by me remembering wandering down a street in some town , seeing people lookin at me , wondering what I was doin there and hoping I wer n't gon na ask them for nothin , '' explained Wold to Spinner UK .
`` And I was feelin kinda free , and to me they seemed like they was in a prison .
Well , I did n't want nothin from them .
There you go . ''
When asked about his nickname by Spinner , Wold said : `` because it 's just true : I always get seasick . ''
