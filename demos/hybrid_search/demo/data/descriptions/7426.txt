South African post-grunge/alternative metal band Seether 's fifth studio album was produced by Brendan O'Brien and released on May 17 , 2011 .
It was the only Seether album to feature guitarist Troy McLawhorn due to his departure from the band before the album release .
Morgan explained the song 's meaning to Artist Direct : `` That was about coming to a realization when you 're in a situation in a relationship where the only thing that really keeps everything going is both of you are either getting wasted or high the whole time .
When you sober up at the end of the period that took way too long to get to , you realize there 's really nothing going on .
It was loosely based on something like that . ''
Frontman and songwriter Shaun Morgan told Artist Direct the story behind the album 's closing track : `` The piano part in the bridge is what the song was really built around .
We took that bridge , and Dale -LSB- Stewart , bass -RSB- came up with the melody line and choruses which we combined .
It came together from a bunch of different pieces .
On my iPod , I have a thirteen minute version of that song that we first jammed on -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
`` There was something about it that felt really epic .
` Dramatic ' would be the best description .
It felt like the best way to finish the album .
There 's so much going on in the song .
The idea was to make it a really intense finish . ''
