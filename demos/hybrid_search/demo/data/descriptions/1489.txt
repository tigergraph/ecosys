Linkin Park open their fifth studio album , Living Things , with this track , which finds Chester Bennington singing about broken promises .
He exhorts the listener to get up again and find their own strength after someone has trusted has betrayed them .
Bennington told Spin magazine that the record 's lyrics were personal rather than political , and majored on relationships .
`` Once we start hitting lyrical themes that can whack you from all these different perspectives , we know we 're onto something special , '' he said .
`` That 's when the hair starts standing up .
We do n't sit down and go , ` People are uneasy about the economy .
Let 's write about that . '
We got a little more poetic , a little more colorful this time .
A lot of the songs revolve around people - a drifter , or a soldier returning home , or a child finding his or her place in the family . ''
The interactive music video was co-directed by music video and film director Jason Zada , and developer Jason Nickel .
It creates the storyline by asking permission for temporary access to the user 's Facebook photos and incorporating them in the visual.Mike Shinoda told O Music Awards Blog about the clip : `` The idea of the song and the video at its core , really , has to do with finding the issues or the baggage that is weighing you down and letting go of it .
So in the context of just that storyline -- even if it was n't an interactive video -- that would be really what it 's all about .
The addition of the Facebook Connect part of it -- I thought that really took things to another level .
It really becomes personalized in that respect -- when somebody connects their images and their own personal stories into the story of the song or the video . ''
