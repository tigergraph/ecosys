This is the debut single from the Brian `` Head '' Welch fronted Christian metal band Love and Death .
Brian Welch told us the story of the song : `` I just remember being kind of stuck in the studio , '' he recalled .
`` We got a couple parts here and there and I was leaving .
I was talking to the producer and I just heard this -LSB- making music sounds -RSB- . ''
`` And it was just repetitive , '' Welch added .
`` So I went home and I was driving .
And I was just kind of hearing it in my mind and I went home and I opened Garage Band on my laptop and just laid down the idea of the riff and brought it back .
The next day , we had I think the full song or a half of it . ''
`` It 's cool .
They call it writer 's block when you get in the studio and you ca n't write , and then all of a sudden something just bursts open . ''
`` And to me , that song could be about drug use or depression , the chemicals in your brain that cause depression . ''
Welch explained the album title to Legendary Rock Interviews : `` The actual album concept is all about walking through difficulties and getting through them which seems to be what I 'm good at in life .
Our bass player came up with the name and I just thought it fit perfectly with so much of the lyrics and the overall idea . ''
He added : `` When I saw the artwork for the album , there were a couple different choices you know , but when I saw that picture it just made sense .
It looked like desolate land and tied it all together , it all went well , the title , the band name , the packaging and everything . ''
