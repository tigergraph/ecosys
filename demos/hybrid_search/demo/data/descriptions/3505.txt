Vocalist Ed Macfarlane told the story of the song to NME : `` The beat is based on a Flying Lotus drumbeat ... I 'm a big fan .
We were listening to New Kids On The Rock , Backstreet Boys , Nsync .
Especially NKOTB - that album was done on 808s , 909s , that 's the core of the record .
This track has a definite hip hop edge , but from a boy band perspective . ''
