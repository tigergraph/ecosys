In this song , Heath talks about how he was a troublesome child , but grew into a strong man under the watch of God .
When we spoke with Brandon Heath in 2011 , he explained : `` I was n't the worst kid .
I 'm an only child , so I got all the attention from my parents .
I was a little bit of a people pleaser and hated to get into trouble .
But I was pretty bad at school .
I did n't make good grades and I talked a lot .
It was n't like anything major , but it was just not very conducive to learning and all that stuff .
And I remember bringing home really horrific report cards and my parents wondering , Man , what 's gon na give ?
And what are you going to be able to do in college ?
And a lot of it was that I was going through a hard time : my parents were divorcing .
When the dust settled , like any other kid , there comes a time when it just clicks and you just do it , because you want to do it.So college was better for me and I actually did pretty well in college and graduated with an English degree .
But for me there came a point when I had to realize that I was in a longer story and my life was only just beginning in those times .
When I wrote that song , I literally was thinking about middle school kids .
What an awkward time .
You 're growing into your teeth ... -LRB- laughs -RRB- Remember when your teeth were bigger than everything else in your body ?
But you 're starting to date a little bit and all that stuff .
So if you can tell kids , ` Hey , this is just a phase and it 's gon na get a lot easier from here , ' I think they 'd maybe take themselves a lot less serious and it 'd be easier for them . ''
