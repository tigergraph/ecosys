An evil banjo stalks Cohen in this folk-bluesy meditation of surrender .
`` There 's a broken banjo bobbing on a dark infested sea , '' he croons .
During a press preview of Old Ideas in London -LRB- as reported by The Sun -RRB- Cohen was asked if the broken banjo was something he had actually seen ?
`` I do n't know whether I actually saw it .
I certainly imagined it , '' replied the poet-singer , before acknowledging that there 's something `` hilarious '' about the bobbing banjo even in this dark and dangerous setting .
