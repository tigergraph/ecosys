This dance track with a 4/4 beat tells the story of a successful singer who when his girlfriend disappears on a career of her own , finds that he misses her .
Several tracks on Freedom took their cues from European dance music , a move several other American R&B singers made in 2008 .
Akon explained to BBC News why he decided to expand his `` Konvict '' sound .
Said the Senegal-born singer : `` It all starts with the artist that actually travels .
Me , Ne-Yo , Chris Brown , Rihanna - we all spend a lot of time in places like the UK , France , Italy and Germany .
Places where they actually play this type of music .
And we see the effect that it gives to people in the club .
So naturally , you want your fans to be able to experience that . ''
