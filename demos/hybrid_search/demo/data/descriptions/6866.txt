This set the record for the most downloads in an iTunes `` Single of the Week '' campaign , when the song was featured during the first week of January 2009 .
McCarley told LAist her songwriting process : `` I usually start with some sort of melody .
I 'm a vocalist over an instrumentalist , so I 'm usually humming a melody in my head , then I 'll follow it with a guitar .
Usually , if it 's something that I 'm really into and can feel , some words will come out that reflect the same emotion as the music . ''
This uplifting track seemingly contains a number of references to the 1939 film , The Wizard of Oz .
However , in an interview with the LAist , McCarley denied this was intentional .
The singer-songwriter explained : `` I do n't think I meant to do that .
-LRB- laughs -RRB- I do n't really play piano , but that was the first time I wrote on piano , and I was just in my apartment dinking around on this crappy Casio .
I was literally playing with two fingers doing this `` Chopsticks '' - type thing and I just started singing .
It 's really weird when phrases fly out of your mouth that you 're not intending , and you do n't even necessarily know what it means at the time .
It was just this imagery .
I do n't know why I went to Yellow Brick Road ! ''
