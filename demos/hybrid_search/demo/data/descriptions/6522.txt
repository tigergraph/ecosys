This was the first of a number of songs that Cole recorded with Will.i.am in Los Angeles .
The Girls Aloud singer wrote verses around Will.i.am 's hook , which was inspired by his girlfriend .
After Cole had guested on the Black Eyed Pea band member 's 2008 single `` Heartbreaker , '' the pair struck up a friendship and started writing together .
Over the course of six months they produced four of the eleven tracks on the album .
Cole said : `` I was used to putting vocals onto a finished track .
But with Will I was seeing music being made right from the ground up .
He 'd ask my opinion on the beats and the words and send me off to write hooks .
To begin with I 'd come back dying with embarrassment . ''
