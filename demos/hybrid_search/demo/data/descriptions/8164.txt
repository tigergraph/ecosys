Designed as a sequel to Alice 's 1975 concept album , Welcome to My Nightmare , Welcome 2 My Nightmare features a number of surprising guests including Country singer Vince Gill and on this song global Pop superstar Ke $ ha .
`` That 's my rebellion , '' said Alice .
`` I like people that do n't belong and yet what they 're doing works perfectly .
I do n't care where it comes from , as long as it 's right .
If you tell me something does n't work , I 'll work my head off until it does then shove it down your throat . ''
Alice told Billboard magazine why he hooked up with the TiK ToK singer : `` I met -LRB- Ke $ ha -RRB- at the Grammys , '' he said , `` and I immediately looked at her and went , ` This girl is not a pop diva .
She 's a rock singer . '
She would much rather be the female Robert Plant than the next Britney Spears .
-LRB- Ezrin -RRB- said , ` Nobody 's gon na expect Ke $ ha on your album . '
` Great !
Let 's do it ! ' ''
Alice commented regarding Ke $ ha 's contribution on this song : `` I think a lot of my audience is going to go ` KE$ HA !? ' , but she probably wrote the most wicked lyrics in the song -- we had to rein her in .
I like people to know that just because artists are put in a pigeon hole , that does n't mean that 's what they are .
Give people a little room . ''
Alice told Classic Rock Revisited he chose Ke $ ha to play the devil in this song .
He explained : `` I met Ke $ ha at the Grammys and she never looked , to me , like a Diva , she looked like a rock singer .
I told her , ` Eventually , everyone leaves the Divas .
There is no way you can have a long lasting career as no one ends up loving the Divas forever .
However , everybody loves a rock band . '
It 's true , no one ever says anything bad about Chrissie Hynde .
I am trying to talk her into getting a real rock band behind her.When I met her , I had an idea for a song .
I needed a character to play the devil .
In the song , she finally has enough , and its time for Alice to pay her with his soul .
We decided to call it ` What Baby Wants Baby Gets ' because in the song he tries to say , ` Hey , that was n't part of the deal ' and she says , ` No , no , no , you do n't understand , what baby wants , baby gets ! '
For me , it was a perfect line for her to say . ''
