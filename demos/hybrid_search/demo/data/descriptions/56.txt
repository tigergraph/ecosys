This bluesy rock waltz was co-written by Cale Mills , who is an Arkansas friend of Allen .
Mills accompanied his buddy on his audition for American Idol and is now a member of the `` Idol '' champ 's band .
Allen and Dr. Dre/Eminem associate Mike Elizondo also have writing credits on the track .
Allen told MTV News that he was so thrilled with this song , that he dropped `` From the Ashes '' - a track hyped to journalists in an early album preview - to make room for this tune .
`` It 's not that I did n't like -LSB- ` From the Ashes ' -RSB- .
For me , I liked ` Is It Over ' -LSB- more -RSB- , and it was either/or . ''
Allen said .
