This song is about a guy and a girl that have been best friends for some time .
The girl finally realizes that she is in love with him , but is scared to be alone .
The guy has waited for her for so long , he is so happy that she finally realizes that they were meant to be , and he explains that they wo n't ever be alone , because he will always be there for her : `` Embrace forever my sweet girl . ''
