Singer Michael Barnes told Artist Direct about the meaning of this piano and strings backed song : `` There are very tender moments in there .
The song is just talking about somebody you may have lost -- a loved one or somebody who had gone off to war and is missing .
It 's that idea of emotional yearning for finding that person once again .
Kerrie Roberts finishes the song out and it really tells the story if you listen to it .
She 's in the realm of that person who 's lost or missing .
In the bridge , you 'll hear my world and her world come together .
There 's a part where we harmonize , and it 's like me reaching out to that world and catching a glimpse of it for one moment . ''
