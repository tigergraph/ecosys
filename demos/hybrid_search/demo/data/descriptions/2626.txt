Andy Gibb was the brother of Barry , Maurice and Robin Gibb of The Bee Gees , and this song was written by Barry .
It 's a fairly dramatic love song , with the singer declaring his unending passion and stating that without her , he would die .
This was the first of 3 # 1 singles for Gibb , which made him the first male solo artist with 3 consecutive # 1 singles in the US .
The next single was '' -LRB- Love Is -RRB- Thicker Than Water , '' which was released when The Bee Gees were scoring huge hits from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack .
That song replaced `` Stayin ' Alive '' at # 1 and was bumped by `` Night Fever . ''
Gibb 's next single was `` Shadow Dancing , '' which he wrote with his brothers and also went to # 1 .
-LRB- thanks , Santiago - Colorado springs , CO -RRB-
