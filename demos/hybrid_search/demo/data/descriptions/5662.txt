Gene Simmons : '' ` War Machine ' started off , strangely enough , on a cheap miniature synthesizer .
I had been recording demos at home on a small four-track recording facility and wanted to do some different kinds of things .
I had bought the synthesizer just to add a layer of sound in the back of something , in back of a guitar .
But while fiddling with it , I fell on the ` War Machine ' riff .
The original ` War Machine ' was a song almost purely based around the riff .
The riff never stopped and the vocals continued over the guitar figure .
Michael James Jackson suggested bringing in a co-writer who would help with the lyrics .
He suggested a brand new writer , who was an up-and-coming recording artist himself , named Bryan Adams , and his co-writing partner , Jim Vallance .
Vallance , Adams and I would co-write ` War Machine ' and ` Rock and Roll Hell ' , both of which appeared on Creatures Of The Night .
Adams and Vallance added some choral passages and the basic lyrical content , including the title , ` War Machine ' . ''
