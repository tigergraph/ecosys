Kansas-born Jerrod Niemann is an American Country artist who has been active since 2001 .
Jamey Johnson and Garth Brooks are amongst the artists who have cut his songs .
This is his first single released through Brad Paisley 's record label , Sea Gayle .
On the face of it this is a light-hearted ditty about drinking songs , however Niemann explained to the Michigan radio station B93 he 's also trying to get a point across : `` Everybody in Nashville sits around and tries to figure out what all the people you play music for would like or dislike and really none of us know , '' he said .
`` If anybody has any ideas , it 's the people who are going out at night or playing honky tonks .
I had already been given a lot of flack for having so many drinking songs , that I went back and wrote a song called ` One More Drinking Song . '
The reason everybody tries to avoid them in Nashville is because they think that anybody besides guys will like it and I just thought that was ridiculous .
I was just mocking our system in town of how everybody thinks they know everything about everybody 's brain ... and they do n't . ''
