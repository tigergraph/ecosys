Kasabian guitarist and main songwriter Serge Pizzorno was inspired to pen this contemplation of the passage of time after hearing Pink Floyd 's `` Wish You Were Here '' on the radio when the band were in New York .
He told Q magazine : '' ` Neon Noon ' has got a bit of that feel , but also has a modern electro vibe to it too .
Acoustic guitars and The Chemical Brothers , and lyrics about skeletons in the desert under a neon sky .
-LRB- laughs -RRB- .
It 's amazing people still talk about that ` lad rock ' tag in relation to what we do .
It just makes them look foolish really , because it 's obvious they 're not actually listening to the music . ''
The song 's music video was shot by Pizzorno at home on his mobile phone .
He revealed that he was inspired to shoot the clip after turning off his son 's night light .
Said the songwriter : `` I was at home turning off Ennio 's night light and I noticed that it was projecting psychedelic images on my shirt , so I decided to shoot a little video for ` Neon Noon ' using my phone and 4 mirrors . ''
