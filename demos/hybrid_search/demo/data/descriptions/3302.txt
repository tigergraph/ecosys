This is the title track of Pop-Rock Singer-Songwriter Adam Lambert 's second album .
The song finds Lambert portraying himself as a rebel outsider : `` Well , I was walking for some time , '' he croons .
`` When I came across this sign .
Saying who are you and where are you from .
We do n't like when visitors come . ''
Lambert and Pharell Williams came up with this song after a conversation , `` about the music industry and life and identity . ''
Lambert told AOL Music : `` One of the main things we talked about , which kind of kicked off the song ` Trespassing , ' was different types of discrimination , and fitting into the world and finding your own path . ''
According to Lambert , he sees this song as `` a mission statement . ''
He explained to AOL Music : `` I felt like the lyrics of the song summed up what I 'm about as an artist and as a person .
I do feel like a trespasser , but not in a literal sense , because I do n't think I 've broken into any property recently .
On a more figurative level , I feel like I 'm very different than the normal dude .
I 'm pretty eccentric , and as far as the music industry is concerned , I feel like a bit of an outsider .
There are times when I feel like I 'm breaking new ground by breaking in . ''
Pharrell Williams ' production transforms the song into a funky , foot-stomping anthem .
Lambert told Billboard magazine that he hosted a Halloween party on a bus with about 25 friends , in which he trialled some of the songs he intended to include on his sophomore release .
Their favorable reaction to this track ensured it would make the album .
`` I found I really wanted to get into that funk , '' he said of the sound on Trespassing .
`` It 's disco , funk , dance for , like , now . ''
Lambert explained the song 's meaning to AOL Music : `` It 's about saying , `` I know I may not be welcome here , I know I 'm different and I know you 're saying ` keep out , ' but I 'm not going to let that stop me .
I 'm going to do what my heart is telling me to do and do it proudly . ''
The Trespassing album debuted at # 1 on the Billboard 200 .
This meant that Lambert became the first American artist to top the album chart as an openly gay man .
UK singer Elton John has had one chart-topping record after coming out - the soundtrack to The Lion King .
