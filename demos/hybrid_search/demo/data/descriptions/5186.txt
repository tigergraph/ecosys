This was the lead single from former Jack Penate backing singer Jessie Ware 's first studio album Devotion .
It was released in the United Kingdom as a Digital download on February 24 , 2012 .
The music video was directed by Kate Moross .
Ware discussed her approach to shooting the clip in an interview published in the Spring 2013 edition of V Magazine .
`` I wanted to be like , ` Bang !
I 'm not a backing singer anymore .
This is my song , and I 'm going to own it ' , '' she declared .
`` I watched loads of Whitney Houston clips the night before .
I wanted it to be over-the-top .
I wanted to behave like a popstar .
`` Ware had a last-minute mishap whilst filming the visual : `` I had a whiskey before we shot , '' she admitted , `` and on the second take I fell down the stairs ... There was blood everywhere ! ''
The drum loop used in the song 's chorus of the song was based on Prince 's `` The Ballad Of Dorothy Parker , '' a track from the Purple Maestro 's 1986 unreleased double LP Dream Factory .
A remix by Jessie 's friends , British electronic duo Disclosure , charted in both the Netherlands and Belgium , It also became a fixture of the 2012 Festival Circuit and made various year-end best-of lists .
