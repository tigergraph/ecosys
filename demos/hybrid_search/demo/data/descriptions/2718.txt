This is an adaptation of `` Telephone Romeo , '' a track from Pearl Snaps , a 1999 Country album by Jason Boland & the Stragglers .
Kid Rock explained to Billboard magazine : `` That was started by Jason Boland , a country singer , Oklahoma/Texas guy .
I always enjoyed his stuff .
I found that song , it was called ` Telephone Romeo , ' it was n't quite there yet .
I switched it around and made it about what I perceived to be a relationship about the girl you grow up next door to , she 's really the one you 're supposed to be with , but you 've got to go out and see it all first yet to realize that . ''
