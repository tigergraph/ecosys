Burt Bacharach wrote this with Hal David .
They are one of the most prolific and successful songwriting teams of the Rock era , and surprisingly , this song was never a hit .
Bacharach was the first to record it , but Roger Nichols , Sergio Mendez and Herb Alpert all covered the song .
Bacharach did n't sing on his version , but he did play piano .
He used a female session singer for the vocals , something he often did when recording his own songs .
The song has a Bossa Nova beat and lyrics where the singer asks for forgiveness and another chance .
Wondermints recorded this on their 1995 album Wonderful World Of Wondermints .
It is the only Wondermints song featuring Probyn Gregory on lead vocal .
He recorded his vocal around the time he and a longtime girlfriend had broken up and says that as a result , he was truly singing from his heart .
