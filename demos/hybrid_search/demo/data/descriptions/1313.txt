Prince got the idea for this when he dozed off in backup singer Lisa Coleman 's pink Edsel after an exhausting all night recording session .
The lyrics came to him in bits and pieces during this and other catnaps .
Eventually he was able to finish it without sleeping .
For Prince , this was his first big hit .
Over the next few years he had many more , making him extremely popular on radio stations and as a concert draw .
1999 was Prince 's 5th album .
He had a minor hit 4 years earlier with `` I Wan na Be Your Lover . ''
Stevie Nicks got the idea for `` Stand Back '' from this .
She heard it in her car , drove to recording studio , and put down some tracks .
Prince came in and added the keyboard bit .
`` 1999 '' was released before this and did n't do well , but it was re-released after this became a hit and went to # 12 in the US .
There was a Billboard for the Chevrolet Corvette made from this song as well .
It had the lyric `` Little Red Corvette , baby ur much 2 fast '' and Prince 's logo over the Corvette .
It was displayed behind the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green , Kentucky in 2003 .

Many of his earlier songs , like `` Head , '' `` Dirty Mind , '' and `` Soft And Wet , '' were blatantly sexual , which turned off radio stations .

This was much more slick , which led to radio play and commercial success .
The line , `` She had a pocket full of horses , Trojans , some of them used , '' refers to Trojan condoms .
The `` Jockeys '' represent men who have previously slept with the girl .

In 2001 , Chevrolet put up billboards with a picture of a red 1963 Corvette Sting Ray that said , `` They do n't write songs about Volvos . ''

The ad showed old footage of The Beach Boys performing `` My 409 '' followed by Don McLean singing `` American Pie '' -LRB- `` drove my Chevy to the levee '' -RRB- , and then Prince performing this .
The camera then goes outside the club to show Chevy 's latest model .
