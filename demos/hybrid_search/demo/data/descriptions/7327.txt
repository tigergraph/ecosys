This ballad about a man who remains silent about whether he loves his girlfriend or wants to leave her was co-written and produced by Lady Gaga 's collaborator RedOne .
Burke explained during a performance on The Paul O'Grady Show that the song was inspired by her auntie 's relationship with her boyfriend .
Said the singer : `` My auntie was going through that situation and she came over to L.A. to spend some time with me and get away from her fella etc. .
And she was telling me about her situation and -LSB- ... -RSB- why does he let the silence do the talking ?
Why does n't he let you know how he feels ?
And then this song came about . ''
This is one of four ballads on Overcome , including the bonus track .
Burke told Pop Justice that the ballads on the album reveal the open and demonstrative side of her personality .
She explained : `` When I 'm emotional , I let people see that .
That 's what the ballads portray about me , when I 'm having a down moment .
When I was recording this album , I 'd walk into the studio with my diary and we 'd write from that .
I 'd read paragraphs from my diary to the producer and if there was something going on with my sister or my auntie , I 'd write about that - I refuse to sing something that I do n't relate to , I 'm sorry .
There was a song where the producer tried to make me sing a lyric and it was too American for me , and I was like , `` no !
My audience wo n't get it . ''
This was released as the final single from Overcome .
Burke told Digital Spy why it was chosen : `` It was between ` Perfect ' and ` The Silence ' for the final single , but I went on Twitter and did an #AskAlex session and the fans wanted ` The Silence ' , so I had to give them what they wanted ! ''
