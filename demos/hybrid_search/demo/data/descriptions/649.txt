Legend signaled his support for presidential candidate Barack Obama by debuting this song at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on August 25 , 2008 .
Legend told CNN why he wrote this political rally cry with a straight forward message : `` I figured I could be ironic , I could be subtle , or I could be cynical , but why not just go out there and say it , you know .
Let 's make that anthem , try to get people to rally without being ashamed of the clearness and the boldness of the message .
Let 's just say it . ''
This was co-produced by the producer and songwriter Devo Springsteen , who in 2003 launched Legend 's career by signing him to the G.O.O.D. Music record label .
Also credited was legendary English producer Trevor Horn -LRB- `` Video Killed The Radio Star , '' `` Two Tribes '' -RRB- .
Legend expanded on this song to SoulTracks : `` There is a yearning in a way , because you 're wanting people to join you .
When I 'm out there doing my work for the ` Show Me ' campaign , sometimes you wonder if anybody 's listening , or if they care enough about the issues to make a difference .
The song is a call to action , a call to arms for anyone who has a mind to contribute and the motivation to actually do it .
What we 're trying to say is that the time is now , we 've already waited long enough to start working on the issues that we need to handle as a country and as a globe .
We 're talking about poverty , ending the war , and we need more people out there who are clamoring for change , it 's not just about electing Obama , it 's just about the mindset and putting pressure on the politicians to be more responsible . ''
