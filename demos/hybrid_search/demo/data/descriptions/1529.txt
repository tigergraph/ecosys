During the 2008 American elections , frontman John Gourley was in Germany and found himself discussing politics with a German .
The conversation made Gourley realize that his new friend knew far more about America and its political scene than he did about Germany 's .
That gave him the idea for the song .
`` I 've been to Germany nine or 10 times and know so little , if not absolutely nothing , about the country 's politics , '' Gourley told Spinner .
`` It 's just so funny because the way we -LSB- Americans -RSB- are is pretty relaxed , like , ` Do what you want .
I 'm not going to be a part of this . '
And I thought it 's so American to just let things go and say whatever and just let it happen . ''
