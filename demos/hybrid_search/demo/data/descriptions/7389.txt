`` You are a cinema , I could watch you forever .
Action , thriller , I could watch you forever .
You are a cinema , a Hollywood treasure , '' he croons .
Benassi has been a leading electro house producer and dance music DJ since the mid 1990s and in 2002 he scored a hit throughout Europe with `` International . ''
However , it was n't until his co-credited collaboration on Chris Brown 's 2011 international smash `` Beautiful People '' that he achieved success chartwise in the US .

Skrillex 's remix won Best Remixed Recording , Non-Classical at the 2012 Grammies .
`` This is really crazy for me , man , '' the dubstep king said , on accepting the award .
`` I made this song in my bedroom when I was living illegally in a warehouse in downtown L.A. I made that song with a blown speaker . ''
