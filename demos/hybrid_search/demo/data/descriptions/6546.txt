This moody track begins with a recording from Apollo 17 .
We hear the crackled voice of Captain Eugene Cernan , the last man to have walked on the moon , gasp : `` A bright object .
Rotating in rhythmic fashion .
Look back on the earth ... There 's something out there . ''
Daft Punk commented to French publication Le Nouvel Observateur : `` It is a voice that literally just space .
And it speaks for itself ... '' DJ Falcon told NME the story of the moment that they finished this song : `` When we came to finally listen to the finished track in the studio , '' he recalled , `` we could feel the intensity the noise was causing .
Right at the end of the track , the speakers in the studio blew out !
I 'm talking like one second left .
That 's the end of the album !
It was such a rock n ' roll vibe , like smashing your guitar at the end of the show .
The studio was f -- ed up , but we just smiled at each other and said , ` F -- k that ! '
We closed the door on the studio and went home . ''
The song was co-produced by French DJ and producer DJ Falcon , who also plays modular synthesizer on the track .
Falcon and one-half of Daft Punk , Thomas Bangalter , formed a house duo called Together that released two tracks in the early 2000s on Bangalter 's own label .
`` We Ride Tonight '' by Australian rock band , The Sherbs is sampled at the beginning of this track .
