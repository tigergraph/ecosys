This song from Country music group Lady Antebellum 's Christmas EP , A Merry Little Christmas was co-written by Tom Douglas , who also collaborated on the trio 's past singles `` I Run To You '' and `` Hello World . ''
In addition to this track , A Merry Little Christmas features the trio 's version of five holiday favorites , including a rendition of `` Silver Bells . ''
`` We recorded all of this in July , '' Haywood recalled to Billboard magazine , `` so it was a little bit peculiar being in the studio in the middle of July in Nashville , Tennessee , 100 degrees outside , sweating , and doing a Christmas record .
But we had a great time doing it .
We had the studio all decorated ... We brought everything we had from our houses and decorated and tried to get into the spirit .
It was a fun experience .
`` Lady Antebellum is n't the first artist that needed to artificially recreate a winter scene to get in the Christmas spirit .
Check out how Brenda Lee recorded her classic `` Rockin ' Around The Christmas Tree . ''
Lady A 's Dave Haywood told Billboard magazine that for this song , he and bandmates Hillary Scott and Charles Kelley , `` tried to take some of our Christmas memories , and some of the things we remember from the holiday season , and put them into a song .
It was definitely a new experience for us ; we 'd never written a Christmas song , really , before .
But it was a lot of fun trying to look at what we do and how we spend the holidays and take that feeling and put it into a song . ''
A Merry Little Christmas is sold exclusively through Target stores , in the US .
