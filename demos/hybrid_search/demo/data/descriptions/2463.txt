The title track of the tenth studio album by American Country music artist Trace Adkins was not penned by the singer but was written by Chris Wallin , Aaron Barker and Ira Dean with him in mind .
He explained : `` You know , I 've had several near death experiences that everybody knows about , and these guys know me very well , so they wrote the song for me . ''
The biographical tune took on a more significant meaning when two months before the album 's release , Adkins ' home in Brentwood , Tennessee burned down .
Said the singer : `` The title song could have been based on my life and it 's about narrow escapes and the grace that guides you through .
Obviously , now after the fire , Proud To Be Here takes on an even greater significance .
Once again , I 've been blessed and everyone is safe .
I do n't even want to think what could 've been had it started at 3am instead of 3pm ... ''
