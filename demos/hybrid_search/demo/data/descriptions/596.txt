This was the lead-off single to Country artist Jamey Johnson 's third major-label studio album , Guitar Song I & II .
The song was released to radio on July 13 , 2009 , and peaked at # 52 in September on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart .
The song takes a look at a man 's life journey , which has taken a number of twists and turns in finding his way on his intended route .
`` It 's about which way he went , and the repercussion from the next decision , until he gets darker and bleaker and is totally lost , '' Johnson explained to The Boot .
`` He starts putting two and two together on the way out and comes to the conclusion that everything is for the purpose of God and it 's all wrapped in the design of the yin and yang .
That 's what it is all about - you live your life for the purpose of God , that 's the conclusion of it all .
Yeah , you 're gon na make a bad decision somewhere and they 're gon na come back and haunt you .
That 's OK , that 's part of life , too .
That 's the message of this album . ''
