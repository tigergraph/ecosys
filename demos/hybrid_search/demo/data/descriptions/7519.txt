This heart-felt rocker is about a missive from a soldier telling his loved one at home to move on if he should not make it back alive .
Vocalist Ronnie Winter explained in publicity materials : `` My younger brother just got home from Iraq , where he was a chaplain 's assistant .
And he told me one of the hardest things he had to do was deal with soldiers who just returned from the battlefront only to find out their girlfriend or wife was leaving , which would be just devastating to them . ''
