This was the fourth single and title track from English alternative Rock band Elbow 's debut album .
It was their first ever UK Top 20 hit .
Singer Guy Garvey told Drowned in Sound about this song : `` We only added this after the album was finished , bizarrely .
Quite often when you 're in love you find yourself testing your partner in the early stages of a relationship ; telling them all the naff things about you , the dark stuff about you - almost testing how far their love goes -LRB- at least I used to do so -RRB- .
It was wonderful working with -LRB- producer -RRB- Ben Hillier , and this track , I think , is sonically one of the most interesting we did with him . ''
