Not meaning to sound cavalier or offhand about it , Gin Blossom Jesse Valenzuela confesses that sometimes he does n't even know when his music is used in films or commercials until he sees it .
So he was completely unaware that this song was used in the movie Drillbit Taylor .
He remembers the producers asking him to write an `` up-tempo song , '' and that they `` enjoyed it because it moves pretty good ; it made the scene work . ''
But he did n't know they 'd used it .
`` Sometimes you do n't even know , and you just get a notice .
`` The artists do n't have much control over it once they 've turned it over to their publisher .
`` Sometimes they 'll just do it , '' Jesse says .
`` Sometimes it just slips through .
Somebody might be supposed to make a phone call , but I 'm not that precious about it .
Business is different these days , '' he laughs .
`` I do n't know if there are any good deals . ''
