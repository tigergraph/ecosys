The SÃ¶derberg sisters ' icon Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes takes a verse on this jubilant , life-affirming track .
The two girls told The Sun about singing with their hero : `` Singing with Conor Oberst has been a dream of ours since we started out .
We are extremely honoured and happy he wanted to be a part of this record .
He wrote his own verse for the song , he has such a magic way with words and made it really personal .
Hearing him sing the verse for the first time in the studio was very special and a huge compliment .
Our first reaction was : ` It sounds like Bright Eyes ! '
Ha ha . ''
New York folk/country rock band The Felice Brothers also feature on this track .
They contributed a variety of instruments including accordion , fiddle and mariachi trumpets .
