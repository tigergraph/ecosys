After securing a recording deal with Def Jam , the British Hip-Hop group N-Dubz flew out to Los Angeles , California to record their third studio album .
Def Jam boss L.A. Reid has declared himself a big fan of the London band and lined up top American producers to helm the set .
They included this song 's knob twiddler , Salaam Remi , whose resume includes work with Amy Winehouse , Nas and Jazmine Sullivan .
However , once the trio had recorded the tracks , they took this song at its word , cold shouldering the esteemed helmsmen and kicking them out of the studio .
Dappy told The Daily Star : `` Me and Fazer do all the post-production on our records -- the arrangement , the beats , the mixing .
We take it from a demo to the finished product .
We could n't stand aside even when working with those big American guys .
In the end they said to us : ` You know what , you guys might as well sit at the desk and do it yourselves . '
That was great to hear . ''
