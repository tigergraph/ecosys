This is a humorous yarn about the difference between the sexes .
Brad Paisley explained to Great American Country : `` I just wanted to capture this struggle a little bit between men and women in a playful way , which is ` Why do n't you get a little cosmopolitan here and feminize up for me just a bit ? '
-LSB- laughs -RSB- We 're fighting that every step of the way , some of us guys , and ironically in talking to the radio guys , they say the majority of the calls for it come from women , and I think the same thing happened with ` I 'm Gon na Miss Her . '
These women want their men to hear it , and by golly , that is the best way to get a man to hear something is to play it for their significant other .
They 're gon na be forced to listen to it .
It 's got that nudge-your-partner-with-your-elbow factor to it . ''
