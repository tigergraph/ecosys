Valentine recalled to Ultimate-Guitar .
com : `` One day I was talking to Mickey Madden and it was like , ` Let 's just come up with a couple song titles ' and he came up with the titles ` Ladykiller ' and ` Fortune Teller .
He said , ` Those sound like good sounding names . '
We were on the road and I 'm always sort of tinkering around with riffs and ideas and track ideas in Logic Pro .
I looked at ` Ladykiller ' and I ended up sort of writing a song with first-draft lyrics and then played it and Adam was into it and he added to the lyrics and tweaked a couple of the melodies to suit more of where he would sing it . ''
