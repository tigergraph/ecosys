Lead singer Sonny Sandoval : `` The lyrical inspiration of ` Going In Blind ' came late the last night of our studio session in Knoxville .
We had finished one song and had a rough music sketch of another .
We thought we were finished and would be heading home early in the morning until one of those moments happened .
Our inspiration walked through the door .
A good friend and neighbor of our producer Travis Wyrick stopped by the studio , for what I have no idea .
I was on the phone at the time and she was probably there no more than a minute .
I think she said hello to the guys , smiled at me and then left .
I walked back into the studio and the guys were continuing a conversation we had a few days earlier .
Travis was telling us about his friends who had lost their child to a crime so evil I could n't even begin to explain .
That 's how it started ; none of us had an ` Explanation . '
All of us in the room were husbands , fathers , men of faith , and spiritual guys who overall believe in the ` Power of Good . '
At that moment , not one of us could come up with an explanation .
We were speechless and quiet .
How do you tell this woman that everything is going to be alright ?
How do I tell her God has everything in control and truly believe it myself ?
Telling her I understand would make me a liar !
Do n't get me wrong , I believe in God .
I believe in this faith that has saved my life and I would willingly lay my life down for what I believe is the truth .
Just do n't ask me to do the same for one of my babies .
I do n't think I could . ''
