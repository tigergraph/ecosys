Moore wrote this autobiographical song by a lake with his producer Jeremy Stover and his pal Jamie Paulin with whom he 'd previously collaborated with a few times on his first record .
Moore told WSOC radio : `` Everything in this song is true .
It talks about the first time I went on a major tour , the first time I played at Grand Ole Opry and so many other great memories .
This is one of those autobiographical songs like I had on the first album . ''
