This song features singer-songwriter Janelle Monáe , who Big Boi first came across when she moved from New York to Atlanta in the mid 2000s .
The OutKast star was the co-executive producer of Monáe 's debut album , The ArchAndroid and he also featured on her single , `` Tightrope . ''
Big Boi told MTV UK : `` I think what 's special about Janelle Monae is that she is a true artist from the heart you know .
I first signed her about 5 years ago , I saw her in an open mic night and she was singing an Anita Baker song , she had a voice like a songbird so I picked her up right from there and groomed her .
She has a whole crew , the Wonderland Arts Society and they have a vision . ''
