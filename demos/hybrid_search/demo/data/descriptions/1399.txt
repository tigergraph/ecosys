This is the opening track from English three-piece gothic rock band Esben & The Witch 's debut album , Violet Cries .
The song is about the medical condition Argyria , which is caused by excessive exposure to silver .
Daniel Copeman from the band explained to Spin magazine : `` We 're drawn to oddities .
Argyria is such an interesting disease because it 's born of human folly . ''
Copeman explained the band 's name in the same interview : '' ` Esben and the Witch ' is a Danish fairy tale we stumbled across .
We like the way -LSB- fables -RSB- were used as moral compasses . ''
