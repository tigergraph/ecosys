The genesis of this Chickenfoot III track was a 15-second recording of vocalist Sammy Hagar in an intense mood angrily playing three chords .
Guitarist Joe Satriani told MusicRadar.com : `` There was n't a lot to go on , a song written around A , G and E , but there was something about his attitude that was very unique .
Basically , I wrote the song around that . ''
The recording went well but when Satriani went to lay down overdubs , he found it hard to tell where the key signature was in the verses .
He recalled to MusicRadar.com : `` It was very strange .
I had a hard time finding my footing .
I was like , ` I 'm not into this . ' ''
The next day , -LRB- co-producer -RRB- Mike Fraser must have been reading my mind that it was bugging me , because he suggested we try again .
We ended up replacing the live guitar all the way through .
Then I did overdubs , and everything just clicked - it sounded fantastic . ''
