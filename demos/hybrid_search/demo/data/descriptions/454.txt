This features and was co-written by Lovefoxxx from the Brazilian electro-trash band CSS .
Frontman Bobby Gillespie told Uncut magazine February 2008 about this collaboration with the singer : `` Our voices sound great together .
There 's three verses I 've written , and we got her to write a verse of her own .
It 's a song about a destructive relationship .
That one 's not an up , happy song . ''
Gillespie explained to The Sun why they decided to team up with Lovefoxxx : `` We love the first CSS album and Lovefoxxx is a really great girl .
We asked her to sing on a track before we 'd even written it .
Her voice is so soulful and sexy . ''
Gillespie told The Sun July 11 , 2008 : `` It 's just a very honest song about relationships , about a f -- ked up love affair .
No matter how bad it is , you just go back for more .
I think all love affairs are f -- ked up . ''
