This is the title track of the American Experimental Rock band Dirty Projectors ' sixth album .
Frontman Dave Longstreth and his bandmates spent nearly 12 months recording and writing the set in an isolated house in the rural solitude of Delaware County , New York .
The album cover features Longstreth and love-interest/Dirty Projector Amber Coffman with another man near the property that they were recording at .
Longstreth told Pitchfork : `` That was our one neighbor .
His name is Gary .
He was just a really nice guy .
The longer we were there , the better we got to know him .
He would come down and just hang out for a while .
My brother took that photo .
I do n't remember it being taken , but afterwards we were looking through photos and I just liked it a lot . ''
Longstreth told Tonedeaf.com about this tune : `` I think this song could be about trying to figure out the functions of one 's intuitions in a world that 's fully mapped , '' he said .
`` What are the use of intuitions on a globe that 's totally circumscribed .
Also I 'm actually obsessed with the internet , so the album is in a lot of ways about the internet , about how it changes the way we think and write . ''
On September 20 , 1519 , Portuguese commander Ferdinand Magellan set sail with 5 ships and 250 men for the East Indies turning west rather than the usual east route .
Three years later one ship limped home with just 18 on board , the first people to have sailed round the world .
Magellan was not amongst them , having been killed in the Philippines .
