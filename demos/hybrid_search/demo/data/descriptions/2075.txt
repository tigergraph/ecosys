Sam Phillips is a huge fan of Jeff Bridges ' performance in The Big Lebowski , so she jumped at the chance to write a song for his turn as an aging , alcoholic singer in Crazy Heart , a film co-produced by her longtime collaborator and former husband T Bone Burnett .
She sought inspiration from '60s - era ballads to fit the pace of the slow-burning drama .
`` I was very proud to have a song in it , '' she told Magnet Magazine .
`` I would n't have called that one , I 've got ta tell you .
But T Bone fought hard for that .
He felt that -LSB- Maggie Gyllenhaal 's character 's -RSB- moment needed to be more tender and not like the rest of the score .
It was her moment , not his moment .
For that , it worked well . ''
T Bone also co-composed music for the film and won a Grammy , a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Original Song for `` The Weary Kind '' -LRB- along with Ryan Bingham -RRB- .
