After attempting to write some material for her ninth studio on a synthesiser , Chan Marshall , aka Cat Power , was not happy .
She had lyrics and a beat and notes , but no actual songs .
So the Atlanta born singer 's touring band , the Dirty Delta Blues , came to her house in Malibu and played along live to her skeleton demos .
They did this intermittently for five months , however this is the only track on Sun that came from the process .
Marshall recorded the Sun album after a difficult break up with her long-time boyfriend , the actor Giovanni Ribisi .
This song 's music video finds the singer sporting a shorter haircut than before , having cut her locks after their split .
The breezy piano jam finds Marshall singing about her visits to different places all over the world .
On her return home , Marshall is met by , `` Bitching , complaining when some people ai n't got nothing to eat . ''
Having experienced the poverty and hunger in such places as Calcutta , the song turns into a cry against apathy and self pity .
`` What are we doin ' .
We 're sittin ' on a ruin , '' she implores on the refrain .
Sun debuted at # 10 on the Billboard 200 album chart .
It was n't only Marshall 's highest placing to date , but also the first album released in Matador Records ' twenty-three year history to crack the Billboard 200 Top Ten .
