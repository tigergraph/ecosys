PWT 's vocalist and songwriter Tom Higgenson explained this song 's meaning to Alternative Press magazine : `` To me , this song is about that first time in your life when you look out into the sky at night and you realize how big the universe really is .
This in turn makes you realize how small you really are .
To this day , this thought still scares the s -- t out of me .
I could drive myself insane thinking about it .
We really have no idea what 's out there or the big answers to all the big questions .
The crazy thing is that we 'll never know . ''
