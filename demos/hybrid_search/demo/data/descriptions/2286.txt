Madonna wrote this with Patrick Leonard , who collaborated with her on several of her '80s hits .
The song is a Pop lullaby which displays Madonna 's maternal side .
It was written for Patrick Leonard 's daughter , Jessie .
The chorus of the song was used for the Trance track `` Dear Jessie '' by a German Eurodance project called Rollergirl .
It peaked at # 22 in the UK and was the semi-official anthem of Berlin 's Love Parade .
Madonna only appears in the music video as an animated fairy .
This was a hit in the UK , but it was not released as a single in the US .
