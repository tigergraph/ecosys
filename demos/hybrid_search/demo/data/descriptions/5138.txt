R&B / Soul singer/songwriter Melanie Fiona was born to Guyanese immigrant parents and grew up in a music-filled house in the inner city of Toronto .
Though Fiona had been writing her own songs for years , the introduction of songwriter Andrea Martin , whose written hits for En Vogue , Monica and SWV and the chance to tour with Kanye West , would prove seminal for her .
Fiona 's debut album , The Bridge , was released in the fall of 2009 .
The song was Fiona 's first entry in the Billboard Hot 100 .
On this haunting track co-written by Andrea Martin , Fiona ponders if she 's going insane as she pleads with a man whom she loves despite his treating her like dirt .
The song was inspired by an unhealthy relationship that Fiona experienced .
She told MTV News that she knew the track could be a vessel to express herself , so she poured her emotions into it .
Said Fiona : `` I knew people would feel it , and it 's just a great thing to know that I 'm not alone in what I go through . ''
