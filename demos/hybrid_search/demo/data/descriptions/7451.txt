American Rock singer Meat Loaf described his 12th studio album Hell In a Handbasket to Billboard magazine as , `` the most personal record I 've ever made . ''
He added : `` It 's about how I feel the world 's gone to hell in a handbasket .
It 's really the first record that I 've ever put out about how I feel about life and how I feel about what 's going on at the moment . ''
The LP was released September 30 , 2011 in Australia , followed by a release in February and March 2012 worldwide .
The phrase `` going to hell in a handbasket , '' meaning we 're on a course for disaster , originated from an old English phrase `` to go to heaven in a wheelbarrow . ''
The term was a euphemistic way of saying ` going to hell ' and its alternative forms of `` going to hell in a handcart , '' or `` handbasket '' originated in the US around the time of the Civil War .
This was released as the first physical and second digital single exclusively through iTunes Australia on August 26 , 2011 .
It was penned by the Country music songwriter Dave Berg whose Country hits include `` If You 're Going Through Hell -LRB- Before the Devil Even Knows -RRB- '' by Rodney Atkins and `` Moments '' by Emerson Drive .
