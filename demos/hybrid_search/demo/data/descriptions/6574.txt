After The Libertines split up , Carl Barat formed Dirty Pretty Things with The Libertines drummer Gary Powell , while Peter Doherty formed Babyshambles .
The beginning of the song is talking about the days in The Libertines .
They were the elite of the British scene and had high hopes in America , but soon after getting a touch of the limelight could n't perform in the States due to Doherty 's addictions .
The chorus is looking back on how they paid their dues , and how it was time to move on before the whole scene came crashing down .
