Passion Pit 's Michael Angelakos was asked to pen a song for the soundtrack of Twilight : Breaking Dawn - Part 2 .
This was the result and it plays when Bella wakes up from her transformation .
However , even though The Passion Pit frontman 's songwriting fully aligned with the movie , it was n't until after recording the song that the band were treated to a screening .
`` You write the song before seeing the film , they do n't allow you to see the film , so I wrote a song about my own experiences , and it just so happened to correlate , '' Angelakos told MTV News .
