This song is about friendship .
The lyrics , `` stand up f -- king tall , do n't let them see your back '' and `` Take my f -- king hand and never be afraid again '' are saying that there are people in the world who are out to get you , but if you have your friends with you then you 'll be alright .
Gerard Way has said that his favorite lyric from one of his own songs came from this one : `` How wrong we were to think that immortality was never dying . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bella - Fullerton , CA -RRB- When performing this live , Gerard Way often say something like : `` You probably came with your best friend or one of your best friends ... I want you to turn to that motherf -- ker , grab him by the throat and say , ` You 're my best f -- king friend , and I would die for you ! ' ''
-LRB- thanks , Rhiannon - Manchester , England , for above 2 -RRB-
