The song features a vocal contribution from Lou Reed .
Metric vocalist Emily Haines first met the former Velvet Underground frontman at a Neil Young tribute concert during Vancouver 's Winter Olympics .
It was Barenaked Ladies ' Kevin Hearn who introduced Haines to Reed .
`` I assumed he would just say , ` Oh , whatever , nice to meet you ' and instead he said , ` ah , Emily Haines , who would you rather be ?
The Beatles or the Rolling Stones ? ' ''
the Canadian singer recalled to Spinner , adding that she was shocked that the rock icon had just referenced Metric 's `` Gim me Sympathy '' song .
`` I was , ` Aw .
No fu -- ng way !
He knows my name .
Not only does he know my band - which I totally did n't expect - it was a total writer shout-out , which you know is such an important part to me .
`` The pair hit off instantly and Reed invited Haines to perform with him at ` Vivid Live , ' an event he and wife Laurie Anderson were curating at the Sydney Opera House in Australia .
Reed and Haines collaborated again in the summer of 2011 for a tribute to songwriter and children 's author Shel Silverstein in Central Park .
At the time , Metric were working on this song and were struggling with the line `` Wanderlust will carry us on ... '' `` When I sang it , or the guys sang it , it was like , ` what is this ... Glee ? ' ''
recalled Haines .
`` This is not working , but we needed this feeling expressed of just keep on keeping on .
I called Lou and he said yes . ''
Reed requested that their mics were set up facing each other and the pair sang the whole song together .
However , the final version only uses Reed on the chorus .
`` We thought it needed to be a moment , not stand out from the record , '' said Haines to Spinner .
`` At some point maybe we 'll release that version . ''
