This song was penned by LA 's Hillary Scott and James T. Slater back in 2010 and submitted for the band to record .
It turned out to be the perfect track to lead off Golden .
`` It 's definitely a place where I 've been in my life where you 're just really missing the person you love , '' Hillary Scott told USA Today .
`` Some of my biggest influences as a female vocalist are Bonnie Raitt and Trisha Yearwood , and I truly listened to this song and thought , ` How would Trisha Yearwood sing this song ? '
And I really put myself in the song .
I wanted to get that emotion out because it is such a relatable subject matter . ''
The song finds Hillary stepping outside the box when it came to her vocals .
According to her LA bandmate Dave Haywood , being pregnant while recording the album helped Hillary deliver some of her best vocals yet .
`` I personally thought Hillary sang the best she 's ever sang on this record , '' he told GAC .
`` There 's a lot more charisma , and I think there 's a lot of excitement .
Being pregnant has given her this new found excitement and empowerment knowing that she 's bringing a new child into this world very soon . ''
