This wry account of living next door to a bunch of up-to-no-good scroungers is based on an argument between frontman Dave McCabe and an unidentified debtor .
Many songs on You Can Do Anything have a similar accusatory tone and McCabe told Q magazine August 2008 that the album should have been called `` Scumbag . ''
He added : `` It 's fun to write about people you do n't like .
Make fun of them , make a living out of them .
If you piss me off I 'll get a song out of you . ''
