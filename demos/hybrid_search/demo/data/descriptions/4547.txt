Vocalist Matt Davies-Kreye told Noisecreep that this slam dance anthem makes a very poignant statement .
`` Technology is cool but it 's really starting to effect the way people interact with each other in the real world , '' he said before adding , `` LOL , FML , '' to emphasis his point .
Drummer Ryan Richards told Rock Sound magazine regarding this track : `` Something else we have n't done in a while is a tracks like ` Escape Artists ... ' , ` Novella ' or ` Hospitality ' that take you through a whole host of different riffs , sections and moods , bringing you out at the end of a song somewhere completely different from where you started .
This is one of my favourite tracks on the record . ''
