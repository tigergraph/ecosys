Nas closes his tenth studio album , Life Is Good , with this reminiscence of his turbulent marriage with R&B singer Kelis and the couple 's ugly divorce in 2009 .
`` We was friends , we had it all , '' he raps .
`` Reason that you do n't trust men , that was your daddy 's fault .
He in the grave , let it go , he no longer living . ''
The Life Is Good album cover shows Nas pondering the good life while sitting in a white suit , holding the green wedding dress worn by Kelis .
The dress was the only item Kelis left behind when she moved out of the home they once shared .
`` The cover is like an old blues musician talking about his life , '' Nas told MTV News about the striking image .
The song samples Guy 's 1988 R&B break-up track `` Goodbye Love . ''
