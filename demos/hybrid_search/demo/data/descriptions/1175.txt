This is the first single from Reincarnated , an album of reggae-flavored music by rapper Snoop Dogg under the pseudonym , `` Snoop Lion . ''
Diplo and Ariel Rechshaid produced the record , whilst Major Lazer served as executive producer .
This was not the first name change for the artist born Calvin Broadus , Jr. .
He was originally known as Snoop Doggy Dogg before dropping `` Doggy '' from his moniker in 1998 .
The song finds Snoop sing-rapping about the `` hypocrites '' of the world , with help from singer , Jovi Rockwell .
Born in Kingston , Jamaica to Cabaret Singer Winston Clarke and Fashionista and beautician Marva Bloomfield-Clarke , singer-songwriter Jovi Rockwell is no stranger to the recording studio .
She has released a number of singles in Jamaica and the US , which include the Caribbean and European hits `` Party On , '' and `` Dance Floor , '' featuring dancehall artist Zumjay plus the Major Lazer track `` Gunz Do n't Kill People Lazers do . ''
Speaking to reporters , Snoop stated that deep-down he has always been a Rastafarian , but became aware of this himself upon visiting priests in Jamaica .
It was , according Snoop , the goddess spirit Nyabinghi who gave Snoop his new moniker , upon his arrival on the island .
The name is derived from the Lion that appears on the Imperial Ethiopian flag and remains an honored symbol of Rastafarians .
`` I did n't want to be Snoop Dogg on a reggae track ... I wanted to bury Snoop Dogg and become Snoop Lion , but I did n't know that until I went to the temple and received the name Snoop Lion from the Nyabingi priest , '' explained Snoop .
`` From that moment on , I started to understand why I was there and was able to create something magical in this -LSB- Reincarnated -RSB- project ... something I have n't done before in my career . ''
