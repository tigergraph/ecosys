This is the title track of the eigth studio album by American rapper Lil Wayne .
The record was released digitally on September 27 , 2010 , the Cash Money Records star 's birthday , during his incarceration in jail on weapon possession charges .
The clip features the rapper performing in a dark room as his tattoos appear to glow in the dark .
`` The thing about this video , it was his concept to shoot the black light , 'cause that way the tats that he has , they glow in the dark .
That 's actually for real ; that 's not a camera trick or post-production , '' Rousseau told MTV News .
`` The tattoos that he has on him when you put the black light on him , they glow in the dark .
He came up with that idea .
So really , the rest of the video was a springboard on that . ''
Director David Rousseau shot the song 's music video before Wayne 's spell in prison .
It was one of a dozen clips that the duo shot before the rapper 's incarceration .
Rousseau told MTV News that when he sat down to work with all the material after Wayne turned himself in to a New York City prison , he just had to listen to the lyrics and portray the MC in an abstract sense , which includes contrasting shots of his writing process and flashes of money .
`` After listening to the track , he 's talking about just not being a human being , being totally different , is he an alien , '' the director explained .
`` So the idea grew from that .
It was n't that hard , because we already had a base of what the concept would be when we shot his performance earlier this year . ''
The I Am Not a Human Being album topped the Billboard 200 whilst Lil Wayne was still laid up in prison .
Weezy is not the first incarcerated rapper to achieve a # 1 album .
The late Tupac Shakur 's 1995 disc Me Against the World also reached the summit when he was residing in jail .
