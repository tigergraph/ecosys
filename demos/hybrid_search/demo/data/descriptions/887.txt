The origins of this song lay with a trip to a nightspot .
`` After a concert in Paris , we went to a strip club ; the promoter got on the mic and said , ` We have a special guest , Bruno Mars ! '
and then they played ` Just The Way You Are , ' Mars told Rolling Stone .
` That 's the worst song to hear in that environment , so I resolved to write a good one .
`` Resolved to write a more appropriate theme song for such an occasion in the future , Mars got together with Philadelphia producer Diplo -LRB- Chris Brown 's `` Look At Me Now '' -RRB- to come up with this song .
`` Diplo has all the sounds in his computer to make the club go wild , '' Mars said to Rolling Stone of the track .
`` We actually wrote that to be a strip-club anthem . ''
