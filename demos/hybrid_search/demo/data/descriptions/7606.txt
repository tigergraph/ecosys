It has been noted that Radio Wars has a more positive edge than Howling Bells ' self-titled debut album .
This song for instance , despite its dark sound , is lyrically upbeat .
Singer Juanita Stein explained to The Independent February 27 , 2009 : `` We wrote it very much in the mood of how we were feeling at the time , which was very optimistic and hopeful and on the whole note of trying to create something a little more insightful and futuristic than what we had done before , which felt very grafted , earthy and tangible . ''
