Both Elle Varner 's parents are in the music industry .
Her mother , singer Mikelyn Roderick was a backup vocalist for Barry White and her father Jimmy Varner is a songwriter , producer , and multi-instrumentalist , who has collaborated with Kool & the Gang , and Will Downing .
Its no surprise that Varner was singing as soon as she could speak , playing the flute at 6 and the piano at 9 .
The Los Angeles native earned a coveted spot in New York University 's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music , but her early success as a musician did n't make Varner any less shy when it came to a college crush .
`` It 's one of the saddest songs on the album , about not being able to say ` hello ' to a guy that I was in a class with for four months , '' she admitted to MTV News .
`` And to this day , I never said anything to him .
And it was kinda heartbreaking , like , ` Just say it ! '
but I ca n't . ''
