This is the fourth single from Canadian hard rock band Evans Blue 's self-titled third album .
Frontman Dan Chandler explained the song 's meaning to AntiMusic : '' ` Say It ' is a song about having someone in your life who feeds you false hope and trusting someone who seems to have good intentions , only to find out there 's a hidden agenda .
It 's about taking back the reins and regaining control of your life . '
I was the animal ' ... I pulled you along , and I want you to know how that feels . ''
Chandler explained the song 's music video , which was created by the band 's fans : `` There is empowerment in taking your life back from anyone who tries to control you , and the people in the video embrace this fearlessness .
We are so lucky to have such amazing fans , and any time we can make them shine ... we will ! ''
