The capital letters in the song 's title spell out ADAM , which is a subliminal message for Cook 's brother , Adam , whose struggle with brain cancer has been a source of much anguish for David .
The American Idol winner explained to Entertainment Weekly : `` A Daily AntheM '' is three years old .
I did n't originally write it with the intention of it being about Adam .
I just wanted to write something that had a John Lennon , ` War Is Over ' quality .
Then I was like , oh s -- , if you capitalize that letter and that letter and that letter , you 've capitalized my brother 's name . ''
This power ballad is the only track on Cook 's self-titled major release debut album , on which he is the sole credited writer .
