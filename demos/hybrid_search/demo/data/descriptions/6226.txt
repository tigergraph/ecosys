Shinedown drummer Barry Kerch told Bravewords.com how this song got onto the soundtrack for The Avengers movie : `` It was left over from the Amaryllis sessions , '' he explained .
`` They were looking for a song and we had a couple .
They liked that one so we went in the studio and re-tracked it , added some stuff and changed the arrangement a little bit for the soundtrack ; but it was definitely an idea already in place . ''
