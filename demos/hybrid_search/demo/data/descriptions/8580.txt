Country music singer Ronnie Dunn spent years playing bars and clubs before heading to Nashville and hooking up with Kix Brooks to form the successful duo Brooks & Dunn .
This track from his debut self-titled album was co-written with Craig Wiseman and describes his life and the sacrifices he 's made to pursue his dream .
`` It 's autobiographical .
I 've played all those bars in Oklahoma and Texas , '' Dunn noted to The Boot .
`` I 've torn down my amps and the sound system , drove to the gig , drove home .
I got home at sunup .
We did n't make any money .
We were n't doing it for money .
It would be great if we did .
Half the time we were just trying to survive the fight at the end of the night when we saw the bar tab , and seeing who would be coming up with the money to pay for that . ''
