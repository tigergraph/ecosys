Amy Lee originally wrote this ballad just for herself , but producer Nick Raskulinecz persuaded her to let the band record it for the Evanesence album .
She explained to MTV News : `` I was literally just writing it for me , to soothe my own feelings by expressing them .
And I just thought , ` Piano , vocals , I can record it by myself at my house , and that 'll be the track .
... It 'll be a B-side somewhere or something . '
-LSB- But -RSB- then ... as we were working on other songs -- focusing more on rock songs -- I kept listening to it for fun , because it was mine , and I sent it to Nick -LSB- Raskulinecz -RSB- and I was like , ' I want you to listen to this .
... The more I listen to it , the more I think it means something , ' '' she continued .
`` And he , instantly , was like , ` We have to do that song . '
And it was his idea to bring the band into it , and at first , I was totally like , ' I do n't get that . '
But once we did , it just blew the thing wide open , in a way I had never thought about before .
It 's perfect ; it 's meant to be the way it is . ''
The song describes the position Lee found herself in at the end of 2007 when , recently married to one-time psychiatrist Josh Hartzler and with two best-selling albums behind her , she 'd decided to take a hiatus from the band .
She explained to Kerrang !
magazine : `` I just wanted to be nested , be married and be normal and not have my life centered around myself and Evanescence .
My whole life had been centered around being ` the girl from Evanescence ' and all that entailed since high school . ''
