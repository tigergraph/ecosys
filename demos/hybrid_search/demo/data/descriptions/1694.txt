This is a poem read by the father of drummer Rob Rolfe .
Frontman Rou Reynolds explained to Kerrang !
May 2 , 2009 : `` We wanted a War of the Worlds type voiceover and he had the perfect voice for it .
It 's really low and menacing .
He talks like that all the time ! ''
Reynolds added that the grandfather of bassist Chris Batten `` recorded part of it , too .
To give a sense of global unity , we asked fans to submit recordings of them saying ` we must unite ' in different accents and languages .
It was great to hear everyone 's contributions . ''
