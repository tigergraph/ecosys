This song is about a man and his wife who run away while trying to hide from vampires .
Unfortunately , his wife gets bitten by a vampire , and though she says she loves him very much , he is forced to kill her before she becomes a vampire .
-LRB- thanks , Laura - Toronto , Canada -RRB- Monroeville is the town in Pennsylvania where the mall scenes from the movie Dawn Of The Dead were shot .
Lead singer Gerard Way said the song was inspired by the movie : `` The man and his love are hiding from the living dead , who are coming to kill them .
Since the town is surrounded by mountains , they can not get out .
The living dead attacks the woman , and she turns into one of them .
Though he loves her , he is faced with the difficult reality - he must take a gun to her in order to survive and ` End this direst . '
Because she loved him and he loved her , the decision to kill her made ` things harder at best . ' ''
-LRB- thanks , Ophelia - Jerusalem , Israel -RRB-
