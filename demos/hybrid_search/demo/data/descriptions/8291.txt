Rather fittingly given it 's subject matter of strikes and poverty , this song was first played by The Clash at the Brixton Miner 's Benefit shows in December 1984 , and remained in their live show for the unique Busking tour , where the band toured the country busking in parks and pubs with acoustic guitars and stayed overnight in wherever they could sleep that was n't a luxury hotel - usually a fan 's floor .
