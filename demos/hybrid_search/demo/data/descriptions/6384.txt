This was written by Blondie keyboard player Jimmy Destri , who when asked what this song was about replied : `` Desire .
Teenage desire because I have a teenage daughter and she 's pretty beautiful and I watch all these boys gawk at her .
I put myself in their shoes thinking about what I used to do with girls back then .
I was n't a very forward guy at all , I was like from afar and I 'd go home and write a poem about her - I was really a sad little bastard .
It sounds cute but you do n't get any attention that way .
So ` Maria ' is about desire and the whole idea of using the Ave Maria thing is a way of saying she 's on a pedestal , she 's almost holy .
It 's not a religious thing at all , I do n't believe in religion really . ''
-LRB- from the official Blondie website - thanks , Simon - welling , England -RRB- When this hit # 1 in the UK , Blondie became the first act to have # 1s in the UK in the '70s , '80s and '90s .
This was Blondie 's comeback song - their lead singer Debbie Harry was 53 when it was released .
The band re-formed in 1998 for a tour and album after breaking up in 1982 .
The new version of the band was made up of original members Chris Stein -LRB- guitar -RRB- and Deborah Harry -LRB- vocals -RRB- as well as former members Jimmy Destri -LRB- keyboards -RRB- and Clem Burke -LRB- drums -RRB- along with two new members .
The band was gone for about a generation , which meant there were a lot of new fans who were just discovering Blonde and hearing their earlier hits for the first time .
This may seem like a great Karaoke choice , but it 's more challenging to sing than many people think .
Says Debbie Harry , `` It has undone many a Karaoke singer .
And me . ''
