This is about a psychopath who is almost completely reformed , but still has some very insane thoughts .
The original version of this song was not a ballad , but a hard rock song , part of which you can hear in CKY The Documentary .
That version was n't released , because lead singer Deron Miller did n't think the demo it was on -LRB- The Lifeline Demo -RRB- was good enough .
This is a hidden track .
It starts at 19:37 on the song `` To All Of You . ''
-LRB- thanks , Mike D - DeSoto , MO , for above 2 -RRB-
