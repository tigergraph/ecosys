This is a track from the self-titled debut solo album by producer and TV on the Radio guitarist Dave Sitek , recorded under the guise of Maximum Balloon .
This song features Ambrosia Parsley .
Sitek told The Guardian : `` Ambrosia sang for this band called Shivaree , and she 's married to one of my best friends .
It 's always been in the back of my mind to use her on something because her voice just grips you .
It makes you feel like you 're inside of some crazy movie .
She can sing without any music and you 're like ` What the hell ? '
There was a lot of unmixing going on after I got the vocal tracks .
I was able to take all my s -- t out and just let her voice hang there .
That 's the sign of a great performance . ''
