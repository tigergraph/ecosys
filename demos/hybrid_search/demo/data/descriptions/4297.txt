After I came up with the ` Levels ' hook , I tried using the vocal over it , and it worked really well .
Then my manager landed an incredible deal with our label and did an amazing job getting publicity for the track .
To me , it 's one of the career changing tracks that I fell brought the whole AVICII brand to another level -- pun intended -LRB- Laughs -RRB- . ''

A friend of mine told me about it , and it stuck in my head .
I was going to make up a name for my MySpace page for the first time , and I just kind of went for it .
I tried a couple of other -LSB- names -RSB- before , but they were all taken -LRB- laughing -RRB- .
I kind of ended up with Avicii , and then I got really attached to it . ''
The song was a top ten hit throughout Europe and was especially successful in Avicii 's native Sweden and Norway topping the charts in both countries for multiple weeks .
