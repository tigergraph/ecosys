This is a track from the self-titled debut solo album from producer and TV on the Radio guitarist Dave Sitek , which he recorded under the name of Maximum Balloon .
The song features Little Dragon , an electronic music quartet based in Sweden who has also collaborated with Gorillaz .
Sitek told The Guardian : `` I 've been friends with Little Dragon since they toured with TV On the Radio .
They 're the sweetest people I know .
They came to stay with me in LA during a break from their last tour , and they started twisting this song around .
When Yukimi added her vocals it became this magical thing .
Like the rest of the sessions on this record , it was an unplanned event .
You know how when people start a band they 've usually designed their T-shirts before their first practice ?
I still have n't designed the Maximum Balloon T-shirt . ''
