This is the first single to be released from the Alternative Rock duo The Ting Tings second album , Sounds From Nowheresville .
The song was made available on December 27 , 2011 and was the duo 's first release since `` Hands '' in October 2010 .
The self-shot music video was made on De Martino 's iPhone in a dusty skateboarding bowl in Alicante , Spain .
The duo decided to title the album Sounds From Nowheresville to reflect how the music was conceived .
`` We spent so long on the road -- recording music and touring -- that the whole musical element of the album came from everywhere and nowhere , '' Ting Ting Jules de Martino explained to Spin magazine .
