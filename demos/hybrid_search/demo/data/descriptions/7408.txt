This semi-autobiographical cut pays tribute to Moore 's late ` Paw Paw ' grandpa who took him up into a deer stand when he was just four years old .
He penned the song with his producer Jeremy Stover and buddy Jamie Paulin .
Moore recalled the writing of the song on WSOC radio : `` I 'll never forget , my producer and I called my buddy and said , ` Hey bring a case of beer over here .
We want to write this song called ` Guns ' and he said , ` We ca n't do this . '
We said , ` Oh yes we can !
You can either sit here and drink beer or you can help us write it . '
We wrote it .
It 's become an anthem at our shows , kind of like ' I Could Kiss You Ass ' a few years back .
Someone told me a long time ago that as long as I 'm alive and breathing , you wo n't take my guns and that 's where the hook came from . ''
