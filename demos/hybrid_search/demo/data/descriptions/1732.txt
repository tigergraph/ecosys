The fourth single released by English singer-songwriter Olly Murs is a breezy , feel-good piece of pop , which was co-written by him with Martin Brammer and Adam Argyle .
Brammer was formerly a member of the UK blues rock trio , The Kane Gang , who are best known for their 1984 tune , `` The Closest Thing To Heaven . ''
He also co-wrote The Lighthouse Family 's 1996 hit , `` Lifted . ''
Argyle started off as a country performer and in 1999 he won the Best Newcomer award at the British Country Music Awards .
He then decided to concentrate on broadening his style of songwriting and has subsequently worked with Melanie C and Newton Faulkner amongst others .
The video sees Murs dressed in '70s attire singing to a female mannequin , which he 'd made out of papier-mache .
The clip was directed by Corin Hardy who discussed it with Promo News : `` For the fourth single they wanted to place Olly in a different position to the glossier X-Factor videos he 'd had previously .
I enjoyed the challenge of thinking of a way of doing a sweet and colourful piece to suit ` Busy ' while also bending the rules of your usual pop star video .
I 'd seen the brilliant Lars & The Real Girl as well as being a massive fan of American indie films -LRB- Wes Anderson 's , etc ... -RRB- .
I thought it would suit the tone of the video to mimic that strongly composed visual style mixed with quirky humour and emotion often found in these movies , and also to give Olly his own starring role .
I thought it was best if Olly actually created his ` perfect girl ' by his own arty hands and it was n't long before he was playing around with newspaper and wallpaper paste , really getting into character !
We shot over two intense days , keeping an intimate crew -- twenty of us all packed in the same room .
Olly really embraced the spirit of what we were going for and kept his energy up throughout to pull of the eccentric role in which he had to genuinely fall in love with a life-size papier-mache girl . ''
