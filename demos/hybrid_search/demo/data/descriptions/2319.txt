Drake closes Take Care with another gripe about fame , a theme that runs throughout much of the album .
`` I hate when people say they feel me , man , '' he spits .
This has a soulful Hip-Hop vibe , which according to Drake 's right-hand man Noah `` 40 '' Shebib was what attracted the Toronto MC to the track .
He explained to MTV News : `` It was a vibe that the Weeknd caught , and it was just so crazy that Drake wanted to rap on it -- as simply put as that . ''
The song was co-produced by Toronto-based R&B singer Abel Tesfaye , a.k.a. the Weeknd , who also provides vocals on the track .
Tesfaye also contributed to another Take Care cut , `` Crew Love . ''
Tesfaye recalled to Complex magazine : `` We were making the drum loop and ... oh , man , I had smoked I do n't know how much weed .
Even Drake , he came into that session and we were all smoked out .
It was terrible how much weed smoke was in that room .
I was surprised I could even hit a note .
I had sung this melody -- it was n't a hook , just an unfinished lyric .
And he liked it so much , he was like , `` I need to have this , man ... I know I 've already taken ` Shot For Me ' and ` Crew Love ' and this and that . ''
And me , I was hungry at that time .
I was like , ` Dude , take anything . '
At that point I was like , ` Hell , yeah . ' ''
