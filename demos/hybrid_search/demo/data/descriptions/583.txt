Co-written with keyboard player David Bryan , `` Stranger In This Town '' runs to 6 minutes 15 seconds .
In 1991 , when he appeared on the MTV programme Rockline with Martha Quinn to promote the then new album , Sambora said this was one of his favourite tracks off it , and that it was autobiographical .
Although it is a song in an entirely different vein , its theme is not dissimilar to Rory Gallagher 's `` Philby '' .
