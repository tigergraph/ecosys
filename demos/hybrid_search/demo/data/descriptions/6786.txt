This is a track from Dolby 's A Map of the Floating City project , which represents three distinct continents , each with its own musical flavor .
In our interview with Thomas Dolby , he said : '' ` Oceanea ' is about returning to my sort of spiritual home and the countryside that I live in , which is where my family were from originally .
And just a very deep , warm feeling of homecoming to move back there and set up shop in my lifeboat studio and start writing and recording.After living in California for 20-something years , I moved back to the UK , mainly because of the schools .
And I found moving back and moving out to the country , where I live on the east coast of England facing the North Sea in a tiny village - I found that move very calming to me creatively .
And especially after a few years away , it really made me focus on the inner voice of my music , without any distractions of trying to make music that will get played on the radio or will make a marketing guy happy or anything like that .
So all of that was out of the window , really , and I was just making music from the heart . ''
The female vocals were provided by Scottish singer Eddi Reader .
Some of you will remember her as the vocalist for acoustic pop band Fairground Attraction , who had a # 1 hit in the UK in 1988 with `` Perfect . ''
