This song continues a tradition begun on the title track of his 2008 solo album , Liverpool 8 , in which Ringo and the Eurhythmics Dave Stewart pen an autobiographical song about the former Beatle 's early life .
Starr explained to Billboard magazine that it part of a plan `` to do a mini-biography on every CD from now on .
It 's not like a book where you can write forever ; you sort of encapsulate certain moments of your life . ''
Ringo Starr said in a January , 2010 radio interview that he 's not knocking the legendary seaport town in this song - he 's just telling it like it is : `` I just has the words and the melody to ` the other side of Liverpool is cold and damp , the only way out drums , guitar , and an amp ' which was a saying we all had in those days .
And it was cold , and it was damp , and it is a port .
I have a plan now - whether it works out , I do n't know - to do a mini-biography on every CD from now on .
You can only pick Moments in your life when you 're doing it on a record .
It 's not like a book when you can write forever .
And you sort of encapsulate certain moments in your life , and that 's what I believe ` The Other Side Of Liverpool ' has done . ''
-LRB- thanks , DeeTheWriter - Saint Petersburg , Russia Federation -RRB- This track portrays Starr 's rocky upbringing in a lower-working-class household : `` It was a tough , violent neighborhood , '' Starr recalled to USA Today , `` If you fell over in the street as a kid , everyone in that street was your mother and would come out and look after you .
It 's like fantasy now .
But the thing I wrote this song for is that people believe I was born , joined The Beatles and then lived in a mansion . ''
