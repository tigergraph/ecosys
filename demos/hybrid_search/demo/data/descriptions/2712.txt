This track is a reaction to the murder in 2004 of Glasgow teenager Kriss Donald , who was abducted , stabbed thirteen times and then burnt alive .
Singer James Allan told Q magazine February 2008 : `` It happened 10 minutes from where we live .
It still haunts me .
I had to write a song from his mother 's point of view . ''
Allan told the Daily Mirror August 8 , 2008 that he was disturbed that this song has attracted unwanted ` support ' from right-wing extremists .
He explained : `` I think anybody with half a brain who reads the lyrics to the song will know exactly what it 's about .
If you are writing about this sort of stuff , there are always going to be people who will take it the wrong way . ''
Allan told The Sun August 15 , 2008 : `` The song came from seeing his mum in the paper and the parents of another murdered child .
It was sending me crazy because it was so heartbreaking .
You put yourself in the position .
What if it was me ?
What if it was my mum ?
I would never want my mum to go through what that woman was going through and I was just expressing that in the song .
It just came to me one day when I was playing Buddy Holly 's ` Love Is Strange . '
I was singing that and so my song has a similar melody .
I 'll probably get sued now because I wanted the same sound . ''
