Yeah , right , we all know where this cliché comes from , `` Born To Be Wild '' , right ?
As for all the other clichés in this song , how long have you got?Still , if you like your music loud , and especially if you like the sound of guitars , you might just like this .
Not the finest track Biff and the boys have ever produced , but this is also the title of a documentary which covers the band 's history .
Strictly for die hard Saxon fans .
