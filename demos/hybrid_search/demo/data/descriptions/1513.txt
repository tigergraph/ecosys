This song is about how money is spent on weapons and bombs for war when it could be spent on much better things .
People are starving , seriously ill , and need help and war is wrong and nothing good comes out of it .
It was released at a time when America was going through conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The lyrics were written by Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian .
Music by Daron Malakian .

-LRB- thanks , Ty - Boise , ID -RRB- Before the US invaded Iraq , there were massive worldwide protests .
The video was real footage of these protests , with people reciting the words to the song and voicing their opinions .
