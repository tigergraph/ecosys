Many people think that this song is simply about a guy who misses a girl , but the song is much more in depth .
The guy misses Emily enormously but it is impossible for him to see her .
Emily commits suicide and leaves him behind .
He is waiting until they meet again in heaven .
This is especially evident in the line `` Thunderstorms could never stop me '' - now it is the closest they ever are .
