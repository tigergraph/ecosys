Pizzorno told the New Musical Express January 17 , 2009 : `` The timing is strange and the vocals are in and out because it 's a rant .
I wanted that Beastie Boys , Clash feel , giving Tom a song to sing where he can rant , because that 's when he 's at his most genius . ''
Pizzorno said to the NME June 13 , 2009 : `` I knew the moment I wrote the riff it was going to be massive . ''
he added : `` I like that Tom and my voices swap over . ''
The song pays tribute to the late Dark Knight actor Heath Ledger through the line `` Joker , see you on the other side . ''
Vocalist Tom Meighan explained to The Sun May 22 , 2009 : `` When Heath Ledger died , Serge had just written Vlad The Impaler so he added that line to pay respect . ''
Guitarist Sergio Pizzorno added : `` He 'd just finished this amazing film and his life was over .
I identified with him .
I know so many people who get off their heads and then ca n't sleep so they have a sleeping pill .
I thought ` That could have been anyone I know .
It 's just such a waste of a great man 's life . ''
Vlad Tepes , or Vlad the Impaler , was a ruler of Wallachia -LRB- present-day southern Romania -RRB- in the 15th century .
He became notorious for the extremely cruel punishments that he dealt to his enemies , his favorite form of torture being impaling his victims , then mocking them .
In the English speaking world , Vlad the Impaler is perhaps best known for being the inspiration for Dracula .
A video was made for this song starring English comedian Noel Fielding as a vampire slayer .
Pizzorno told the NME : `` Doing the video with Noel Fielding was outrageous , him running around a country house impaling people . ''
