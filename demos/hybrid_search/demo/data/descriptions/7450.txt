In a Sun TV interview , KT Tunstall explained that this is a special song to her , and she 's always loved the phrase `` Hopeless Romantic . ''
She says that this song is about `` people around you saying ` tsk tsk tsk what are you doing ?
Get a job you 're wasting your time . ' ''
She also says that there is something honorable about being hopeless if it 's done for a good reason .
