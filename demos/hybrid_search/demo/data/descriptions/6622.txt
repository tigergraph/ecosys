Duran Duran is rarely forthcoming about the meanings behind their songs , but this appears to be about the evil part of you taking over and consuming your body .
The snake represents that other side of you .
-LRB- thanks , Jenny - Toronto , Canada -RRB- This was inspired by Jim Morrison 's lyrics for The Doors ' albums .
Simon Le Bon told Spinner : `` There are times when I get into books and things and some of that comes up on the record or I 'll get into a certain artist .
An obvious example of that is ` Union of That Snake ' and ` Hungry Like The Wolf ' are very much related to Jim Morrison and his lyrical ideas . ''
In 1984 , Duran Duran released The Book Of Words , which contained lyrics to their songs .
In the book , Simon Le Bon explained , `` Borderline might be one between the conscious and subconscious minds . ''
He admitted in later interviews that it was a reference to tantric sex .
