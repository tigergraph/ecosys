The introduction to this song features the chorus chanted over sparse drum beats .
In an interview with Chart Attack , drummer Ben Horowitz was asked if it was a spontaneous thing that came up in the studio .
He replied : `` That part was definitely written before we went into the studio .
That was actually the most controversial part on the record .
Some people did n't like it , some people did like it .
We were n't sure if it was going to stay in or not.In the end , we decided to keep it .
My reasoning was the fact that , if you like it or you hate it you ca n't ignore it .
At the very least , you ca n't not know it 's there .
I 'm still not even sure if I like it or not , but I do like the fact that people either really love it or really hate it , so it 's kind of fun . ''
