`` Wadsyaname '' was produced by newcomer Neff-U , who built the track around the piano line for K-Ci and JoJo 's 1998 hit `` All My Life . ''
This did disappointedly chart-wise except for in New Zealand where it peaked at # 4 .
Nelly said in USA Today , `` We were just in the studio playing around with the keys , and he played that and I remembered that that was the jam .
I asked him to see if he could put a drumbeat with it , and we had it .
It 's really a song that 's more for the ladies .
`` In the same interview he explained the reason behind the title of the album : `` When I decided to call it Brass Knuckles , it was n't about anything violent .
It was just a symbolic way of saying how hard I think it is going to hit .
It is a different market , but if you have fans , they will still come out and support you . ''
This appears as a bonus track on the Japanese and Australian editions of the album .
