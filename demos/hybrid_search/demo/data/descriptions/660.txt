This song finds the atheist Frank Turner , singing about how rock and roll , with its legends and apostles , is for many a surrogate for religion .
He explained to Drankin ' and Smokin ' : `` I do n't try to deny that there 's a religious impulse in people and I certainly understand that .
I 'm not even necessarily talking about the desire to kind of come up with a salve for the essential blackness of impending death and non-existence .
There 's also the need to be joyous and celebrate .
And I guess , yeah , rock and roll fills that hole in my life .
The other thing too about that song is that , when I was on tour in China actually , and the rock and roll scene over there is very young and new .
The kids involved in it were so excited about rock and roll in and of itself ; about playing three chords and playing loud and fast and shouting and jumping up and down -- all the things that are essential to rock and roll and all the things that we take for granted because we live in a culture that is so saturated with rock and roll .
It was so exciting to see people be so stoked about the whole thing , basically .
It really made me think that it does n't hurt to remind ourselves , every now and again , how lucky we are to have this incredible cultural thing in our lives . ''
Turner performed the song during the warm up for the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony .
Thanks to downloads , it debuted the UK singles chart at # 40 in the week after the event , Turner 's first ever top 40 entry .
