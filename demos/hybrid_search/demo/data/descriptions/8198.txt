This was arguably ABBA 's most influential track as its emphasis on electronics made it a very important record for Techno musicians in the post Disco era .
Madonna 's `` Hung Up '' is based on this track , and Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson are included in its songwriting credits .
The only previous time ABBA had allowed one of their songs to be sampled was in 1996 when they allowed the Fugees to sample the bass and synthesizer of 1977 's `` The Name Of The Game '' for their 1996 hit `` Rumble in the Jungle . ''
Madonna begged the ABBA songwriters for permission to sample this song and sent an emissary to Stockholm telling them how much she liked their music .
This reached # 1 in Belgium , Finland , France , Ireland and Switzerland .
