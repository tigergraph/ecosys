The song is about a boy-girl relationship .
Bon Jovi explained : `` It 's a girl , which I watched from a distance without any possibility to do something .
She is in a way like a pinball - reflects a lot of guys , very beautiful and smart but thinks it would be happier if more trusted .
This song is something like a diary of the observer and I 'm just the fly on the wall of what looks . ''
