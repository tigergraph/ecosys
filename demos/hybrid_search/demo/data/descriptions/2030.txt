Oberst told the Independent newspaper July 18,2008 that this song is `` about infidelity , and acceptance of the way things are . ''
Oberst told MTV News the story behind this song : `` We were on the bus one day and a friend of ours that travels with us and works for the band kind of came out from the back of the bus and said that first line : ` Saw an eagle on a pole ... I think it was an eagle . '
And then this guy Simon Joyner , who is a great songwriter from Omaha and one of my great friends , he was on tour with us and sitting there and he was like , ` You know , that 's a great name for a song . '
We kind of had a contest where he wrote a song with that first line , and -LSB- then -RSB- I did , and a couple of our other friends .
We kind of all played them for each other .
Simon 's is better than mine , but it is a good line to start a song . ''
