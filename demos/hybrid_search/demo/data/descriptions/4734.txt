Lambert previewed this Four The Record track during her September 8 , 2011 performance at the Hulman Center on the Indiana State University campus .
`` The reason I love this song is because it 's about how sometimes when you get your heart broken , you kinda go a little bit crazy , '' she confessed .
`` You drink too much , you smoke too much , you cut your hair ... you find a rebound .
Sometimes your mama , if she 's like my mama , has to slap you around and say , ` Straighten up girl ! ' ''
Lambert nearly did n't get to cut this tune .
She knew Kacey Musgraves from her days back in Texas , and they used to write together a lot .
The pair went their separate ways , but Musgraves reappeared on Lambert 's radar after her appearances on Nashville Star .
The country star explained .
`` I do n't think I was supposed to be pitched the song , but her sister actually shot some pictures at mine and Blake 's wedding , and she was there , too .
At our rehearsal dinner , I went over and asked her , I was like , ` Are you gon na cut this song , or can I have it ? '
And she was like , ` I 'll think about it for a couple of days . '
`` Musgraves granted her wish ... with some strings attached .
`` She e-mailed me , and said , ` You can have it , if I can sing harmony , ' '' said Lambert .
`` So that 's her singin ' the harmonies on it - and actually , Kacey Musgraves , she has a new single out called ` Merry Go ` Round ' so she 's doin ' great on her own now , but I had to actually beg for this song , and so I 'm thankful that she gave it to me 'cause I love ` Mama 's Broken Heart . ' ''
This Brandy Clark , Shane McAnally and Kasey Musgraves penned song finds Lambert re-visiting the unhinged-by-a-broken-heart territory she previously sung of on cuts like `` Kerosene '' and `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend . ''
`` I have that angst naturally , '' she told Billboard magazine .
`` I always lean toward a sad song or an angry song more than a love song , but now that I am happy and in love and married , I can have the perspective of both . ''
The recording of Four The Record came right on the heels of Lambert 's short honeymoon after marrying Blake Shelton .
She went into the studio just a week after her wedding .
Her goal was to have everything lined up and have the songs picked out for the album before the nuptials .
It was a close run thing as it was at Lambert 's rehearsal dinner that she persuaded Musgraves to allow her to cut this song , without which she felt she could n't make the album .
