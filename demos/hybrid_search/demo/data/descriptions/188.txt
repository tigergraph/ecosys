This is the title track of American pop punk band Good Charlotte 's fifth studio album .
Guitarist Benji Madden explained to Spin magazine why they named the record Cardiology .
Said Medden : `` Cardiology is the study of the heart , and that 's what we spend our lives doing - trying to figure our hearts out .
Not just romantically , but with our family , friends , and every emotion we have in our lives .
All of the new songs - whether it 's the most heartfelt or the funniest party track - are all tied to our emotions . ''
Benji Madden explained to Spin how he hooked up with Diaz .
`` He 's my favorite artist in the world .
He does religion-based pop-surrealism .
A lot of people approach him to design album covers , but he has n't done one in over 10 years .
I blindly e-mailed him at the `` info '' address on his website .
I told him that I was in a dark place during our last record , but that in the last two years I fell in love with music all over again .
He came down and listened to some rough mixes and agreed to do it .
It 's my dream come true . ''
Latino artist Daniel Martin Diaz designed and painted the album cover .
The Mexican-American previously created the cover of Christian rock band P.O.D. 's 2003 album Payable on Death .
Some fans felt the cover was negatively symbolic and many Christian music stores refused to carry the record .
