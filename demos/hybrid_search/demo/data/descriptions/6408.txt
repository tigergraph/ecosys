Ariana told MTV News that this song is so emotional and personal to her , that she sometimes has a hard time singing live .
`` I almost cried last night when I was singing it onstage , 'cause it 's about something that 's so special to me when I hear it .
It strikes a personal chord , '' she said . ''
` Honeymoon Avenue ' is about knowing you are at the end of a relationship and wishing it could not be the end and go back to the beginning and start over . ''
The song is Ariana 's favorite track on Yours Truly .
She explained to Rolling Stone : `` It strikes a chord with me .
It 's been a part of my life for three years now and it 's come full circle .
In the beginning , it sounded like an upbeat , Motown pop song and I was like ` This song is really sad and it means a lot to me so we need to make it sound like the lyrical content . '
Then we made it sound like what the song 's about .
It 's even more special to me now .
It gives me this weird , bittersweet feeling that almost makes me want to cry . ''
The song was one of five on Yours Truly to be produced by The Rascals , who comprise Ariana 's former Victorious co-star Leon Thomas and his partner Chris Tines .
`` We got a 20-piece orchestra to lay some strings .
At that moment , I 'm going to be real , I felt like a boss , '' Thomas recalled to MTV News .
`` Producing something and then having all those people working so hard , it was crazy . ''
Thomas added that he looked to songwriter Diane Warren -LRB- Cher 's `` If I Could Turn Back Time , '' Aerosmith 's `` I Do n't Want to Miss a Thing '' -RRB- for inspiration .
`` It needed to feel like a really big '90s record , almost like Diane Warren ... just how big those records felt , we wanted that , '' he said .
Leon Thomas ' voice can also be heard at the beginning of the song .
`` The first voice you hear is my dear friend Leon Thomas , '' tweeted Ariana .
`` From years of TV to making my first album together ! ''
