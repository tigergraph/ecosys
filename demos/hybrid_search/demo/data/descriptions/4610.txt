Josh Ritter admitted to MSN CA that this song , which is jammed with words and syllables , is `` a really hard one to sing . ''
He added : `` For me , it 's harder to limit than it is to explode .
When you 've really got a pocket , and you 've got something you want to say , and you just have a few lines .
Then to fill up the rest is much easier , especially when you 've got a rage about something . ''
Ritter wrote the song `` in the studio one morning . ''
He explained : `` I woke early and I just had it .
I had a lot of swirling lines , but then it just kind of happened .
There was lot of writing happening .
I was starting to get the idea of the record .
That really came together magically . ''
