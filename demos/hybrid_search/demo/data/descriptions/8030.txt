It was Toby Keith 's songwriting partner , Bobby Pinson , who had the original idea of ` You 're gone but I bet I have n't seen the last of you , ' for this song .
Keith recalled regarding penning the heartbreaking narrative : `` This was one of those where we got halfway through and were n't sure if we were going to be able to finish it .
Then , all of a sudden , one of us opened a door and finished the song . ''
The song features harmonies sung by Mica Roberts who is an artist signed to Keith 's label Show Dog Nashville .
She accompanied Keith on the song `` Let 's Get Trashed '' from the soundtrack to the 2008 film Beer for My Horses and has been a backing singer in his band for a number of years .
