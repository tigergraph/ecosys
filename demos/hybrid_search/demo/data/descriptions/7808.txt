This fun-fuelled dance track starts as a message that co-vocalist Ana Matronic is leaving on someone 's phone .
She proceeds to describe her night out at a club , which gets shut down by the cops so she is forced to move the party home .
The song became an online hit after Anne Hathaway admitted she was a fan of `` Kiki 's '' on Late Show With David Letterman .
So what is a ` kiki ' ?
`` The term ` kiki ' is a drag queen term , '' Matronic explained to Spinner , `` and it 's used in the drag community in America to describe a good time .
You can have a kiki on the phone with your friend .
It also means gossip .
Or you might hear a conversation where somebody says , ` Did you go to the club last night ? '
and you 're like , ` Wow , girl , you should have been there .
It was a kiki . '
It would mean that your friends were all there and you had a good time . ''
