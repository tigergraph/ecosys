Minaj teams up with her `` Super Bass '' co-writer Ester Dean on this dance track about a bad-boy lover .
`` I did n't know that bad could look so good , you are the type of bad that feels so good , '' she sings .
Minaj had two features on Madonna 's MDNA set and this track 's title is an amalgam of `` I 'm a Sinner '' and `` Beautiful Killer '' from the deluxe version of that album .
The song was co-produced by British knob-twiddler Alex Da Kid -LRB- Eminem and Rihanna 's `` Love The Way You Lie '' -RRB- and Moroccan/Swedish producer and frequent Lady Gaga collaborator RedOne , who was also the man behind the desk on Minaj 's hit single , `` Starships . ''
