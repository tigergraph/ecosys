This is a difficult song for Bugg to sing .
He explained in a video track by track : ' I actually play it a key higher live , on the record it is a key lower , but still it 's a difficult song to sing , I 've sung it many times .
When you sing that song its very hard on the voice so I went to the studio knowing I 'm going to have to nail it first take , after that it just gets weaker and weaker and weaker .
I played it live with the band but I realized the mix in my headphones , I could n't hear the band and they just played along with me and we had it in one take .
I looked across at the producer , I thought ` we 've got it , ' we were quite lucky really . ''
