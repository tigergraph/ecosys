The first single from British alternative dance band Friendly Fires ' second album Pala finds singer Ed Macfarlane voicing his frustration at the comments made by aging hipsters on old videos where they go on and on and on about their golden partying past .
He told the NME : `` I was looking at YouTube videos of raves from the '80s , and they looked amazing , like a fantasy world .
So it 's a homage to the past but also a celebration of the present . ''
