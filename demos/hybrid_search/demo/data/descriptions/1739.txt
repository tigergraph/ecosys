James Morrison was inconsolable after his alcoholic father died of heart failure in August 2010 .
He told The Daily Mail : `` A month before , I said : ` If you do n't deal with this soon you are going to die . '
When he died , I became depressed , crying in bed all day , feeling numb . ''
Out of his grief , came this song , where Morrison compares his feelings to the sky -- `` full of tears waiting to cry . ''
The song title refers to the period of mourning for Morrison after losing his father .
He told The Sun : `` It had never been the easiest of relationships but we 'd worked at it .
When he died I just stopped writing and did n't do anything for six weeks .
I wanted to close myself off from the world and deal with my pain . ''
