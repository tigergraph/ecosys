Children Of The Corn is the name of a Stephen King novel that was made into a horror movie in 1984 .
KoRn considers the `` Children of the KoRn '' to be their fans .
They wrote it about how the parents of the fans of KoRn and Ice Cube and really any loud band do n't like the music their children listen to .
They just consider it noise and think they 're just yelling and cursing all the time and do n't know what it 's really about .
