This biting , largely spoken-word poetry slam finds frontman Jon Foreman coming close to rapping .
He told Christianity Today magazine : `` I 've always loved the Dylan songs and Johnny Cash tunes that where spoken word is an integral part of the song , and so this is my first venture into that . ''
The song is an angry examination of a media-mad nation .
Said Foreman to Christianity Today : `` The beauty of song is that you can tell the truth , and sometimes you get fed up with the way it is .
If you 're well adjusted to injustice , then it 's time to become maladjusted .
One of the beautiful things about art of any kind is that it 's a great outlet to vent these frustrations and maybe try and change things for the better.In the old days , whether it was Dylan or Lennon or Joan Baez , they called them protest songs .
Is this the same type of thing today ?
Bob Dylan did n't like the term ` protest songs . '
But yeah , there is something to be said for standing up and saying , ` This is n't correct .
This is n't right .
This is n't true .
This is n't beautiful .
This is n't honoring to your fellow man . '
And I do n't have any other way to express these things in an eloquent way , so it 's going to come out in song . ''
