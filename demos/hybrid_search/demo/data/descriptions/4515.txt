In Neil Peart 's book Ghost Rider : Travels on the Healing Road , he wrote that his brother Danny read the poem Funeral Blues -LRB- W. H. Auden -RRB- at his daughter Selenas funeral , the poem contains the lines `` The stars are not wanted now : put out every one ; Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun ; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood , For nothing now can ever come to any good . ''
This inspired the lines in this song `` All the stars fade from the night The oceans drain away . ''
