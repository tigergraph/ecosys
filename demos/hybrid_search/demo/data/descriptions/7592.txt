This song was written by Rascal Flatts lead singer Gary LeVox along with the Nashville songwriters Neil Thrasher and Michael Dulaney .
Nail did n't have the experience he sings about in the song , but saw it as an idealized way to relive his youth .
He explained to Great American Country : `` The first time I heard ` Summer Job Days , ' I just knew I had to cut it .
Growing up I never went on a lot of vacations .
I was actually 21 before I saw the ocean for the first time . ''
