This is the second single from Florida pop/punk band Mayday Parade 's second album , Anywhere But Here .
Frontman Derek Sanders told MTV News that the song `` was written about the summer that I turned 17 , when I was going down to St. Pete to see this girl down there , and doing all the stuff that kids do . ''
Sanders admitted that the negative reaction from some of Mayday 's fans , who called the video `` embarrassing '' and `` pointlessly explicit '' had taken he his bandmates by surprise .
`` The negative reaction , it bothers me .
I hate to see people say they 've lost respect for us or that they 're no longer going to be fans of our band , but luckily , that 's just one extreme of all the feedback we got , '' he said .
`` A lot of our fans also loved it .
But I understand why some people were upset .
We 're not saying the things in the video are good , not by any means .
And I do agree I would n't want my 13-year-old cousin to see it . ''
The song 's music video , which follows four kids on a debauched road trip , has provoked controversy with its three-plus minutes of drugs , violence , nudity and sex .
The clip has been banned from YouTube , and angered a portion of Mayday 's fan base .
Sanders told MTV News : `` When we first started thinking about the video , we knew what we did n't want to do , because we 've done the video where we 're just playing somewhere , and , to be honest , a lot of other bands have done that too .
So when we were approached by -LSB- director Josh Mond -RSB- and saw the idea he had , we knew it was a risk , but we wanted to do it .
And then , when we saw the first cut of the video , we were like , ` Wow , that was extreme . ' ''
