Thomas Rhett grew up in the music industry by means of his singer-songwriter father Rhett Akins .
Whilst studying business and communications at Lipscomb University in Nashville , Rhett formed a cover band and began playing frat parties and other gigs they could get .
His dad persuaded him to take the stage one night at a Nashville showcase , and EMI Music 's Ben Vaughn , the same publisher who had signed his father many years earlier , offered Rhett a publishing deal .
Within a few months , he 'd succeeded in landing the cut `` I Ai n't Ready To Quit '' on Jason Aldean 's 2010 album My Kinda Party and the following year Rhett signed a recording contract with Big Machine Records ' Valory Music Group division .
This playful tune , which Rhett penned with Lee Thomas Miller and Chris Stapleton , was released as his debut single .
Rhett penned this song during a writing session with Chris Stapleton and Lee Miller .
He recalled : `` We started the session looking for titles that we had on our phones .
Lee brought out this title and we starting writing this song and it just came out and turned into this sort of quick , funny song about doing something with your hands . ''
Rhett 's frantic on stage persona inspired the song .
He explained to The Boot : `` I turn into a kind of crazy person onstage .
I do n't know where it comes from .
I 'm a very laid-back human being , but when I get out there , I just get way too pumped up and I do n't know what to do with my hands sometimes except to wave them in the air or point at somebody ! ''
