This is a collaboration between Train vocalist Pat Monahan and the Norwegian songwriting duo Espionage .
The trio also penned Train 's smash hit `` Hey Soul Sister . ''
Monahan told The Huffington Post the inspiration for the lyrics came from a New York building .
He recalled : `` I was looking out at this building in Manhattan in Times Square , and I was listening to this track they made for me , and as I heard it , it was really inspiring .
It felt like a hurricane in the South that was a symbol for a relationship , and the work it takes to rebuild it is enormous , but it 's worth it .
I said , ` Dudes , I know everything about this song , I just sang every word of it to myself while listening to your music . '
These dudes were from Norway , and they were like , ` What did you think about , I would like to know ? '
and I just said , ` Man , this song is called ` Brick By Brick ' and this is what it sounds like . ' ''
