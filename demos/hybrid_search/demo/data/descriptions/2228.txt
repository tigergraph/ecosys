This song was done very quickly , after the album was already finished .
Kravitz originally intended it to be a B-Side only , but a friend who heard that song finally convinced him to call his record company , stop the whole procedure and added the song to the album .
-LRB- thanks , Martin - Rostock , Germany -RRB- The lyrics are very simple , which makes the song great for sports montages and movie scenes where there is no deep meaning trying to be conveyed .
Kravitz feels good songwriting can be done with very basic ideas .
This won a Grammy in 1998 for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance .
Kravitz won the same award the next 2 years for `` American Woman '' and `` Again . ''
Kravitz told Guitar World magazine that sometimes the sound of a guitar or amp you pick up makes you play a certain type of riff , and when he picked up the guitar that time , the sound made him play the riff for this song .
-LRB- thanks , Josh - Atlanta , GA -RRB-
