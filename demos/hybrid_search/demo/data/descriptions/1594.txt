RHCP guitarist Josh Klinghoffer explained in a video interview with Los Angeles radio station KROQ that the creation of the song started with Flea 's bass line : '' -LSB- We were -RSB- crouched on our knees in Flea 's basement .
He started -LSB- mouths bass riff -RSB- and I just started doing those wacky medley chords .
We were taking hikes up Los Feliz by Griffith Park , talking about how excited we would be if we saw a band start -LSB- mouths same bass riff -RSB- and just break out into the biggest disco party you could imagine .
And we did . ''
The Chili Peppers have turned down most approaches for their songs to be used in commercials .
However they agreed to the appearance of `` Monarchy of Roses '' in a 2011 Japanese car ad for the Nissan Elgrand .
This was originally written and recorded under the working title , `` Disco Sabbath . ''
The -LRB- mostly -RRB- black-and-white video was directed by Marc Klasfeld , who was also responsible for the visual for `` The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie . ''
It was inspired by the artwork of Raymond Pettibon , who is name checked in the lyrics -LRB- `` The calicos of Pettibon where cultures come to clash . '' -RRB- .
The LA artist has contributed album art for bands like Black Flag , Foo Fighters and Sonic Youth and is the brother of Black Flag guitarist , Greg Ginn .
Initially , Pettibon was a bass player in his brother 's group when it was known by the name Panic .
