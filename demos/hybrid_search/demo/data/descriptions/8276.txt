Gaga explained in a Facebook post : `` Government Hooker was inspired by Marilyn Monroe + political mistresses .
I wonder what they were privy to + what they affected . ''
The pervy robot voices are courtesy of one of Gaga 's inner circle .
`` The guy that 's actually talking , that 's her security guard , '' White Shadow revealed to MTV News .
`` We were sitting there thinking how to make a computerized voice , so we were like , ` Let 's get Pete in here . '
He 's got a super-thick Dutch accent , and he 's trying to read off paper .
It was insane , and he just talks like that .
That 's what it 's like working with Gaga .
It 's like a f -- ing supernova .
When she walks into a room , things explode . ''
Boston-based radio , mixtape & Club DJ Clinton Sparks co-wrote this song .
His previous credits include Pitbull 's 2010 track , `` Vida 23 . ''
The song 's producer , DJ White Shadow , recalled to MTV News that this thumping , sexy track came together in Las Vegas .
`` We were in this studio in Vegas , and I was playing some hip-hop stuff -LSB- for Gaga 's label boss Vince Herbert -RSB- , and I ran across this -LSB- old beat I had made -RSB- , and we were talking about faster songs , so I sped it up and I played it for Vince . ''
He was like , ` Whoa . '
She walked in , and I played it for her and -LSB- Born This Way producer -RSB- Fernando -LSB- Garibay -RSB- .
She laid it out in two seconds .
She sang over the melody and tuned it up and put the chorus in .
She finished it super quick . ''
Gaga penned the lyrics right on the spot .
She explained them to UK music magazine the NME : `` The humor is that a machine in the song tells me what to do and I happily do it as long as I get f -- ed .
It relates to how our government f -- us over , but it makes fun of the plastic popstar - I 'll do anything as long as you f -- me and pay me . ''
