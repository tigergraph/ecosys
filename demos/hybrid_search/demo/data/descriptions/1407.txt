McEntire explained to Great American Country : `` This woman has a meltdown and she is just putting sheets on the bed and winds up in a bunch of dirty clothes on the floor , crying her eyes out .
She checks into a cheap motel and lets it all out , crying in the bathtub .
It was just as simple as picking up the kids and she 's back in life again .
She just needed to go away and take time for herself .
Eight hours later , they 're sitting around table eating chicken and laughing .
It 's eight crazy hours and the story of love . ''
Country/bluegrass singer-songwriter Leslie Satcher and country session guitarist and songwriter Darrell Scott -LRB- `` Long Time Gone '' -RRB- wrote this song , which was originally recorded by Shelly Fairchild on her 2005 debut album Ride .
Initially , McEntire was unsure whether to record it .
She explained to Great American Country : `` This is a song I was on the fence about because it was so deep that I just did n't know how to take it .
And so I let Autumn McEntire Sizemore , my niece , listen to it .
She started crying and said , ` You 've got to record this song . '
I let more people listen to it and they were like , ` Oh my gosh ! '
It did n't hit me as hard as it did a lot of other people .
I guess I have n't had to get away .
I think my music is my release .
Whenever I am menopausal or whatever , I can release things in my music when I sing .
That is my therapy .
It touched so many people that I recorded it .
When I sang it live it choked me up so much that I could n't get through it . ''
