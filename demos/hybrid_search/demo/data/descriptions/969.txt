This was written by Summer together with Greg Kurstin , who has also co-written UK Top 10 singles for Kylie Minogue -LRB- `` Wow '' -RRB- and Sophie Ellis-Bextor -LRB- `` Catch You . '' -RRB-
Among the other artists he has penned songs for are Pink and Lily Allen .
The other co-writer is former child actress and singer-songwriter Danielle Brisebois , who starred in the original Broadway cast of Annie .
Her rendition of `` Hard Knock Life '' was later sampled by Jay-Z on his `` Hard Knock Life -LRB- Ghetto Anthem -RRB- . ''
Brisebois was later a member of the American rock band New Radicals and co-wrote Natasha Bedingfield 's hit single `` Unwritten . ''
She also co-wrote the title track `` Crayons '' and `` Drivin ' Down Brazil '' for Summer 's album .
This was one of three # 1 songs from Summer 's Crayons album on the Hot Dance Club Play chart .
The other two were `` I 'm a Fire '' and `` Fame -LRB- The Game -RRB- . ''
Summer explained in her official press release that this stadium tub-thumper was originally called `` The Player 's Anthem . ''
She added : `` It 's the whole concept of being a player in life , coupled with the idea of being a player on an actual field , the whole thing , dealing with the pain and doing things even though you are afraid .
Even though you 're afraid of something and your knees are knocking , you get up and do it because a lot depends on it .
Players get taken off to the sidelines and bandaged and thrown back in the game because it depends on them to win the game .
We 're all ` players . '
It goes back to Shakespeare : ` All the world 's a stage , and all the men and women merely players . ' ''
