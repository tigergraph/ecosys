This Country influenced track is from LP1 , the fifth studio album by English soul singer-songwriter Joss Stone .
The record was recorded in Nashville at Country star Martina McBride 's Blackbird Studio .
Produced and co-written by Eurythmics co-founder Dave Stewart , Stone , McBride and the Warren Brothers are also credited writers of the song .
Martina McBride explained to The Boot how she ended up with a writing credit for the British Pop/Soul singer .
`` Joss was recording in the studio with Dave Stewart , who we 've come to know really well over the past year and a half , '' she recalled .
`` I was writing with the Warren Brothers in the writer 's room in another building .
They started playing me this idea they had for me , but I said I did n't think it would work for me , but it sounds just like Joss Stone who is recording down in the studio .
We worked on it for an hour and half and then took it over to Dave and Joss and tailored it to her , to what she wanted to say .
The five of us wrote it together , and it 's on her album .
It 's really cool . ''
