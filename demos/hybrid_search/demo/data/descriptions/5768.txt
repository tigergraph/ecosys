This is the first official single from American R&B artist Trey Songz 's third studio album , Ready .
The song finds Songz putting a request out for a female companion .
He told the online station Pyro Radio : `` I think I need someone who understands what 's going on .
That understands that its not all peaches and cream .
When I say ' I need a girl ' , I 'm informing all my fans of the stresses I am going through and just showing a bit of vulnerability .
I 'm out here working hard , and sometimes I go back to my hotel room alone .
I -LRB- sic -RRB- watching by myself .
After all the screaming fans , I fall back and have nothing to hold that I love and care for .
It 's very different having a woman , having sex with her and going to another city , then having a woman who you can talk to and understands your plight and what you 're talking about .
That 's just telling them that I am human and I do have needs . ''
This song was helmed by the Norwegian-born , NYC-based production duo Stargate .
They had previously worked on Songz 's Grammy-nominated `` Ca n't Help But Wait . ''
Celebrated director Benny Boom directed the music video .
It was shot on location in Malibu , California .
