This love letter to Aaron Lewis ' home state is a track from the Staind frontman 's debut solo country EP , Town Line .
He explained : `` I live in the sticks of Massachusetts .
I wrote the song sitting on the front steps of my house .
In the spring , the peepers get so loud outside .
When they come out , they bring on the night .
It 's chilling and familiar , and I 've heard that sound my whole life .
That 's how I know I 'm home . ''
Town Line was helmed by James Stroud .
The legendary Country producer told Artist Direct about Lewis 's recording of this song : `` He sang about Massachusetts , but to me , he 's singing about Texas and Louisiana where I grew up .
The sentiment is the same .
It 's that emotional connection with where you grew up , what you 're all about , and where you came from .
When I listen to ` Massachusetts , ' that melody is haunting .
The way he sets up that chorus takes you where he came from , but it also takes me where I came from .
If I could sing like that , I would say the very same thing , except where I grew up .
Everybody who hears it can relate because they all come from somewhere that gives them the same sentiment he has , sings , and writes about . ''
