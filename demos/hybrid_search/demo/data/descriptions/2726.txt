This ballad with an Irish Folk flavor features a variety of instruments including Trumpets , Trombones , Violins , Violas and Cellos .
The use of strings on this and several other Amaryllis tracks was down to producer Rob Cavallo .
Drummer Barry Kerch recalled to Alternative Addiction : `` He thought that one of the songs was missing something , he did n't know what for a while and then he shouted ` f -- k !
I know , it needs strings ' and then it was strings on this song , that song the other song .
On other songs it was horns , or a synthesizer on others .
We had a thirty seven piece orchestra on this record and one song had a fifteen piece horn section .
Why ?
well because why not .
It worked , it 's fun and it 's experimental . ''
This song is about being comfortable in your own skin .
Kerch explained to Alternative Addiction : `` It 's autobiographical about Brent -LRB- Smith , vocals -RRB- saying hey , I 'm really not alright , I 'm a bit crazy but I 'm alright with it . ''
