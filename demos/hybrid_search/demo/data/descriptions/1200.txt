Guitarist Chris Foreman , who wrote the music for this , in Uncut magazine March 2008 : '' -LRB- Co-producer -RRB- Clive Langer thought it was a great idea to get Judd Lander in to play the harmonica on ` Yesterday 's Men ' - he 'd just been a big hit on ` Karma Chameleon . '
Lander was all right , but not on my song .
I fought and fought not to have him ! ''
This was the first single to be released from Mad Not Mad , the band 's only album not to feature founding member Mike Barson , who had left the group the year before .
Frontman Suggs recalled to Uncut magazine January 2013 : `` The band was formed in Mike 's bedroom , and it was obvious -LRB- after he left -RRB- that the magic was going to evaporate a smidge .
We manfully ploughed on , but really we should have knocked it on the head .
Just listen to the records and you can almost hear the split coming .
Unfortunately , we were the last ones to hear it .
` Yesterday 's Men ' was a sort of epitaph , but we were n't conscious of that . ''
