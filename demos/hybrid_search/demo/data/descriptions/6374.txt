Jewel said concerning this song on her website : `` I wrote this a while ago , and am glad it 's finally getting a spot .
It 's sure enough a country song , but has an aggressively articulate blunt yet poetic take on the classic ` I 'm leaving your no good ass ' theme .
The first line is ` shut up , sweetheart , there 's something I need you to hear : I can no longer love the same thing I fear . ' ''
