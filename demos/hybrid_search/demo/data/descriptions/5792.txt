This was inspired by a dream that Lambchop mainman Kurt Wagner had about sharing a drink with Martin Luther King Jr. .
Wagner explained to The Village Voice why he decided to make it into a song : `` Well , I think maybe what I was fascinated about more than anything was the fact that when you have a dream there 's a very short amount of time that you 're able to remember the details of it .
And it dissipates .
The longer you 're awake the more fractured and kind of difficult it becomes to remember it .
And that became more fascinating to me than the actual dream .
I was like , ` Wow .
Why is that ?
What do I remember ? '
You know , mixing in the moment of waking up and other things that actually were n't about the dream but the experience of the dream .
So , you know , if I include that into it then it becomes a little mystical , dreamy thing . ''
