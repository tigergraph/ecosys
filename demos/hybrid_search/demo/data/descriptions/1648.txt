This Pop-Rock ode to not worrying about the future and having a good time was written by Ke $ ha .
The TiK ToK singer told MTV News that for this song , she took her formula for writing party songs and applied it to Miley 's tween audience .
Said Ke $ ha : `` Writing for Miley was fun 'cause I think she 's funny .
I met her and I liked her vibe , so I was like , ` OK , I 'll write , like , a party song for a younger crowd . '
And that was fun just because I like her . ''
When Ke $ ha was a struggling musician trying to make ends meet , she earned some bucks penning tunes for other artists , including `` This Love '' for The Veronicas .
However , the paychecks for her creative efforts were often tiny amounts .
She told Seventeen magazine , `` It was like $ 1.63 cents for a song I wrote - I think for Miley Cyrus .
It was an embarrassingly tiny amount .
But I never cashed it and it 's on a bulletin board in my house . ''
