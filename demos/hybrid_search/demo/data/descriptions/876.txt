This song combines the subjects of Mars and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse mentioned in the Book of Revelations in The Bible .
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse appear in chapter 6 v 2-8 .
The four horses represent God 's judgment of people 's sin and rebellion , and are a foretaste of the final judgment to come .
The four horsemen are traditionally named pestilence , war , famine and death .
This song , like much of Black Holes and Revelations , is inspired by corrupt political leaders .
Matthew Bellamy says its not about any specific leader , but all leaders .
Evidence of this is shown in the lyrics , such as `` I 'll show you a ` god ' who falls asleep on the job , '' referring to leaders who treat themselves like God because they have power .

In the January 2007 issue of Q magazine , Matt Bellamy said : `` I 'd definitely be up for a trip to Mars .
I 'd love to record an album at zero gravity .
Or at least go up there and do a vocal take .
The area of Cydonia is very interesting .
There are parts of it that resemble abandoned civilizations . ''
