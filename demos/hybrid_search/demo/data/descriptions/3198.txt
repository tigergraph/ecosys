This was the first track to be made available from Manchester indie rock band The Courteeners ' second studio album , Falcon .
Produced by Ed Buller -LRB- Pulp , Suede -RRB- , the track was made available on December 7 , 2009 as a free download , as well as on vinyl .
Falcon was recorded with Ed Buller over two months in Belgium .
Frontman Liam Finn admitted to The Daily Mirror December 11 , 2009 : `` When we did the first album we were just chancing it .
We could n't even play our instruments and were just mucking around .
The musicianship is better now and the songwriting is more serious .
At first , Ed and I were in a comfort zone but then it got more tense .
We did n't always see eye to eye and it made the record better .
Then we did the Leeds and Reading Festival right in the middle of it .
We had three or four days off which came just at the right time .
It was quite an intense experience , but the record 's come out amazingly so we 're all really buzzing from it .
I 've never really had problems producing material of good quality . ''
Cross My Heart And Hope To Fly is also the title of a BBC radio play about recovering from loss by Sarah Daniels , which was first broadcast in 2002 .
It is not known if Finn took the song 's name from it , or separately came up with the same pun on the well known phrase , `` Cross My Heart And Hope To Die . ''
