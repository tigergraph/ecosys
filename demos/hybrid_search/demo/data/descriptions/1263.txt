This song features Anthony Raneri from the New York rockers Bayside singing at the end with vocalist Shane Told .
The Silverstein frontman explained the collaboration in an interview with Alter The Press !
: `` We finished writing the song and we recorded a demo of it and I sang his part and afterwards we were thinking about some guest appearances for the new record .
I thought about that song and I thought his voice would fit so perfectly in that one spot .
It 's actually kind of cool because on the deluxe edition of our CD we still have the demo of it , so people will be to hear how I sang it versus how he sang it .
I think it 's just cool for fans who care about that stuff to see the process from the 1 minute demo to the final finished product . ''
So , what is a Texas Mickey ?
Told explained to Alter the Press !
: `` A Texas Mickey is what we call a bottle of booze in a 3 liter bottle , it 's essentially a giant bottle of alcohol so that 's where the title of the song came from . ''
