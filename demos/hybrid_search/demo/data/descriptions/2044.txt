Depeche Mode vocalist Dave Gahan is a former alcoholic and now chooses not to drink any booze at all .
He told Mojo magazine : `` I was out Christmas Eve , a nice restaurant , everyone drinking .
I thought , ` Why ca n't I just have a glass of wine ? '
But I do n't anymore , because even one glass opens a whole Pandora 's box .
My mind immediately thinks , I can go much higher .
That 's what ` Should Be Higher ' is about - that line , ` The lies are more attractive than the truth . '
I still draw on that stuff when I 'm singing and performing , to dig my way out of trouble . ''
