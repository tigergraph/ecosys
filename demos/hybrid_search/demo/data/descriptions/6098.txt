Decamping to a country house in Devon , The Horrors hoped to recreate the atmosphere of The Rolling Stones ' Exile On Main Street , which was recorded at Villa Nellcote , a place Keith Richards rented in France .
They largely failed , this 8:39 extended piece being the only survivor from those sessions .
Bassist Rhys Webb told Mojo magazine : `` We missed being in the city , we felt stuck in the middle of nowhere , with just the five of us , not able to see our friends and bounce ideas around . ''
Cowan recorded the sound of seagulls for this track on Whitechapel High Street in East London .
Synth player Tom Cowan told NME : `` This one was quite the mammoth task .
Rhys was dead set on the perfect sound for the main melody and drove me half mad as I systematically tried every synth in the room to no avail .
When we realized one would n't cut it we had to find the best combination of two , and also the best way of combining them , which meant repeating the whole process again . ''
