Richard Carpenter on richardandkarencarpenter.com : `` The oldies were enjoying a resurgence in popularity during the early '70s , much to Karen 's and my delight .
I thought it would be nice to write a song about this , and use the piece to bookend the oldies medley we were planning to record for the second side of our first album release for 1973 , Now and Then .
The resulting ` Yesterday Once More ' became our eighth domestic gold single , and one of our biggest hits worldwide . ''
The house featured on the cover of the Now and Then album was bought by Karen and Richard Carpenter for their parents in 1970 , with the earnings from their breakthrough hit '' -LRB- They Long to Be -RRB- Close to You . ''
Fans of the Carpenters refer to this relatively modest 5-bedroom house in suburban Downey , California , as their Graceland .
It was in a specially constructed annex at the Carpenters ' ` Graceland , ' that the siblings recorded their songs .
It was also here that tragedy struck , when in 1983 , the anorexic Karen collapsed and died .
