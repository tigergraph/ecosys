The second single from Casey James 's self-titled debut album was penned by Nashville songwriters Lee Thomas Miller , Tom Shapiro and Neil Thrasher .
The season nine American Idol alumni told The Boot that the first time he heard the demo , he loved everything about it .
`` The song really jumped out at me , '' he said .
`` Even the way that the song is presented .
The title of the track , the syncopation of lyrics and lyrics themselves - everything about it is very standout .
Plus the idea of the song is so relatable .
Who has n't been in the situation where their pride has gotten them in trouble ?
Maybe it 's a case where they do n't want to break down and lose that pride to make a situation right .
The whole thing is just great and I love it . ''
The song 's music video was shot in Nashville .
It is not a literal interpretation of the lyrics , instead there are symbolic things happening throughout .
`` Normally , a song like this would have the guy getting in his truck right away to go after the girl , and the song would play out on camera , '' James told The Boot .
`` This is not like that ... this video delves into the reason for the song .
It shows the relationship between the couple , their good and bad time .
You also see the breakup , and her packing and leaving .
Then it shows the anguish and torment of the guy who knows he made a mistake but is trying to overcome his pride so he can go after her . ''
