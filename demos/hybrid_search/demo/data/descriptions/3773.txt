Josh Groban penned this song with American record producer and songwriter Lester Mendez , who has also worked with Shakira , Santana and Nelly Furtado .
He told Billboard magazine the track was initially written for his 2010 Illuminations album but `` it just was n't the right situation . ''
Producer Rob Cavallo -LRB- Green Day , Goo Goo Dolls -RRB- did the string arrangement on this and other tracks .
Groban said at a listening party at the Sunset Towers in West Hollywood .
`` We took three of our favorite string players and let them jam for an hour -LRB- on a each song -RRB- .
We 'd take their improvising and then add 20 players to what they did . ''
Regarding the song 's meaning , Groban explained to Billboard it is about `` being in a relationship where you realize that you 're doing all the jumping around and need to be a little more zen about letting the right thing come to you . ''
Groban told Billboard magazine : `` I liked it because it was romantic and it was hopeful , but it was n't about a perfect situation .
It was actually about heartbreak and the grey area . ''
