Frontman Alan Donohoe told the Independent newspaper May 9 , 2008 about this song : '' ` We Are All Animals ' is about the scientific reduction of human soul into DNA .
I studied biology .
I think we gave the demo to our manager and asked him if he understood .
I was pleased when he said no - it 's quite good to have some ambiguity in lyrics .
What it actually means is the scientific reduction to genetics with the lyrics : the ` four letters ' are the four bases in DNA - A , G , T and C. I did get something out of three years ' studying biology - a song . ''
