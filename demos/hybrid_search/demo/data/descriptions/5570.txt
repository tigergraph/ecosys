This song finds Furtado singing about the artist 's self-indulgent habit of self-sabotage .
She explained to Artist Direct : '' ` Enemy ' is very much about self-destruction .
I almost detailed the process of self-destructing as an artist or tearing yourself apart in order to put yourself back together again , but it 's near the end of the record and I do n't really feel that way anymore .
Much of the process , I did n't feel that way , but I thought it was important to go a little bit backwards . ''
The cut was produced and arranged by Salaam Remi , who has also worked with Amy Winehouse , Nas and Jazmine Sullivan .
Furtado told Artist Direct : `` That was one of the first tracks I wrote with Salaam Remi .
It 's interesting , and I decided to put it on the album because I really believe in dark and light going together .
You always have to honor the dark side to somewhat .
I put the song there because it was one of the first songs for the album .
Salaam ended up doing three or four tracks total , and they 're some of my favorites . ''
