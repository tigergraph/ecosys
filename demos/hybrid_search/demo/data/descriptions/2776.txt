This song is based around a sample from Lou Reed 's `` Walk On The Wild Side . ''
Typical of A Tribe Called Quest 's laid-back style , they rap about how they love what they do using clever rhymes and cultural references .
To `` Kick It '' means to hang out and have fun .
The line , `` Mr. Dinkins wo n't you please be my mayor ? ''
is a reference to David Dinkins , the first black mayor of New York City .
Dinkins took office in 1990 and had the position until 1993 when he lost to Rudy Giuliani .
A Tribe Called Quest used a slightly different version of the song for the music video .
The beat in the video is dubbed the `` Spirit Mix '' as it uses additional samples .
In the clip , the group is seen literally kicking the word `` It '' through film sets , construction sites , and alleys around New York City .
The Swedish pop singer Lykke Li has been known to close her live shows with a cover of this song .
In a 2011 interview with Hip Hop DX , A Tribe Called Quest rapper Phife Dawg explained that the group has never received royalties from this song because of the Lou Reed sample .
Apparently Reed has earned money from the track and though Dawg is thankful he let his group use `` Walk on the Wild Side , '' he 's disappointed that Reed has n't bothered to offer to spread the wealth .
The reoccurring line `` Err , you can ... '' was sampled from a children 's TV show in the UK called SuperTed .
The line comes from a character named Spotty , voiced by actor John Pertwee of Dr. Who fame .
The actor Sacha Baron Cohen made fun of `` Can I Kick It ? ''
in his sitcom Da Ali G Show .
As a similar beat played , Cohen would rap as Ali G , changing the line to `` Can I nick it ? ''
