The opening track of Outlaws Like Me , the second studio album by Country music artist Justin Moore , is a tune he 's been playing since he arrived in Nashville in 2002 .
The album 's producer Jeremy Stover penned the song along with Kris Bergsnes and Rick Giles .
In an interview with the radio station WSOC , Moore explained : `` It 's a song that everybody knows at the shows and they sing it back to us even though it has n't been on an album yet .
I just thought this time we have to put this song out there for everybody so I 'm glad it made it on an album . ''
