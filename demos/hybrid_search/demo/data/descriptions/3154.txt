The Cover Drive quartet collaborated with Miami-based Reggae producer Supa Dups on this cut .
Lead singer Amanda Reifer told The Sun : `` This song is about that place you reach when you love someone but it 's not quite working out .
You know when you feel you ca n't go on if the person is not a part of your life ?
It 's not a cool place but great inspiration for a song . ''
