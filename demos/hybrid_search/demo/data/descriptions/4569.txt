This Liam Gallagher song is described by his brother Noel as `` a kind of lost-and-found story . ''
This is one of three songs that Liam Gallagher wrote for the album .
He also contributed `` I 'm Outta Time '' and `` Ai n't Got Nothin ' . ''
Noel Gallagher told the story of how this song came to be on the album to Mojo magazine August 2008 : `` We 'd not started recording , but we 'd started gathering together tunes that had a certain feel to them .
I was doing the Electric Proms with The Coral , who 'd recorded their album at my studio , and it turns out they 'd come across a hard drive in the Pro Tools that said New Oasis Stuff , and they 'd had a sneaky listen .
So -LRB- Coral Singer -RRB- James Skelly , a bit sheepish , asks me , ` Are you gon na do that tune Soldier On ? '
Now I do n't remember it , Gem does n't remember it , Liam certainly does n't remember it , but the other lads in The Coral are , ` You 've got ta record this tune , it 's f -- ing boss ! '
So I ransack this hard drive , ca n't find a track called Soldier On .
So we get to Abbey Road and we 're chatting away , and Andy Bell goes , ` Soldier on ?
Brilliant !
I 've got a CD of it in my bag . '
Turns out he recorded it with Liam , but Liam still does n't remember it .
` Well , ' says Andy , ` you were pretty f -- ing pissed .
` So we stick it on .
Like all Liam 's songs it 's got one verse and one chorus just repeated , but it 's ended up being the last track on the album .
It reminds me of a guy walking through sand , carrying a big block on his back , and it just goes on for ages .
It goes quite dubby at the end , and I play melodica on it , in the reverb chamber that The Beatles used ! ''
Noel Gallagher described this to Q magazine October 2008 as , `` A metaphor for ones-day-to-day existence . ''
