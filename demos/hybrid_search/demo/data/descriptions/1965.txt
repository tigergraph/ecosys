This was released as the fifth single from Play .
Moby recalled to Rolling Stone `` It almost did n't make it on the record .
I had some friends over and I was playing them songs off the record and they thought it was too weird .
I could n't get a good mix of it .
This guy in England , 1 Giant Leap , he mixed that song and did a really great job so I was able to include it on the record . ''
The song samples a 1937 recording by American folklorist Alan Lomax of Vera Hall 's `` Trouble So Hard . ''
Vera Hall was a 1930s country blues singer and her recorded output was largely preserved via field recordings made by Lomax .
Moby first came across this song on the Lomax collection Alabama : From Lullabies to Blues .
The Christina Ricci starring promo for this song won the 2000 MTV Europe Music Award for Best Video .
