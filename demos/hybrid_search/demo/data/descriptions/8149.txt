She explained to Christianity Today : `` It 's from living in Texas for the past 13 years .
It 's certainly not a part of my upbringing ; I mean , I grew up in Maine -- not exactly a hotbed of Hispanic culture .
Michael Ramos , who has produced me and played in my band for a long time , gets the credit for the Hispanic influence in my music .
He introduced ` Virgen de Guadalupe ' to me .
It 's such a lovely , tender hymn . ''
