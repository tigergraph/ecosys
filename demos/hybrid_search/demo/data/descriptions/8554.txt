Steel Magnolia is the Country duo of Joshua Scott Jones and Meghan Linsey , who rose to prominence after winning the CMT show Can You Duet ? .
`` Last Night Again '' was the third single from their debut album .
In our interview with Joshua Scott Jones , he told us the story behind this song .
Said Jones : `` We wrote that with Hillary Lindsey who wrote -LRB- Carrie Underwood 's -RRB- ` Jesus , Take The Wheel , ' and has had a bunch of huge , smash hits .
She 's a real cool girl , she 's just really laid back .
We knew that we had to write fill-up songs to put on the record and we went over there one afternoon and sat down with her .
And she was just cool .
It was like being at your buddy 's house .
So we sat on her floor and had a couple of beers and we wrote that song .
It was a little bit of a fantasy thing , kind of like a love at first sight -- it 's a hook-up song .
What I always say when we play that live , I say , ` Everybody , this is a hook-up song .
For those of you that have n't hooked up , your parents have .
So do n't worry about it . '
That 's really the story behind that song .
It 's just a sexy , flirtatious , fun song that I think that most people can probably relate to . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Greystone Communications and filmed in a Nashville bowling alley .
Meghan admitted in an interview with The Boot that she 's proud of the fact that she bowled a strike while wearing heels .
