Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant was raised Catholic and the lyrics reflect his unfavorable view of the church .
This causes a lot of controversy , but got the group a lot of attention and helped make this a huge hit in the UK .
Tennant wrote the lyrics to get back at some of his teachers at his former school , St. Cuthberts .
The teachers said some harsh things about him when the song was released .
