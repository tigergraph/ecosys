Frontman Cormac Neeson explained to Kerrang !
February 21 , 2009 , that on this tune , `` I 'm singing about a girl I know that went to a bar one night and got her drink spiked by one of those date rape drugs .
Luckily enough , she got away unscathed .
People who do that are f -- king scum of the earth .
I 'm actually singing through the eyes of that dude , which gives the song a bit of a twist as well .
I even got to have a blast on the harmonica . ''
