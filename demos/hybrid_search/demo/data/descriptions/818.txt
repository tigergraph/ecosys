Neko Case told American Songwriter magazine that this eerie a cappella cut recounts an exchange that she overheard while waiting for a bus in Hawaii : `` The song is a verbatim conversation between a mother and daughter and it was really heartbreaking , '' she said .
`` And I still think about that kid every day .
I just wanted to feel that kid .
Then again , at the same time , when her mother yelled that at her she just kept singing her little song and I thought that was kind of awesome , but I also knew that that kid was going to pay for it later , too , because that 's what happens . ''
