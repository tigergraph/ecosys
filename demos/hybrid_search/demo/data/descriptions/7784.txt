Don Henley and Glenn Frey wrote this song for their daughters .
Henley said in the Perth Sunday Times : `` It took me back to my own childhood and a reminder of how crushing and all-encompassing peer pressure is .
These kids are so vulnerable and susceptible to what people think about them .
Do other people like them ?
Are they cool ?
Do they have the right clothes , the right phone or the right iPod ? ''
