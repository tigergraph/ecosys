Buchanan explained the genesis of this song to Mojo magazine : `` The building that I live in looks onto other Glasgow buildings .
You 're sitting in the kitchen at three in the morning , but if you look out there 's lights on all over the place .
You think , What are they thinking about ?
What 's keeping them awake ? ''
