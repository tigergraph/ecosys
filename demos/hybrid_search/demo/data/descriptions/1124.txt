This is a track from No Chocolate Cake , the fifth full-length album by American pop rock band the Gin Blossoms .
Front man Robin Wilson told Alternative Addiction this song was inspired by a Finnish group .
He explained : `` I 'm emotionally attached to one of my songs titled , ` Wave Bye-Bye . '
I 'm proud of that .
I set out to write the saddest possible thing I could .
I had been listening to a group called HIM , they 're a metal band from Finland .
They 're a global source , they 're huge .
Their T-shirts are for sale at Hot Topic .
I really got into the group .
I guess I was caught up in their world and decided to try and write something to write really sad and I thought it would cool to get the girls at Hot Topic to like one of our tunes . ''
No Chocolate Cake peaked at # 73 on the Billboard album chart , the highest rank for the Gin Blossoms since Congratulations I 'm Sorry peaked at # 10 in 1996 .
