This bears a strong resemblance to `` The Lion Sleeps Tonight '' by The Tokens in both its title and music , especially the first four notes Michael Stipe sings .
Rather than follow industry practice and simply pilfer the song , R.E.M. paid for the rights to use it .
As part of the deal , R.E.M. were asked to do a cover of the original `` Lion Sleeps Tonight . ''
That version appears on the single to `` Sidewinder , '' released in February 1993 .
When trying to name check Dr. Seuss in this song , lead singer Michael Stipe kept saying `` Zeus . ''
The laughing that can be heard on the track is Stipe laughing at his own inability to pronounce that correctly , which Mike Mills kept trying to get him to do .
Stipe says he loved Dr. Seuss as a kid , but always pronounced his name the wrong way .
Making an effort to interpret Michael Stipe 's lyrics in this song , R.E.M. bass player Mike Mills said , `` Half of the song is about somebody trying to get in touch with someone who can sleep on his floor .
The other half - you 're on your own . ''
In the chorus , what sounds like `` coney jah waker , '' is actually , `` call me when you try to wake her up . ''
This song topped a 2010 poll , which sought out the most misheard lyrics .
Four out of ten people polled thought `` Call me when you try to wake her up '' was `` Calling Jamaica . ''
