This song was already a live favorite prior to it being recorded .
Vampire Weekend debuted this song at the album-release show for their first album in January 2008 and then performed it during their appearance on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon in March 2009 .
Koenig explained in track-by-track production notes : `` It 's inspired by some of the same African vibes and rhythms that influenced the debut , but the finished product represents a new chapter in the band 's sound .
`` This song picks up where M79 left off .
Similar people , similar geography , but , I think , a more developed sense of purpose . ''
One of the lyrics refers to a Richard Serra Skatepark .
Koenig explained to The London Times January 23 , 2010 that the phrase occurred to him after he saw a Serra sculpture at MoMA and thought , `` if I could skate , that would be fun to skate on . ''
Frontman Ezra Koenig explained to MTV News : `` That song came together in a way that none of our older songs ever have .
-LSB- Multi-instrumentalist/producer -RSB- Rostam -LSB- Batmanglij -RSB- made a beat and sent it to us , and I spent some time writing lyrics and a melody to it , and then we put it together into what it is now .
On that level , it is very distinct from what we 've done . ''
Vampire Weekend are notorious for their use of African rhythms in their songs , describing their genre of music as `` Upper West Side Soweto '' Koenig commented to The Guardian January 7 , 2010 : `` It 's just as natural for us to listen to music from Africa as it is to Cream or whoever .
There 's no reason why Cream should be a bigger part of my heritage -- my family is from eastern Europe and grew up in New Jersey and Eric Clapton is a British guy playing the blues .
When you break it down like that , the rock 'n' roll canon becomes a little less monolithic .
Just because I grew up a white guy in America does n't mean that 's the music of my life . ''
