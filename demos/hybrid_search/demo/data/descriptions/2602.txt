Caillat told Artistdirect.com about this song : `` A lot of people did n't want that one on the record because it 's sad and very melancholy .
I wanted that song on there because I think it 's important .
Yes , we have these fun , happy up-tempo songs , but I think every artist should have a song that you can cry to .
I wrote that song about a family friend of mine who was going through two years of terrible things happening to her .
Her two dogs died of cancer .
Her parents both died in the two-year span , and her husband left her .
She was going through the worst thing that anyone can go through in life .
I put myself in her shoes and I wrote about it .
I wrote about what was happening to her , and how she was `` Breaking at the cracks , everything was going black and it 's like a million heart attacks . ''
On the next part of the song , I wanted to show that you can get through it -- it 's not the end of the world .
There are ways you can get past these really difficult times in life . ''
