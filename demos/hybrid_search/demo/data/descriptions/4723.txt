This is the title track of singer-songwriter Holly Williams ' third album .
She explained its inspiration : `` I was pulling up to the gas station and I started singing the chorus ... came out of nowhere , prayers answered !
I went home and grabbed my guitar ... I was so thrilled about this lyric because it was exactly where my longing has been .
This came from a very personal place .
I 've begun to really miss the road .
`` Holly has plenty to do at home in Nashville , where she owns a clothing store called H. Audrey and enjoys cooking and homemaking .
She married her musical partner Chris Coleman in 2009 , giving her all the ingredients for domestic bliss .
The allure of the road , however , remained strong and meant that future Williams progeny -LRB- likely musical - Holly 's dad is Hank Jr. and her grandfather is Hank Sr. -RRB- would have to wait .
`` If it was n't for the music , I would have started having babies a long time ago , '' Holly told us .
`` I want at least three kids that I keep putting off because of music . ''
Williams says that this is a very important song for her , because it 's the fruit of a long and arduous recording process where she refused to compromise until the album was just right .
Before Holly wrote this song , the album was complete and ready to ship with the title Railroad -LRB- there are some promo copies of this version floating around Nashville -RRB- .
`` I was actually done with the record , '' she told us .
`` I 'd paid for it to be mastered , the artwork was done , and I wrote that song .
And I kept telling Charlie -LRB- producer Charlie Peacock -RRB- , ` There 's something else I need to say .
I do n't know what it is , but I know there 's something else that 's going to come out . '
And that was just such a true story of where I am right now , that longing for the road and the highway . ''
