There are two theories on this song 's meaning :1 -RRB- It 's about a girl who thinks the world revolves around her , with the singer knocking her down a peg by letting her know the she is n't Jesus .2 -RRB- The song is questioning the existence of Jesus , saying that if he existed , why would n't he put an end to all this mayhem on earth instead of sitting in heaven watching it.In our 2013 interview with Shaun Morgan of Seether , he gave us the answer . ''
` No Jesus Christ ' is called that because of people with their God complexes that I was surrounded by for a while , '' he said , adding , `` And it may or may not have been inspired by a girlfriend that talked a lot of crap about me in the press .
`` That girlfriend would be Amy Lee , who wrote the song `` Call Me When You 're Sober '' about Shaun in 2006 and slagged him off in the press .
So the song is not about religion , but people with God complexes .
