This plea for reparation is one of four tracks on Old Ideas that Cohen co-wrote with Patrick Leonard .
The American songwriter-producer is best known for co-penning many of Madonna 's late '80s hits including `` Live to Tell `` and `` Like A Prayer . ''
The female vocalist who opens the song is Dana Glover who is best known for performing film songs such as the duet `` Plan On Forever '' for The Wedding Planner and `` The Way -LRB- Radio Song -RRB- '' for Two Weeks Notice .
The song finds Cohen asking that the heavens hear this `` penitential hymn . ''
`` I 'm not sure what this means , '' said the singer-poet during a press preview in London -LRB- as reported by The Sun -RRB- .
`` Is the penitence appropriate to God or man ?
I mean who is to blame for this catastrophe ? ''
