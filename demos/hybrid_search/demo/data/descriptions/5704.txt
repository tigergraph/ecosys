This breezy Boi-1da produced track finds Minaj reflecting on her life and being in the spotlight .
It was released as the lead single from the re-release of her second studio album , Pink Friday : Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up .
Colin Tilley directed the song 's music video , which was shot on a shingle beach in Dungeness , 60 miles south east of London .
Tilley has collaborated with Minaj on her previous clips for `` I Am Your Leader '' and `` The Boys '' .
She told The Boombox , `` it 's definitely the most special video that I 've ever shot , '' adding , `` We went out to the outskirts of London and it was literally hailing and we had to get the video done because we had one day .
It was so cold and I 'm shooting in the cold rain and hail but it was just a very dope look .
`` This is n't the first time Dungeness was the location for a pop video .
The Kentish town , which is best known for its unsightly nuclear power plant , previously provided the setting for the Lighthouse Family 's 1998 UK hit , `` High . ''
