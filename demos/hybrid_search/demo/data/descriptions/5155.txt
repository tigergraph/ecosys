This song chronicles the experiences the band members had prior to recording The Soft Bulletin .
Lead singer Wayne Coyne 's father passed the year before , bassist Michael Ivins was in a very strange car accident .
Lastly , drummer/guitarist Steven Drozd came close to having to have his arm amputated due to a spiderbite .
It turned out that Drozd 's arm was abscessed as a result of his heroin use rather than because of the spider bite .
Wayne Coyne recalled to Uncut magazine June 2008 : `` Everyone wants to know on ` Spiderbite Song ' whether I really knew that Steven had a drug problem .
All I can say is , not as much as I knew later !
Everybody was busy doing their own trip , and being around drug addicts , they 're not much different than they were the previous week .
I mean , it happens so slowly that you get used to it .
It must be like those guys that have giant tumors on their faces .
It grows a little every day .
When I think of it now , I 'm surprised at how precarious the whole thing was .
That probably played into the song and the whole theme of the LP .
In a way I probably thought that Steven may not even be here for another year . ''
This song is very piano-driven but has an intriguing drum effect all throughout .
