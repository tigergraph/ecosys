Archuleta penned this plea to hold on with former * NSYNC-er JC Chasez .
This was one of two songs on Archuleta 's self-titled debut album that he has writing credits for , the other one being `` A Little Too Not Over You . ''
The Utah singer told MTV News that recording a song he had a hand in crafting was n't any more difficult than singing someone else 's song , but it did allow him to have a better understanding of what he was singing about .
He explained that this song , `` was a lot of fun to record 'cause I really understood the song . ''
