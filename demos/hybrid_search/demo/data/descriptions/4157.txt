This is the second single released by Philadelphia hip hop duo Chiddy Bang comprising Chiddy Anamege and Noah `` Xaphoon Jones '' Beresin .
It was released in the United Kingdom on May 17 , 2010 as a digital download and CD single .
Chiddy explained to CMU how the duo create a track : `` Noah usually comes up with the beat first and then he 'll play it for me .
I know right away if it 's right .
When he comes with the fire I can finish a track pretty quick .
That 's my barometer .
If in the first few seconds of a track I can hear some ideas - I know it 's something I should work on . ''
The song samples Passion Pit 's `` Better Things '' from the Chunk of Change EP that was released in 2008 .
