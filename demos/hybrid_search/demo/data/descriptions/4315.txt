This is the first single from British pop rap vocalist Tinchy Stryder 's third studio album , Flashing Lights .
The song features rapper and MC Tinie Tempah .
Stryder discussed the story of the song and its meaning in an interview with The Sun newspaper : `` I heard the beats first and I thought there 's something right about it and everything naturally came out .
It 's a reminder to people about staying humble . ''
Stryder explained the cut to The Daily Star : `` It 's a statement of intent - there 's more to come .
I 'm teasing ya .
I have n't called it ` Gangsta ' because I think I 'm gangsta .
Gangsta means cool .
Like I 'd say your jacket looks gangsta . ''
