This dance-R & B tune is the fourth single from R&B singer Chris Brown 's third studio album , Graffiti .
Brown explained to MTV News why it was chosen as the follow-up to `` Crawl '' : `` It 's gon na be a nice record - that 's gon na be , like , my third single .
After ` Crawl , ' that 's gon na be , like , the pop , then we gon na come with the urban at the same time . ''
In this song Brown trades verses with Eva Simons , a Dutch singer who first came to international prominence with her hit `` Silly Boy . ''
Simons wrote the French lyrics that she sings at the beginning of this Euro/dance track .
`` I knew ` Call on Me , ' '' she told Billboard magazine .
`` When I heard the beat I thought it needed some sensual lyrics .
Since I speak French , I wrote something French . ''
The song was produced by Brian Kennedy who previously helmed `` Disturbia , '' a track Brown co-wrote for his one-time girlfriend Rihanna .
This dance tune about partying hard in the club borrows from Eric Prydz 's 2005 European hit `` Call On Me . ''
Brown said to MTV News : `` We took one of the samples : ' -LSB- call on -RSB- meeeeee , -LSB- call on -RSB- meeee . '
We took that and kind of changed it up .
It 's called ` Pass Out . '
Do it till you pass out , as far as dancing and going crazy in the clubs . ''
