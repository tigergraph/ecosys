Contrary to popular belief , the catchphrase `` Hasta la vista , baby '' did not originate from Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie Terminator 2 : Judgment Day - it originated as a lyric from this song , released four years prior to T2 .
Watley wrote the lyrics to this song about moving on after a breakup .
Andre Cymone , who often collaborated with Watley , wrote the music .
This was Watley 's first and biggest solo hit , spending four weeks at # 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 .
Prior to this , Watley was a member of the R&B vocal group Shalamar , and was also one of only two American acts -LRB- Kool & the Gang being the other -RRB- to participate in the original incarnation of Band Aid , the mostly British and Irish all-star group assembled by Bob Geldof to record `` Do They Know It 's Christmas ? '' .
