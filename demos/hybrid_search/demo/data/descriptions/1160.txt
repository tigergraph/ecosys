This electropop love song is the third single from Example 's -LRB- aka Elliot Gleave -RRB- second album , Wo n't Go Quietly .
The tune acts as the follow-up to the title track , which was the British rapper 's debut Top 10 hit and features production by drum 'n' bass guru Sub Focus .
Gleave explained his performing name to The Daily Mail : `` My initials are EG .
When I rapped in the playground , one guy gave me the nickname Example . ''
Gleve penned the track whilst on tour when he was missing his girlfriend .
He told Entertainment Focus UK the story of the song : `` I heard the beat and I was on tour at the time .
Sub Focus , the drum 'n' bass producer , sent it to me and I was on tour supporting Lily Allen .
When you 're on tour non-stop for three weeks you kind of get a bit lonely and miss your loved ones .
You miss your bed because you 're staying in hotels every night and driving everyday .
It came from quite an emotional place and out of that emotion I just started thinking about life without my girlfriend which is where the lyrics ` think of life without you ' comes from .
The song suggests going through a bad stage with your girlfriend or boyfriend .
I was n't so much going through a bad stage with my girlfriend it was more just a case of feeling a bit lonely on tour .
I wrote the whole song in about two hours on the way back from Glasgow to London .
That 's where that song stems from .
Some people have read into it and thought it 's about love fizzling out and what makes you stay with a person .
Other people have interpreted it as drugs kicking in at a festival so it 's open to interpretation . ''
This was declared the best British pop single of the last twelve months in September 2010 by the panel of Pop Justice 's Twenty Quid Music Prize .
