George Harrison was interviewed in depth for the September 6 , 1975 issue of Melody Maker ; his new album was also reviewed by the same journalist , Ray Coleman.Of this piano based track he said `` The Answer 's At The End '' is `` a powerful ballad , whose theme stems from an inscription written on the wall of George 's house at Henley '' .
This inscription is : `` Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass , you know his faults , now let his foibles pass '' .
These words of wisdom and the resulting song are entirely in keeping with Harrison , who was always the more philosophical of the Beatles .
