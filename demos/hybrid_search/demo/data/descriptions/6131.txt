This is the title track of Christian rock band Needtobreathe 's third album .
Drummer Joe Stillwell explained the album title to Rock Bottom : `` That 's coming from a place of being comfortable with the notch that we 've kind of carved out for ourselves in the music industry -- or the one that we 've found ourselves in more so .
Coming from a small town in South Carolina where there 's not a whole lot of music industry , and definitely not a whole lot of music scene -- kind of having a little bit of a chip on our shoulders about that ; the fact that we 've been doing this for ten years and we 've kind of had to work up through the ranks of a really long time and still not really feeling we 're a hundred percent .
We 're kind of on the outside looking in a little bit , and we 're comfortable with that -- that 's kind of where we 'd like to be at this point ; because that means we can do our own thing .
We can make the music that we love and think about it without bringing other peoples opinions into it too much , and I think that 's where the whole outsiders thing came from . ''
