This song was written by Ace Of Base singer Jenny Berggren , and it was based on the night of April 27 , 1994 , when she and her mother were both attacked by a crazed woman who threatened them with a knife after following Jenny home .
Both Jenny and her mother Birgitta were hurt but recovered ; however , it could 've a lot worst because Jenny 's sister and fellow band member Malin was also a target of the attacker .
The group had to get bodyguards after this nightmare ; the attacker was banned from re-entering Sweden .
