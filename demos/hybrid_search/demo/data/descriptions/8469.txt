Along with `` Roots In Stereo , '' this was one of two tracks from the Testify album that P.O.D. worked on with the Jewish Reggae artist Matisyahu .
Lead singer Sonny Sandoval said : `` This is a Psalm of David .
Matis had dug into his Scriptures and chose this one .
The lyrics read , ` Even if there would be an army against me , my heart would not fear . '
King David placed his heart and trust into the God he believed in .
This is a worship song for us . ''
