On this track , Matt Bellamy sings of risk takers who are destroying the world 's economy .
He howls with rage at the greed of bankers and stockbrokers as well as industries desperate to kill the competition .
Bellamy told NME : `` These are some of the biggest crimes in history .
It 's phenomenal and it 's left the rest of the public having to fund their mistakes .
The world of business seems to be wild .
That song is conjuring up the rawest form of that feeling of , ` Look what humans are capable of doing , it 's shocking . ''
Speaking with Q magazine , Bellamy explained the song is primarily aimed at former Bank Of Scotland CEO Fred Godwin .
His strategy of aggressive expansion primarily through acquisition eventually proved disastrous and led to the near-collapse of the bank .
Goodwin was forced to stand down as CEO amidst widespread criticism .
