In a September 2012 interview with Digital Journal through Andrew Thompson of their management company , one of the band members said of this track : '' -LSB- It 's -RSB- ... just -LSB- about -RSB- the fact that really there is no better feeling than having a bit of money in your pocket , it gives you choices in life .
Who does n't like that feeling of being a millionaire for a day when you get your wages ? ''
Running to 4 minutes 39 seconds , the uptempo `` Money -LRB- Everybody Loves Her -RRB- '' is the fourth song on the band 's monster debut album Taking On The World .
Written by guitarist Giuliano Gizzi and lead vocalist Mark Rankin , it was released as a single backed by `` Prime Time '' , another Gizzi/Rankin composition .
