This was inspired by a female model Just Jack met in a club .
In the Daily Mail , April 13 , 2007 , he said : `` The girl in the club is the focus of the song , but I 've dragged in other characters too .
It 's about grown-up clubbers who should have moved on to something better .
It 's a sad situation , but there 's also some hope there .
This song shows Just Jack 's love of French dance music .
`` It 's a big influence , as Funk , Jazz and Disco never became dirty words in France , '' he says .
