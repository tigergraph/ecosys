Taylor wrote this duet with British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran whilst they were sitting on a trampoline .
She recalled to MTV News : `` We , for real , -LSB- were -RSB- sitting on my trampoline in my backyard cause we had been writing a song and I was like , ` Hey , I just got a trampoline .
You want to see it ? '
And so , he brought the guitar for some reason .
`` Taylor added : `` We ended up writing an entire song out there .
For portions of the song , -LSB- we were bouncing around -RSB- 'cause it 's a trampoline and it 's fun , and the combined maturity level of both of us is 8 years old . ''
Ed Sheeran is one of several songwriters that Swift reached out to write with her on Red .
She told Billboard magazine that the people she chose to collaborate with were ones who inspired her .
`` You look at someone like Ed Sheeran , '' she said .
`` He comes from such a sincere place as a writer , and his songs move you in every direction emotionally .
That 's something I was so inspired by I ended up calling him . ''
Regarding the song 's meaning , Taylor told Digital Spy : `` It 's about falling in love .
It 's about meeting someone and all of a sudden your entire perspective on the world changes - you 're thinking for two , instead of one . ''
Swift first came across Sheeran when she heard one of his singles while traveling abroad .
`` I was in Australia when I first saw Ed Sheeran 's music video for ` Lego House ' and I was so blown away by his voice that I found a way to get his album , the entire album , even though it was not on sale in the U.S. yet , '' Swift told MTV News .
`` And became a huge fan . ''
Though Sheeran comes from a folk background and Swift a pop-country one , the English singer-songwriter told MTV News their partnership worked as they have a lot in common .
`` Well , I do n't really write so much with other artists , '' he said .
`` Like the Taylor session , when we got together and wrote was the second time I 've ever gotten with another singer/songwriter and written a song with them .
So it was n't actually too hard of an adjustment .
We 're very much alike musically and it worked out well , I think . ''
The song was produced by Butch Walker , who once covered Swift 's `` You Belong With Me . ''
Asked by The Sun how Sheeran and her originally met up , Swift replied : `` We had both reached out to each other 's camps at the same time .
I showed up at his hotel in Arizona and we just wrote songs all day .
Then he came and hung out at my house in LA and we spent all night sitting on the kitchen floor laughing , writing songs and harmonising . ''
According to Sheeran , it was Swift who did most of the work when they penned this tune .
`` She pretty much came with the song and was like , ` Which bits would you change ? ' ''
he told the Wall Street Journal .
`` I was like , ` Oh , I do n't know . ' ''
