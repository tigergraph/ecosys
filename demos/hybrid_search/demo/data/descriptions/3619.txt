This track , according to Enya 's website , is an instrumental meant for reflection .
Enya 's producer Nicky Ryan explained on Enya 's website that they `` started out writing for a Christmas album , but it has evolved into more an Enya album based in a winter landscape where Christmas arrives here and there , but it would be wrong to call it an Enya Christmas album . ''
