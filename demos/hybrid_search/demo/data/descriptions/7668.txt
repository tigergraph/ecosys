The opening track of Lauren Alaina 's debut album is this up-tempo Country-Rock tune .
Clearly , the songwriters , Mallary Hope , Blair Daly and Rachel Proctor , penned the song with the young Georgia native in mind .
`` First of all , I am a Georgia peach !
, '' said Lauren to Taste of Country .
`` When I heard the title of the song , I liked it .
After I heard the full song , I fell in love with it .
It 's one of my favorites on the album .
It is uptempo and a song that everyone can dance to .
It 's great because it says there is nothing sweeter than Georgia peaches , and in the bridge it welcomes people in who are n't from Georgia : ` It do n't matter where you 're from / Come on in and have some fun . ' ''
