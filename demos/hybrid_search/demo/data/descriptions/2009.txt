Simons wrote this with her songwriting partner Mike Hamilton , Italian DJ and dance producer Benny Benassi and his cousin Alle Benassi .
German electro house producer Anton `` Zedd '' Zaslavski laid down the beat .
Zedd also co-produced Justin Bieber 's collaboration with Nicki Minaj , `` Beauty and a Beat . ''
The song topped Billboard 's Hot Dance Club Songs chart , giving Simons her first US Dance # 1 .
Simons told the story of the song to Artist Direct : `` That song is funny .
We were in the studio with Benny Benassi .
I had an off day , and I was a bit pissed off at someone .
When I hear a beat , I go into the booth and lay down some ideas .
Mike saw that I was really pissed -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
He was like , ` Let 's go with that . '
That 's the story . ''
A Nick Thayer remix was included on the soundtrack of the 3D dance movie Step Up : Revolution .
