Most of the Bon Iver song titles are named after places , but the clue to this piano ballad is in the lyrics .
The song is addressed to Claire , however it appears frontman Justin Vernon is not singing of his love for a girl by that name but to his hometown Eau Claire in Wisconsin .
Vernon explained the song 's meaning to Qmagazine : `` Wash , could be Washington state .
Really , it 's about the March rains in Eau Claire , which wash the snow away . ''
