After touring extensively in support of their debut album We Started Nothing , the Ting Tings retired to Berlin to begin work on their sophomore set .
A year later , unsettled by their label 's excitement over its commercial prospects , the pair scrapped their work and relocated to southern Spain .
At the start of 2011 , The Ting Tings were pointed in the direction of the Beastie Boys album , Paul 's Boutique and found themselves fascinated by its many nuances .
It encouraged the duo to allow themselves a freedom to move around musically - thus the title of their second album Sounds From Nowheresville .
Multi-instrumentalist Jules De Martino told The Independent why the duo used the squeaking chair as part of their percussion .
`` We do n't have any vocal booth , '' he explained , `` so sometimes Katie just has a quilt over her head and sings standing next to the control desk .
We 'd hear this squeak on the track , and we realized that every time I sat and pressed record , it 'd go ` eeuuk ' . ''
On ` Soul Killing , ' there seemed to be something missing from the ska groove , apart from the bit when Katie was about to sing.We analyzed the good bit and found it was this squeaking chair , '' De Martino added .
`` So we miked the chair up and I recorded it through the whole track , and it worked perfectly . ''
The song features horns , a bouncy reggae vibe and the squeak of a rocking chair as percussion as well as the band 's signature treble-heavy guitar . ''
` Soul Killing ' is about frustration in this biz .
This is a real squeaking rocking-chair song .
Do n't let anyone shoot you down !!! '' singer and guitarist Katie White told Spinner .
