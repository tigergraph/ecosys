This song is based on the film Mars Attacks !
, which is based on a card series by Topps that was criticized by parents and was pulled from shelves , but was very popular with children .
A spinoff card series , Dinosaurs Attack !
, was also made , yet was very inaccurate in describing certain dinosaurs and creatures .
This was going to be used in the film , but it was not delivered in time for filming .
