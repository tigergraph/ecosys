On March 1 , 2008 , this song , which was written by Abraham with Andy Watkins and Paul Wilson , was chosen as the UK 's 2008 entry for the Eurovision Song Contest .
On March 3 , Abraham appeared on BBC1 's Breakfast news program where he said he wrote it to make people feel good on the dance floor .
Unfortunately , that sentiment was not shared by the voters ; the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest was won for the first time by Russia with 272 points .
`` Even If '' scored only 14 points , coming joint bottom with the German and Polish entries .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England -RRB- This also flopped in the UK singles chart .
The last UK Eurovision entry that failed to reach the top 40 was `` Why Do I Always Get it Wrong '' by Live Report back in 1989 .
A number of commentators blamed this song 's Eurovision failure on block voting .
However , despite being a pleasant song , it had an outdated 1980s sound , which simply did not appeal to the majority of the European juries .
Meanwhile the very current and hip Timbaland produced the winning Russian entry .
