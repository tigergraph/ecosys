Lostprophets lead vocalist Ian Watkins explained the song 's meaning to Kerrang !
: `` This is about wanting another chance with someone , but you know it 's not the best thing for them .
So there 's that battle of conscience - can you be the bigger person and let them go , or will you be selfish because you want them to stay ?
It feels like something from -LRB- Linkin Park 's -RRB- Hybrid Theory . ''
Watkins told NME : `` This was the first song we finished in these sessions .
It 's only one-track vocals , no harmonies or anything .
I think we only did the song like three times and that was it , which was pretty crazy and was new for me .
We did n't really expect that -- just went in , sang the song three times and that was it .
We did n't really think much of it , then we listened to it and it had a cool vibe about it . ''
