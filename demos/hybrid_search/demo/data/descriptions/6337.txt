Hiatt was busy promoting his The Tiki Bar Is Open album in New York when 9/11 happened .
He penned this autobiographical number about the atrocity after a couple of days in Philadelphia , and performed it at New York 's Town Hall later that month .
Hiatt never intended to record the tune but ten years later it ended up closing his Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns set .
He told Billboard magazine : `` I played it for -LSB- producer -RSB- Kevin Shirley .
He was living in New York at the time with little kids in school and he reacted as someone who lived there , saying I should record it .
I had mixed feelings .
I felt like there was some distance , and time takes a little bit of the sting out .
The music in the song sounds like -LSB- the -RSB- horror that it was .
We just started making that racket and at the end of the song a bit of hope pokes out in the lyric ` She will rise again . '
It seemed to work out musically . ''
