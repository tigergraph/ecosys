The success of Barnes ' What We Want , What We Get , especially Blake Shelton 's cover of his God Gave Me You track led the Nashville-based singer-songwriter to concentrate more on hooks on his fifth release , Stories To Tell That is epitomized by this song , which was released as the second single from the set .
He explained to Alternative Addiction : `` That song , one of the really big reasons that I hired John Fields to produce the album was because I wanted to candy-coat this record with hooks .
That 's something I love about modern-day pop music .
You can throw everything but the kitchen sink , maybe even the kitchen sink .
What we did here , anything that we could have that will get you to continue to listen , we 're going to do . ''
`` I 've always stayed away from that , '' he added , `` because I wanted my music to have an integrity that did n't feel like I was trying to overwhelm people .
But I thought it would be fun to do one record where I kind of slide the chips over - really go ` let 's put every hook that I can sing , play , or we can think of in a song . '
That song is the epitome of that .
It 's the litmus paper test of every little thing we could think of , we did .
It 's kind of fun because I 've never let myself do that .
This record is kind of that record for me . ''
