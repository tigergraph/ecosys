This was originally released in Robyn 's native country Sweden in 2005 , reaching # 18 .
It was credited solely to producers Kleerup with Robyn relegated to guest star status .
The following year import copies began to be played in British clubs and it was re-released in 2007 , this time as a Robyn single , with Kleerup reduced to the `` featuring '' role .
Robyn told the Metro newspaper October 25 , 2007 : `` With Every Heartbeat is not a typical # 1 song - it does n't really have a chorus and it has a weird string break in the middle , so it was n't expected .
But when it started to climb up the charts , we all watched it very closely .
The song deserved to be a # 1 , so I 'm not surprised but it was n't expected either . ''
Robyn is a Swedish Electro Pop singer , who had two # 7 hits on the Hot 100 in the mid 1990s with `` Do You Know -LRB- What it Takes -RRB- '' and `` Show Me Love . ''
The latter also peaked at # 8 in the UK .
She then disappeared until 2007 when she had a UK chart topper with this song .
