This song was written by Pitbull for Dr Pepper 's 2011 Hispanic marketing campaign .
Pitbull told Billboard magazine : `` The beauty of it I think is showing how major corporations want to be involved with people whose last names are Gutiérrez , Pérez , etc. .
Names than end with a z .
The cool thing is , when I was a kid , Dr. Pepper was my favorite . ''
The DJ Snake and Clinton Sparks produced song features the model and actress Nayer , who was previously in the video for Pitbull 's `` I Know You Want Me , '' wearing a police uniform .
