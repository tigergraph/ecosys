In our interview with Marcy Playground lead singer/songwriter John Wozniak , he explained : `` That 's a song that a lot of people seem to really dig .
It 's one of those impression songs .
In the end , it 's telling the story about me trying to convince my friend not to do heroin anymore .
And that became a theme of my life because I went to college in Olympia , Washington , in the early '90s .
It was sort of a port area in the Pacific Northwest where all the heroin trade was coming through .
And everybody was on it at the time in the early '90s .
And all my friends were sort of disappearing , and I did n't know where they were going .
I found out they were all doing heroin .
And they were doing it together , which is really a weird thing .
But I never did it .
It was not something I was ever interested in .
In fact , drugs are something that never really interested me , except for some experimentation .
But I just started watching friends die and disappear and drop out of school and stuff , and turning up in houses in San Francisco and s -- t like that .
And my one closest friend I tried to convince to stop doing it , and that 's what that song 's about .
`` John is n't sure if the subject of this song knows it 's about him .
He says , `` I have n't spoken to him in 15 , 16 years .
I have no idea if he 's dead or alive , actually .
Some people I do n't need in my life , even though I love them .
You have to protect yourself sometimes . ''
John Wozniak is a self-described `` nerd , '' who wrote a song with a Dungeons & Dragons concept for their debut album -LRB- `` A Cloak of Elvenkind '' -RRB- .
It 's no surprise that he would look to the world of anime for this song title : the Wave Motion Gun is a weapon in the series Space Battleship Yamato .
It 's very powerful , but leaves the ship defenseless for a time after firing it .
Not a bad metaphor for drugs .
