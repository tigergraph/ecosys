This song , which is about a girl who acts as if she is tough but still needs to feel that loving fire , was written by Brett Beavers , Brett Warren and Brad Warren .

The two Warrens record together as the Warren Brothers and they have had over ten entries on the Hot Country Songs chart .
The brothers have also co-penned songs for other artists such as `` If You 're Reading This '' for Tim McGraw , `` The Lucky One '' for Faith Hill and `` Anyway '' for Martina McBride .
This was Bentley 's sixth # 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart .
Bentley told AOL : `` That song makes me think of my wife , Cassidy .
She likes black nail polish , so that 's how it got started . ''
