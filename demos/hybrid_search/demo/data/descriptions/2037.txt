Vocalist Gaz Coombes told the Daily Mirror December 4 , 2008 that this song was inspired by an experience in Detroit when the frontman could n't wait to get home to his wife , Jools and their two daughters .
He explained : `` It was the one time I felt like getting on a plane and coming straight back home .
We were in a really scary area and we had a run-in with some law enforcement officers in a doughnut shop .
It was very intimidating .
Then we played a place with chicken wire mesh in front of the stage .
I was pining for home .
Although that does n't happen often , it was important to get it out there . ''
