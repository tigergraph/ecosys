This quick and funky number with a message of `` prepare yourself for just about anything , '' is the title track from American R&B - soul singer -- songwriter Angie Stone 's fifth studio album .
The song 's backbeat was inspired by Sly Stone 's 1971 hit , `` Fight For This Love . ''
Stone explained in publicity materials that the album title came from the sudden passing of her father midway through the recording of the album .
`` It was totally unexpected , '' she said , `` and that 's where I came up with the title of the album .
I really did n't think I could finish the project , because I was so grief stricken ... I had to do a lot of the vocals a second time .
I had to lean on my dad 's wisdom and energy , and try to be open to what he would have wanted me to do in order to finish the songs .
I can say that his spirit was literally there in the studio with me , and I 'm grateful for that . ''
