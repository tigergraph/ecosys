New York-based indie rock group The Walkmen open their seventh studio album with this nostalgic acoustic track .
`` I always really liked the idea of doing -LSB- something -RSB- that 's really small and intimate-sounding because we 're always so big , '' frontman Hamilton Leithauser told Billboard magazine .
`` That song 's really directly inspired by one of my favorite bands , the Fleetwoods , from the '50s . ''
This is one of four tracks on Heaven that features harmony vocals from Fleet Foxes ' Robin Pecknold .
`` We toured with them last fall and really liked them as guys and really liked their band , '' Leithauser noted to Billboard magazine .
`` I really wanted someone else , another voice on the record , and none of our guys would really be willing to sing ... Once you add his voice in there , it brings a whole new sound to the record . ''
