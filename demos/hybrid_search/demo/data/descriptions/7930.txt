This is the opening track and first single from The Light Meets The Dark , the second major label studio album from American Christian pop rock band Tenth Avenue North .
The band comprises vocalist Mike Donehey , guitarist Jeff Owen and drummer Jason Jamison .
Owen commented that he feels this song encapsulates the theme of the album .
He explained : `` It 's where the title of the record comes from .
It 's basically about confession - confessing your sins to one another that you might be healed , which is a scary thing to do .
You can believe in God and love God , but confessing the things that you keep secret and hold on to - that keep you tied to your past and weigh you down - confessing those things is not easy .
You can experience such freedom in telling someone else .
You know that God knows everything about you , but telling someone else is an entirely different thing . ''
Donehey said in publicity materials : `` On this record I really tried to be honest about how messed up I am .
We wanted it to be a collision between our hearts and God 's truth .
His grace collides with the dark inside of us .
His blood can cover us and I 'm trying to call people out and say ` Look , please do not hide your darkness .
Expose that to the light . '
I know that 's the scariest thought , but its where freedom and healing starts to take place .
It 's where it all starts to happen . ''
