This is the first single to be released to urban adult contemporary radio from Gospel artist Kirk Franklin 's 12th album , Hello Fear . '' '
I Smile ' is a fun , urban upbeat melody I wrote , '' said Franklin .
`` It is a declarative statement that I 'm not going to live my life based on how I feel .
I will live my life based on God 's Word . ''
The song features compositional aid from the S.O.S. Band 's 1983 single `` Tell Me If You Still Care '' and also from the 1973 Little Feat song `` Fool Yourself . ''
In our 2012 interview with Kirk Franklin , he explained why he borrowed from those songs : `` I just thought they would be cute ear candy , like what if I use a little sample of something .
For me it 's always ear candy .
And I just thought it would be really cool for the bridge of the song to be this familiar R&B song that everybody remembered .
A lot of times when you 're communicating a message like mine - which for the most part is a question - it 's sometimes easier to digest or get that message across when you use familiarity .
So that 's what I was trying to do . ''
This was the first Kirk Franklin single to reach the Hot 100 in six years .
The previous song to do so was `` Looking for You '' in 2005 which peaked at # 61 .
This was named Contemporary Gospel Recorded Song of the Year at the 2012 Gospel Music Association Dove Awards .
Franklin also won the award for Contemporary Gospel Album of the Year at the same ceremony .
