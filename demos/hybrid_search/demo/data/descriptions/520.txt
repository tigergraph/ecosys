Deftones lead singer Chino Moreno explained that this song is a reference to the turmoil they went through making the Saturday Night Wrist album .
About a year into recording , Moreno felt it was n't up to standard and started putting his efforts into his ambient music side project , Team Sleep .
Moreno was also going through a divorce and doing a lot of speed , which did n't help .
`` Hole in the Earth '' was Moreno 's way of addressing that challenges he and his bandmates faced to make the record .
Chino says he did n't explain his lyrics to the band until after the album was recorded .
This was the first single released from Saturday Night Wrist .
The album title is a reference to a medical condition one of Moreno 's friends suffered called Saturday Night Palsy , which is caused by sleeping with your arm over a chair or with someone lying on it - typically the person has passed out drunk when this happens .
A notable victim of this condition is Dave Mustaine from Megadeth .
