Currington told AOL about this tune written by Jim Beavers and Chris Hennessee : `` From the get-go , when you hear the guitar start off , it just has that feel , that groove , that you just do n't want to get out of , you know ?
It 's just a great groovy song , and it 's very simple .
You love everything about this person , everything about her turns you on .
I do n't know , it just had that cool factor to me .
I could n't get it out of my head .
That was the one thing about this song .
I remember after I heard the demo , for nights and nights on end , I would wake up by the melody and the lyrics , and that right there told me I better record it .
If it 's got that effect on me , it 'll probably have that effect on other people too . ''
