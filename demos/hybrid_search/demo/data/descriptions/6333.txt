This Just Blaze-produced expletive-laden song , in which Eminem takes aim at various targets and eggs on haters to take him on , is the opening track from his seventh studio album Recovery .
The Detroit MC told his Shade 45 satellite-radio station about the album : `` I definitely feel like I 'm in a little different space right now , '' he said .
`` With the last record , it had a lot to do with me getting sober and just my eyes being open again and my brain went into overdrive .
With Relapse , I was just trying to prove to myself that I could do it again .
It was a -LSB- reintroduction -RSB- and what made me in the first place with the zany , loony , ridiculous sh -- .
I felt like a lot of that album , I kind of wanted to -LSB- spit -RSB- rapid fire and -LSB- do -RSB- punch lines . ''
Eminem spits on this cut , `` But take a look at Mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song . ''
Slim Shady has claimed he had a relationship with Mariah Carey in 2001 and previously alluded to it on his Relapse track , `` Bagpipes From Baghdad . ''
Ms. Carey denies the entire affair .
This is one of three tracks on Recovery produced by Just Blaze .
The New Jersey hip hop producer is best known for his work with Jay-Z on such tracks as `` Girls , Girls , Girls '' and `` Show Me What You Got . ''
He has also worked with Kanye West , Usher and Mariah Carey .
