This song about the hazards of the search for fame was used as the exit song during the Hollywood Week for the 2008 series of American Idol .
Somewhat ironic , as the Idol contestants are searching for fame .
Ferras said on his website : `` I think Aliens and Rainbows is about that other place you go to in your mind when you just want to escape .
When the world you live in is n't fun anymore and lets you down .
When people let you down and you feel misunderstood .
It is a place for dreamers , misfits and outsiders .
It is a place where all kinds of creatures exist , who are your friends and ` get ' you , and you suddenly feel a part of something and less like an outsider .
So I guess overall , I chose the title for the album because it is representative of how I feel .
Aliens and Rainbows -LRB- the place -RRB- is an escape from reality , a universe created by you .
I think my record is just that .
It is something that you turn on and escape and forget about everything for that moment . ''
`` Hollywood 's Not America '' was written by Ferras together with Lauren Christy , who is part of the songwriting team The Matrix .
Ferras told Billboard magazine : `` I was sitting down writing one night with Lauren , drinking wine and talking about Hollywood - how people come here to achieve dreams , and you realize at one point that it 's never going to be enough .
When you get to that point , you realize , ' I love myself , I love who I am , I do n't need all these things . '
I do n't want to be preachy in the song - it 's just an observation .
People ask me , ` Do you even like L.A. ? '
And yes , I love it . ''
