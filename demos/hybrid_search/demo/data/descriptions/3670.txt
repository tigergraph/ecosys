This relationship anthem , which starts with children 's chants , is the opening track from Australian dance-pop singer-songwriter Sia 's fourth studio album , We Are Born .
She told CMU what inspired the album : `` It 's kind of like a compilation of all the up-tempo stuff I 've done over the past six years .
My label sort of pigeon-holed me as a down-tempo artist but , as this record shows , I can make poppier songs too !
Generally , though , I 'm inspired by what 's going on around me ; if I 'm upset I 'll write about that ; if I 've just watched Grey 's Anatomy and something moves me in that then I 'll write about that ; if I speak to friends and they 're having problems , then I 'll write about that . ''
