Aimee Mann told the Independent newspaper June 20 , 2008 about this autobiographical song : `` I pretty much base all my characters on real people , exaggerating their situations and '31 Today ' is about me , but I was also thinking about people I knew back then - ` getting loaded watching CNN ' .
There was a guy I went out with for a while who was a musician and had a trust fund , so that 's all he did .
You can kid yourself that you 're staying informed , but really . ''
The music video for the song features improvisational comedic acting by Morgan Murphy , and was directed by Bobcat Goldthwait .
The song 's lyrics sum up the disappointment and self-concern of many 20 - and 30-somethings in the U.S. `` I thought my life would be different somehow / I thought my life would be better by now . ''
Mann 's disillusionment is her own feeling , but she 's also lambasting her peers for focusing so much on themselves and the twentysomething angst and uncertainty , that has now become thirtysomething ennui .
