Alabama Shakes lead singer Brittany Howard sings of a guy whom God brought to her on this song .
He is the same fellow that she lusts over in `` Be Mine , '' but who then turns out to be a cheater in `` Heartbreaker . ''
Howard told NME : `` It 's a true story .
I 'm a spiritual person ; it does n't matter to me if you believe in God or anything like that , I believe in something out there that looks after us .
I stopped going to church when I was around 10 years old . ''
