Voltaire has claimed at shows that this song was written while he was on a plane .
The flight was delayed for several hours because of weather .
After a while a woman stood up and said that if they all prayed together that God would hear their prayers and the weather would clear up , at which point he stood up and stole her thunder by going on about how God has infinite wisdom , but that his plans were an inconvenience to the people on the plane .
