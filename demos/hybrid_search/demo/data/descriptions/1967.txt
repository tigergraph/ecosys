Recorded for the end credits of the X-Men : First Class movie , five-piece man-band Take That debuted this song on May 18 , 2011 live on British TV at the National Movie Awards .
This was the second song Take That recorded for a major Hollywood movie , following their Rule The World hit from Stardust .
British director Matthew Vaughn directed both films .
Gary Barlow told the story of how the song was written on his website : The first day we arrived in LA we went to see a screening of X-Men .
The director was Matthew Vaughn , the same guy that we did Stardust with !
We left the screening extremely excited about doing a song for this film .
It was amazing .
We knew we had to blow them away as we knew other people were writing for this movie .
We worked on backing track I 'd put together before arriving at Rob -LRB- Williams -RRB- 's and soon found some magic !
In one play to the director he was in !
To be honest the finished record does n't sound a lot different to the demo .
We knew what we wanted from the word go on this one !
Stuart -LRB- Price , producer -RRB- added bass and toughened up the synths .
We used our demo vocals as it was so vibey and distorted ! ''
The foot-stomping pop anthem features the cryptic lyricism that appeared plentifully on Progress .
`` You bring me right back down to the Earth from the Promised Land / We 're getting close to the centre of the Earth with an honest plan / You 'll never be your mother or your father do you understand ? ''
sings Barlow in a vocoder-assisted voice .
The song is one of eight new tunes on Progressed , a repackaged version of their chart-topping LP Progress .
