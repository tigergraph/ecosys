The title is taken from a quote by the 19th century British Prime Minister , William Gladstone , `` All the world over , I will back the masses against the classes . ''
The opening sample , `` This country was founded on the principle that the primary role of government is to protect property from the majority , '' is by linguist and socialist Noam Chomsky .
At the end of the song a line is quoted from the French novelist and playwright Albert Camus ' 1951 book The Rebel : `` The slave begins by demanding justice and and ends by wanting to wear a crown . ''
Bassist and lyricist Nicky Wire explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` It was a reaction to the supposed bigness and blandness of This Is My Truth ... , coming back with something that starts with a Chomsky sample .
It 's not such a political song , it 's a song about us .
That idea that 10 years on , we 'd become one of the biggest bands in Britain .
But nobody really wanted to do it except me . ''
This was released in a strictly limited edition and deleted after one day .
As a result it sold 35,000 copies on the day of its release .
This was the first UK # 1 of 2000 .
