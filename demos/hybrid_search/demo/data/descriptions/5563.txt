Although the entire Jazz From Hell album is instrumental , it was released with a Parental Advisory sticker because of the title of this song .
The `` G-Spot '' refers to a female erogenous zone .
This piece was composed on an electric instrument called the Synclavier because Zappa felt that the piece as he envisioned it could never be played by any humans .
He was proven wrong when the Ensemble Modern performed it on his Yellow Shark tour .
