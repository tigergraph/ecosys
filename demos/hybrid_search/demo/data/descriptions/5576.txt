For Infinite Arms , the Band of Horses bandmates sent each other recordings and raw ideas via email .
Vocalist Ben Bridwell told The Skinny : `` This is completely written by Tyler Ramsay -LRB- guitarist -RRB- .
He sent me a demo of the music , I recorded vocals on top of it and it was embarrassingly bad but luckily he had the foresight to record his own vocals and lyrics . ''
