In this piano ballad which Atkins co-wrote with Bill Kirsch , a man pretends to be composed about splitting up with his girl , but is in fact , `` invisibly shaken , quietly breaking , desperately taking one breath at a time . ''
Atkins revealed to AOL that he had to push for this to be included on the album .
He recalled : `` I 've always loved singing that song .
I turned it in and it got passed on .
A&R at the time did n't acknowledge I turned it in , but the reaction we got from the crowds was such that I just forced it on there .
We cut it and now it 's a single . ''
This was originally included on Lee Greenwood 's 2003 album Stronger Than Time .
Greenwood is Atkin 's label mate with Curb Records .
