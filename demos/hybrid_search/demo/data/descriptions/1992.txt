This power-pop jam is the first song to be released from Swedish indie rock band Peter Bjorn and John 's sixth album , Gim me Some .
`` That 's one of John 's songs , '' singer/guitarist Peter Moren explained to Spin magazine .
`` He told me it was about a journalist that he hates -LSB- laughs -RSB- . ''
Lines like , `` I do n't even know you / But your words just cut me like a knife , '' Moren added , are `` basically about people with a lot of prejudice against certain ideas .
John was angry at something he read .
Maybe it was a bad album review ! ''
