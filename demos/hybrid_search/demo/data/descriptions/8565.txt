This Reggae-tinged track finds West linking up with fellow Chicago rapper King Louie , who delivers some raw rhymes .
The Chi-Town spitter told MTV News that he just went in and freestyled his performance during a recording session in Paris with Kanye .
`` When I did the joint , we were in the studio - no B.S. , like 20 hours strong , a day .
We were in Paris or whatever , '' he said .
`` I had woke up , and it was just a freestyle verse off the top and that turned out to be the one he was really rocking with ; just genuine bars . ''
The song samples Jamaican Dancehall artist Beenie Man 's 1996 single `` Memories . ''
Louie told MTV News that the finished version is very different from the original beat he recorded on .
`` The beat changed and what was part of my hook became the actual chorus , it was dope , '' he said .
`` The beat was just one instrument , two instruments and then now it 's like a whole party thing .
So it 's way different from when I recorded it . ''
