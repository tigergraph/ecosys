Frontman Max Bemis explained this song to Alternative Press : `` It 's about a college-age girl who is infatuated with a college-age guy who does n't love her at all but sleeps with her all the time .
So she finds an easier , more submissive guy to use to make this other guy jealous .
It 's a terrible love triangle .
In society , we see this happen all the time .
I 've seen this happen so many times : people pursue what is not healthy , including myself when I was younger .
I could have played any of these roles in my life .
We pursue that which is not healthy for us or gives us what we want .
It 's what seems viable based on what society 's standards are , such as being attractive .
In reality , it is just a lie that we 're pursuing and we are willing to hurt anyone to get that .
In that process , everyone gets really screwed over .
Even though society says this is dating , this is what it 's about : people get jealous of each other and people date people they do n't like that much .
All of these things are acceptable in society , but they are demeaning and make people feel terrible .
I wanted this song to illuminate what we think is normal for your love life is actually sometimes a really destructive process . ''
