This was the first release from Chester French 's debut album , Love The Future .
Vocalist D.A. Wallach told Complex Magazine : `` Neal Pogue mixed our album and told us it was cool but we needed some hit songs cause there are no hit songs .
So then we went and did ` Neal ' and ` She Loves Everybody . '
That 's the one everybody got behind and that 's why it 's the single . ''
This song reached # 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart .
The single release featured packaging in the style of a condom wrapper .
This tied in with the song 's lyrical themes .
The duo named themselves after the American sculptor Daniel Chester French , who designed the statues of Abraham Lincoln at the Washington DC Lincoln Memorial and John Harvard at Harvard University .
Wallach and Drummey were both college students at Harvard .
