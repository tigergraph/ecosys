She explained the routine in an interview with FaceCulture : `` We lived in the country .
It was like a 30 minute drive to school everyday .
We lived so far in the country the school bus would n't go there , so we would drive ... so during that time , we sang , '' she said .
Lynne 's major influences were singers like Elvis Presley , Bob Wills -LRB- as cited in the song -RRB- , The Everly Brothers , and The Mills Brothers - `` harmony type stuff . ''
She says she still searches for music that 's as great today .
`` That never leaves my being , because that 's the first music that I heard .
I ca n't shake it , that 's like in me . ''
