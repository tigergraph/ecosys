Heaven & Hell are basically Black Sabbath fronted by Ronnie James Dio rather than Ozzy Osbourne .
As far as their fans are concerned , The Devil You Know represented the first new Sabbath album since 1995 's Forbidden .
Dio explained this song to Rolling Stone : `` That one is about the government .
It 's a way of saying politicians are screwing us , so we 're going to eat them . ''
