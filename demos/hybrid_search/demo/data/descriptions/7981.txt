Frank Ocean has expressed his admiration for Drake in interviews , and this song finds him talking about his girl listening to the Canadian rapper plus Trey Songz .
However he explained to Complex magazine that the lyric , `` was more in sarcasm , and in jest , than it was in seriousness . ''
He explained : `` I do n't think any person in a serious relationship is threatened by the person on the radio .
It 's just a cool detail .
It 's not like you 're going to go off on your girl because she 's listening to whoever .
That does n't make any sense .
That 's some other s -- t. Like , you 'll f -- k with your girl .
You might poke fun at her like , ` You know I be recording and s -- t , but you do n't listen to my s -- t like that . '
It 's funny .
The s -- t does n't make it to a serious point , ever . ''
