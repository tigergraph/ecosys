The song 's chorus features the only use of the word `` defiance '' throughout the album - tying it in with the record title .
Lead vocalist Ryan Clark told Alternative Press : `` I 've always liked the idea of one word choruses .
Although this song has some additional screaming vocals in the chorus , it 's really based on that one word - resistance . ''
Clark told Alternative Press that one of his favorite parts on this song is Patrick Judge 's guitar solo .
He told Alternative Press : `` I like how unruly it gets towards the end - it 's like the whole thing comes unraveled ... the way some of -LRB- Slayer axeman -RRB- Kerry King 's solos do - not overtly musical , but more chaotic .
I think it shows a lot of diversity in Patrick 's influences . ''
