This ode to 1980s electro music features Ben Hudson from the English band Mr. Hudson & the Library , who are signed to West 's G.O.O.D. label .
Hudson also supplied additional vocals on `` Say You Will '' and `` Amazing '' and he also has a production credit on `` Street Lights . ''
The song 's bitter lyrics most likely allude to West 's long-term relationship with the designer Alexis Phifer .
The Chicago artist admitted that all the tracks on 808s & Heartbreak , apart from his eulogy to his mother `` Coldest Winter , '' are about `` someone else . ''
The song 's music video was helmed by photographer and director Nabil Elderkin , who previously worked with West on the `` Champions '' video and `` Welcome To Heartbreak . ''
Elderkin told MTV News about the video 's premise : `` It 's fantasy meets paranoid , when you get into that frame of mind and get trapped into your thoughts .
It starts out subtle , but then it just builds .
So I wanted to get that into the video , to build that into her dream sequence and get her into that paranoid state of mind . ''
This additionally features Cleveland rapper/singer Kid Cudi , from West 's G.O.O.D. label .
Cudi also has writing credits for several other tracks on 808s & Heartbreak including `` Heartless . ''
He explained to Complex Magazine his writing contributions : `` It 's a collective effort .
It 's not like ; where like I 'm sitting in a room writing songs .
It 's more like brainstorming and , you know , helping out with the inspiration and creativity and putting words together .
Making sure the stuff fits right . ''
This was previously leaked as `` Anything . ''
The video stars the Barbadian singer Rihanna .
She was cast on West 's recommendation .
Elderkin commented to MTV News : `` That was n't too much of a decision .
That was somewhere between ` hell yeah ' and ` yeah . '
Who would n't want to look at Rihanna ? ''
