This six and a half-minute album closer is one of the most musically ambitious numbers that Lamb Of God has ever recorded .
The longest song by the band to date , it climaxes with a full orchestra as well as opera singer Amanda Munton .
Lamb Of God drummer Chris Adler discussed the track during an interview with Lithium Magazine .
He said : `` The strings and the operatic sections in that song was a stretch for us .
When we first heard some of that stuff coming back from our sessions , it was n't that we did n't want to do it or that we do n't like the song now , but it was one of those things where on our initial listen we were all taken aback like , ` Whoa ... can we pull that off ?
Is this ok for us to do ? '
There are n't really any rulebooks to what we do , but it was strange .
The more we listened to it and spent time with it , and played the album without it , we realized how much stronger the album was with that track included . ''
The song featured in the trailer for the HBO vampire show , True Blood .
Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe is a self-proclaimed fan of all things to do with vampires and he expressed his excitement by stating : `` I am in VAMPIRE GEEK HEAVEN right now .
STOKED . ''
adding `` SO STOKED !!! & now I will drive to Kroger to pick up some pasta sauce , BLASTING ` King Me , ' & looking for goths to high-five ! ''
