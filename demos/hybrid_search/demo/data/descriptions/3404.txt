The opening track of 2010 X Factor winner Matt Cardle 's debut album is an euphoric pop tune , which he described to The Sun as `` a depressing happy song about the insignificance of everything . ''
Cardle penned the song with Seton Daunt , who is the lead guitarist for the British rock band Fiction Plane , along with Spice Girls collaborator Richard `` Biff '' Stannard , and Ash Howes , whose other credits include tracks recorded by Westlife and Kylie Minogue .
