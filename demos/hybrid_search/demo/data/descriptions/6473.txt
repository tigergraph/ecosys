Oberst told MTV News : `` I think of it as a pseudo-spiritual song - stomping feet and clapping hands .
I like that it 's short too .
I do n't have many short songs , but I like that about it .
`` The question was then asked if this reflected a rift with New York , to which Oberst replied : `` No .
Seems like there 's a lot of songs about getting here , then once you 're here , -LSB- there 's a -RSB- ` Where do you go next ? '
kind of thing . ''
Conor Oberst expanded on his relationship with New York to The Sun newspaper August 1 , 2008 : `` New York 's a funny place .
When you 're there , you 're kinda wrapped up in the city .
It seems like nothing else exists .
It has that feeling of being the center of the universe .
For most people who relocate there from somewhere else , I think there 's a period of a kind of intoxication with the city .
Once that wears off , it maybe loses a little of its luster .
You start thinking ` where do you go from here ? '
I went through a honeymoon period with the place .
I never thought I 'd live anywhere else .
At some point I realized , ` Hey , this is n't for me . '
I still live there , I still pay rent there , but I do n't think I could grow old in New York City . ''
