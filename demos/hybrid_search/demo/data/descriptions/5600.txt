This synth-heavy lament about letting go was released as the first single from Phoenix 's Bankrupt album .
`` I 'd rather be alone , '' frontman Thomas Mars sings in a high-register at the end of the hook .
The track was premiered on Zane Lowe 's BBC Radio 1 show on February 18 , 2013 .
During an on-air interview , Mars called the premiere `` exciting , '' adding , `` This is as connected as we can be . ''
The song uses an Asian riff to explore the idea of the massive rallies held in North Korea .
`` Imagine one individual that is a part of those huge choreographies with over 30,000 participants ... and the sadness and melancholy of the fake smile , '' Brancowitz told Radio.com .
`` That was the idea that we were trying to transcribe . ''
Asked by NME if he knew immediately this would be Bankrupt 's lead single , Thomas Mars replied : `` It kept coming back and we kept rejecting it .
It was either too familiar , too distant or too intrusive .
After spending about a year with it , we managed to see it from a different angle and it became something very different . ''
When Phoenix were writing the song they were thinking of Korea , so the band knew that they wanted to do something about South and North Korea in the video .
Guitarist Laurent Brancowitz told MTV News : .
`` We talked with Patrick Daughters , the video 's director , and he told us about the K-Dramas , the soap operas of Korea ; his mother is a big fan , so he knew them very well .
And so we know we could put all the themes into something more entertaining and pop and Warhol-esque .
We did n't want it to be ironic ; we just wanted to use this particular form of poetry . ''
Asked by Radio.com whether the song is political statement , Brancowitz simply noted with a smile : `` It 's not all political , but everything poetic equals political . ''
