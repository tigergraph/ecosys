Frontman Matt Healy described his lyrics for The 1975 's self-titled debut LP to The Guardian as `` a genuine kind of diary . ''
He added : `` And that 's the thing I 'm really proud of in this album -- it 's me figuring myself out .
Even the line in Heart Out -- ` Your obsession with rocks and brown .
And fu -- ing the whole town ' ... I 'm always talking about me , really . ''
