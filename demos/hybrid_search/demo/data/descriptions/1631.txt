Al Kooper recorded it on his debut solo album I Stand Alone .
This is the album with Al 's face inserted over a photo of the Statue of Liberty - and remember , there was no Photoshop in 1968 !

The press had never had anything to characterize Al Kooper by up until this point , so they latched onto this .
The Statue-of-Liberty photo hacking did n't help .
