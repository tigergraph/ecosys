Jim Morrison was depressed .
He went to Robby Krieger 's house , they went to a canyon to watch a sunset , at which time Jim realized he was depressed because `` if you 're strange , people are strange . ''
He then wrote the rest of the lyrics , which are about feeling alienated .
The Doors played this on their only Ed Sullivan Show appearance .
They also played `` Light My Fire , '' and Sullivan never asked them to come back because Morrison sang the lines , `` Girl we could n't get much higher . ''

Their version , which was featured in the film The Lost Boys , was produced by Ray Manzarek who also plays on the track .
