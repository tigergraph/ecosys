The title track of the fourth studio album studio Lady Antebellum was penned by the trio with Texan-born singer songwriter Eric Paslay .
Lady A 's Charles Kelley said of the record : `` This album feels to me like one of those that from start to finish could be a good road trip record , and that 's what we wanted .
It 's one of the reasons why the term ` golden ' was cool .
I think about road trips and driving down the road with those little streaks of sunshine popping through the trees , especially at sunset .
` Golden ' ... it just gives you this warm , easy feeling .
`` Dave Haywood added that he also sees the album title as a nod to their many musical blessings .
`` We want to value this time in our careers because it 's such a treasure that we can still sit in a room and write songs together , '' said the Lady A guitarist .
`` I personally feel so humbled to still be making records that people are excited to hear . ''
Golden was Lady A 's third album to top the Billboard 200 .
Its placing at the summit was helped by the record being released in the week before Mother 's Day weekend , a time of year where there 's often a sales boost among a demographic that has embraced the trio .
This was the last song that Lady A wrote for the Golden album .
