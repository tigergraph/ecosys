Nicola Roberts was just turning 17 when Girls Aloud first came into the public eye , and initially she struggled with her self-esteem as she was mocked as the `` ugly one '' of the band .
Nicola would often deal with her insecurities by returning to her hometown in the north of England and drinking excessively with her old friends .
In this song we hear her looking back at this difficult time when she was still underage as she begs her driver to buy her vodka : `` How funny that I was too young for so many things / Yet you thought I 'd cope with being told I 'm ugly / Over and over . ''
