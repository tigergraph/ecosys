Rubbernecking is an American word used to describe the act of the voyeuristic interest people take in other people 's difficulties .
It is most frequently used to refer to curious drivers slowing down in order to view the carnage resulting from a traffic accident , which causes even more delay .
The term refers to the turning and stretching of a person 's neck as if it was of rubber in order to get a better view .
This has nothing to do with the Elvis Presley song , `` Rubberneckin ' , '' from his 1969 Memphis sessions .

Milo Cordell of Big Pink explained his fascination with this human trait to Spin magazine : `` Outside of the UK and the US , no one has any idea what the term rubbernecking means .

But it 's just something I 've always been fascinated by -- rubbernecking on the motorway .

I think this song is about rubbernecking within a relationship , looking back at things that have happened before when you 've got a good thing going and should be facing forward .
But there 's that what-if , and you 've spent so long looking backwards that you 're lost and you 've missed what was in front of you . ''
A 2003 study discovered that rubbernecking was the cause of 16 percent of distraction-related traffic accidents .
