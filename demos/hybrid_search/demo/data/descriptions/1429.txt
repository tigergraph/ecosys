Doves ' Jimi Goodwin explained to Spinner UK the The Places Between : The Best of Doves album title .
`` It 's inspired by a book by Rory Stewart , The Places In Between , it just seems to fit because it bookends this part of our life .
It 's closing the last 12 years .
We 've all read his story now , it 's an inspiring journey this guy did after the invasion of Afghanistan .
He traveled on his own from village to village .
The guy 's got balls . ''
Andalucia -LRB- sometimes known as Andalusia -RRB- is the name of a fertile autonomous region of southern Spain .
Much of Doves body of work is an ode to the north of England but in this song it appears they are singing of warmer pastures .
