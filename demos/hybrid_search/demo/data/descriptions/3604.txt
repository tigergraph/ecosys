Having mentioned British TV star Michaela Strachan , Elvis Presley and James Bond on their self-titled debut album , this track name-checks three Hollywood greats .
Vocalist Roy Stride told the Sunday Mail January 10 , 2010 : `` The album has a song called ` Famous , ' which is a celebration of reality television and pop culture .
In the song , we mention James Dean , Audrey Hepburn and Bette Davis .
The line is , ` Forget Audrey Hepburn , forget Bette Davis .
I want to be known just for being famous . ' ''
