Towards the end of the track , Spektor can be heard barking like a dolphin .
She told The Sunday Times : `` It came really readily .
It 's almost like my body had been waiting to do that its whole life - my inner dolphin . ''
Jeff Lynne produced this song , along with `` Genius Next Door '' `` Blue Lips '' and `` Wallet '' on Far .
Lynne 's CV includes work with Paul McCartney , George Harrison , Bob Dylan , Roy Orbison and , E.L.O. .
However when Spektor approached Lynne , she admitted to Rolling Stone that she was n't familiar with his résumé .
She said : `` I loved Tom Petty 's last record .
Everyone was like , ` He 's done some other things . ' ''
