According to Chuck Berry 's autobiography , `` Down Bound Train '' was inspired by Berry 's fire and brimstone religious upbringing ; both his parents were staunch Baptists , and sang in the Antioch Church Choir , which rehearsed at his home .
It is a song about redemption and a warning against alcohol abuse .
A man who has too much to drink falls asleep on a bar room floor and has a vivid dream about riding a train .
The train , which is driven by the Devil himself , contains an eclectic mix of people he knows , foreigners , rich and poor .
When the man wakes up he renounces the demon drink .
The message is that anyone from any background can be afflicted by drink - or by some other vice or sin - but we can all choose to be saved .
`` Down Bound Train '' was released in December 1955 as the B Side of `` No Money Down . ''
The title is sometimes given as `` The Down Bound Train '' or `` Downbound Train . ''
