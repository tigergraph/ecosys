Peace vocalist Harrison Koisser was inspired by the American Psychedelic-Electronic music duo Silver Apples for this song .
He told NME : `` I decided to write something we could really expand on live .
I like the flower-power riff that comes in halfway .
That was n't existent until we 'd finished the song and I was doing chord overdubs on a 12-string , and it just ... happened . ''
