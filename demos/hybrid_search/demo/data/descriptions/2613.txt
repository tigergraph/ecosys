Toby Keith explained his songwriting partner Bobby Pinson 's contribution to this power ballad about an old flame .
`` This is one I had and threw on Bobby , '' he said .
`` When I explained it to him it was kind of like a puppy looking at you going , ` Huh ? '
So I kept explaining about how I missed you at my sister 's wedding and all these other examples .
Finally , here comes Bobby with , ' I missed you on your weekend whiskey . '
You do n't get the feeling the guy 's being an ass .
It 's not a slam at all .
He had his feelings , but it all worked out the way it 's supposed to .
He 's very happy and fortunate to be where he is , but he 's nice about it . ''
