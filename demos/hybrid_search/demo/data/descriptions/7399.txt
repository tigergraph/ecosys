The message of this song is to fight through adversity .
It reminds you to be careful around what you think is good -LRB- `` In the sweetest child there 's a vicious streak '' -RRB- and to look for the good in everything -LRB- `` In the shakiest will there 's a core of steel '' -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , Nicky - Red Deer , AB -RRB-
