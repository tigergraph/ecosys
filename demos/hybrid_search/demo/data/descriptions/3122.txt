Among the biggest hits on their résumé is Dierk Bentley 's country # 1 , `` Feel That Fire . ''
The two brothers wrote this song for the 2010 movie Letters to God .
Brett Warren told The Boot about it : `` We tried to be honest when writing this song .
If we were writing a letter to God , what would we really say to Him ?
A lot of faith-based songs are about ` we worship you , ' and it misses people .
I wanted to write it from the standpoint if you were not raised in church and just believed in God .
If you were basically going to sit down and ask Him some honest questions and be real honest with Him , what would you say?One of my favorite parts of the song is in the chorus .
It says ` I 'm all right , but I ca n't lie . '
No one ever brings it up , but I love the fact that we said ' I ca n't lie ' in a letter to God .
That 's something I thought was kind of funny .
It 's a little behind-the-scenes humor .
Every time I hear it I 'm laughing and thinking nobody thinks that 's funny but me ?
You 're writing a letter to God and you say ' I ca n't lie . '
Well no kidding !
You 're talking to God !
He knows if you 're lying . ''
