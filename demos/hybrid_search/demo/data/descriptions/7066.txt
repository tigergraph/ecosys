During hours of downtime on her Acid Tongue world tour , Rilo Kiley vocalist Jenny Lewis and her boyfriend and songwriting partner Johnathan Rice began writing a batch of songs different from anything they had previously created .
They were so happy with the results that Lewis and Rice decided to start a brand new band and record a record with the help of their producer friend , Mike Mogis .
I 'm Having Fun Now was recorded at Mogis ' ARC studios in Omaha , Nebraska during the worst Midwestern winter since the 1860 's .
This breezy power-pop duet about catching a red-eye flight home to see a lover was released as the lead single from the album .
The song was inspired by an incident when Jenny started hurtling at Johnny with scissor blades bared .
Johnny told NME : `` She has a very aggressive approach to home decorating that borders on the murderous . ''
Lewis explained the album title to Spin magazine : `` Johnathan needed to buy a car so we went to an estate sale near our house .
There was a 1977 Mazda station wagon for sale for $ 850 and we knew that Johnathan had to buy it .
On the back of the car was a bumper sticker that said , `` I 'm having fun now . ''
We drove it around for a bit , but Johnathan ended up selling it to his friend .
His friend got a bunch of tickets and the car was impounded and crushed into a cube .
Cut to a couple months ago .
We were driving around as we often do , and there was another turquoise station wagon for sale on the side of the road for $ 950 .
We knew at that point , having lost the other one , that we needed to buy the car and re-live the fantasy .
We remade the bumper sticker and it became the title of our album . ''
