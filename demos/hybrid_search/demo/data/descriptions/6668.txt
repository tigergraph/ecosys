This is a cover of a song by Nashville singer-songwriter Julie Miller .
Lambert explained why she recorded it : `` I heard it on Buddy and Julie Miller 's record .
You could easily soak up every inch of everything they ever sing .
And I thought that this song would be fun to sing live .
I play a lot of live shows , and I always think , I want to make sure I put some songs on here that are gon na be awesome to play live .
That 's one of them , definitely . ''
