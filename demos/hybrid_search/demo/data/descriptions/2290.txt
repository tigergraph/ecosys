This was the very first single ever released by Red Hot Chili Peppers .
The song -LRB- like the rest of the album -RRB- was produced by former Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill .
The song is a good example of the Punk/Funk sound the band developed .
They found a home on college radio and developed a loyal fanbase as each album saw increasing sales , with their fifth release , Blood Sugar Sex Magik , selling about 12 million copies as they crossed over to a mainstream audience .
The band made a video for this song , which showed them shirtless and spastic , a look they would use for many years .
