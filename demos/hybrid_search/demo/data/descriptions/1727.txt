After being dropped by Warner after falling out with them , the Futureheads set up their own record label .
This was one of the first songs that they wrote for their first release on Nul Records .
The former Killing Joke bassist Martin `` Youth '' Glover produced this song along with the rest of the album .
Youth is best known for his production work on The Verve 's 1997 album Urban Hymns , including the hit singles `` Bittersweet Symphony '' and `` The Drugs Do n't Work . ''
Hyde told the BBC about working with him : `` Youth is a fantastic producer .
I find that producers have very different methods of working , but Youth 's main goal from a session is to get the musicians in the right frame of mind - the frame of mind to be creative .
Some producers , their art relies on technology , expensive microphones and technical ability , whereas Youth is almost like a priest !
-LSB- He laughs -RSB- He makes you remember what music is about and he has an amazing way of tapping into an essence of a song . ''
Frontman Barry Hyde explained to the BBC why they named their album after this song .
He said : `` Thinking of names for albums tends to be either very easy or very , very difficult .
If you name your album after something completely unconnected , there 's a chance that people will question that .
But the song , This Is Not The World , is to me quite an important song .
It 's one of the first songs we wrote after we split from Warner .
That happening is possibly the most important thing that has ever happened to this band .
We 'd still be signed to Warner and we would n't have made this album .
I was n't even willing to write any more songs for Warner to be honest with you .
I was just going to do a Lou Reed Metal Machine music and deliver them an album of white noise and say , ` Release that .
See if you can do any better with this ! ' ''
