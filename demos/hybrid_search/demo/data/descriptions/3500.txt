In an interview with The New York Times , lead singer Gerard Way said , `` At first I thought the patient died , but the more I think about it , the more I think he 's not dead .
Maybe this is all in his head .
Maybe he can fight .
Now I think he has a choice to live . ''
The `` Patient '' is the main character of the album .
The last lines of the song imply that the patient 's lover is in fact the person who has died .
`` I see you lying next to me with words I thought I 'd never speak '' suggests that the Patient 's lover is lying next to him in a coffin , as he speaks about her during the funeral service .
The line `` Awake and unafraid , asleep or dead '' is further evidence that the Patient is alive and has entered into some new state of self-perception , that he has cleared himself of regrets .
However there is no mention of the Patient 's state ; whether he has recovered from his illness or not .
Though the song is named `` Famous Last Words '' , that term is generally used when someone has died , and they have said their Famous Last Words .
-LRB- thanks , Amanda - San Diego , CA , for all above -RRB- Gerard Way also said in an interview with Kerrang !
magazine that the line , `` I am not afraid to walk this world alone '' played some part in the break up with his then girlfriend , known as `` Katmandu . ''
On the `` Black Parade '' single the band talks about each song .
Ray says that it `` sums up the whole CD , it relays the message : live everyday like its their last , live life to the fullest and really enjoy it ... the song has the most inspiring lyrics , the chorus makes me want to wake up in the morning and have a great day ... its very powerful . ''
Gerard says , `` It 's one of the most emotionally powerful songs on the record , its extremely difficult subject to talk about , its hard to explain , its one of those songs that you just have to hit play and hope they understand ... it 's really just about saying I can do this alone , sometimes I just have to be strong and I can make it , I wan na live .
