This Euro-ready feel-good party anthem finds Minaj singing about the automatic way a body moves on the dance floor .
`` I ca n't control the way I 'm moving hips , bet you never ever seen it like this , I 'm a monster on the floor I ca n't quit , '' she sings .
The lyric , `` falling like a domino , '' is not the first time that Minaj has referenced the toppling of the collective gaming pieces .
The song `` Girls Fall Like Dominoes '' was a track on the UK edition of her debut album , Pink Friday .
