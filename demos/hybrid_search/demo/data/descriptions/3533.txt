Two days after bassist Paolo Gregoletto told his Twitter followers to tweet to Roadrunner Records to release this song , it was made available exclusively to TriviumWorld members .
A day later , on June 29 , 2011 it was released to the official Trivium YouTube page .
Vocalist Matt Heafy told Alternative Press the story of the song : '' ` Dusk ' is a song whose final lyrics were n't fully realized until shortly before the recording process .
This song came from the ashes of several other songs of the collective In Waves bunch -- up to 40 songs at one point -- and ended up being one of the most intense songs on the album . ''
