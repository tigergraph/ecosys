Guitarist Benji Madden explained this song 's meaning to Alternative Press : `` This song is a love letter to our fans in a way .
The GCFAM always stuck by us .
After some time away and some thinking for better or for worse , the GCFAM sticks with us through thick and thin .
Even if we do n't always agree on everything , Good Charlotte and our fans are for life -- and we were counting the days till we could be back with them and bring them new music . ''
