This is the second single by English recording artist Pixie Lott from the re-released edition of her debut studio album , titled Turn It Up Louder .
The song is a duet with American pop singer Jason Derulo .
Derulo told The Daily Star about the track : `` It 's about not always having enough time to spend with your loved one - but tonight she 'll have me all to herself .
I think people are going to connect with it.I think our voices blended together in the studio but I gave Pixie a few more vocals on the record as it 's her song , too . ''
