This was Godsmack 's first single .
The band got a lot of exposure when a disc jockey at WAAF , a radio station in Massachusetts , started playing this on his show .
Godsmack had a following from their club shows , but had never gotten airplay before .
Lead singer Sully Erna and guitarist Tony Rambola wrote this .
Rambola : `` That 's Sully 's answer to his girlfriend when we were going through the whole struggle between rehearsing five nights a week , playing on the weekends and trying to keep a relationship going at the same time .
We were really starting to take off , and it 's hard to go through a relationship with a girl and have a band take all your time , plus we worked regular jobs , so there was probably 10 minutes of the day for them . ''
-LRB- thanks , Nick - Paramus , NJ -RRB- This was the longest-running song on the US Active Rock Top 10 chart .
It was there for 33 weeks .
Godsmack 's record company did n't think this album needed an explicit content warning sticker , so it shipped without one .
Since it did n't have the sticker , Wal-Mart and K-Mart both carried it , but they pulled the album after some customers complained that it was offensive .
