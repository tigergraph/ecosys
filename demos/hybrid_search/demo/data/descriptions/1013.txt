Producer Stuart Price told Electronic Beats magazine : `` I think ` Inside A Dream ' is one of those tracks where the music sounds like the title .
The music sounds like you paint it and you put it together with that in mind .
And it begins and ends with these , I feel like they 're sort of kinda deep house sections . ''
The song features handclaps by Adam Blake , who is Stuart Price 's bandmate in the British electronic music group Zoot Woman .
The reoccurring couplet `` The Land of Dreams is better far .
Above the light of the Morning Star '' is a direct quotation from William Blake 's 1803 poem The Land of Dreams .
The words are spoken by a little boy to his father at the end of the poem .
The little boy 's mother had passed away and he sees her in his dreams .
