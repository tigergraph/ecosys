Johnny Marr , who plays guitar on the song , wrote the music , intending for it to be a song for The Smiths .
Unfortunately , The Smiths disbanded before Morrissey could write lyrics for the melody .
As a result , Bryan Ferry ended up putting words to the melody and putting it on his Bete Noire album .
