Jack White said in NME magazine : `` I 'm jealous of how Rap and Hip-Hop lyrics can get away with a lot more metaphors than the world I come from is allowed to get away with .
The character in this song is bragging , but it 's also self-depreciating at the same time . ''
The song finds White virtually rapping the lyrics .
He told UK newspaper The Sun : `` If I 'd sat down and said I wanted the delivery of a Hip-Hop artist , I might not have succeeded .
It just came out subconsciously .
The White Stripes song ` Icky Thump ' -- ` Icky thump with a lump ' -- also sounds very much like a rap . ''
The song features some stand out piano playing by Nashville-based singer-songwriter Brooke Waggoner .
Brooke won the Nashville Music Award for `` NBN Emerging Artist '' of the year in the fall of 2009 and her songs have been featured in TV shows such as Grey 's Anatomy and Ghost Whisperer .
White explained the song 's meaning to The Sun : `` I was thinking about Jay-Z and Kanye West and the freedom of expression they have that I do n't have , '' he said .
`` It 's about a character singing , -LRB- breaks into a rap -RRB- ` No one can blow the shows or throw the bones that break your nose like I can ' .
I was trying to make that statement braggadocious and self-effacing at the same time . ''
