Hunter originally recorded this ballad for his self-titled debut album .
It was the only song on the set that he penned without any outside help .
Hayes revisited the song for the Encore edition of the album , this time enlisting Ashley Monroe of The Pistol Annies to share the mic with him .
`` I recorded that song 20 times , '' he told Radio.com .
`` I was out of ideas and I needed something else .
Something to re-inspire it .
I think she brought in exactly what I needed : a different perspective .
There 's something about the way she sings it that gives it a different meaning .
It gives it a different texture and it reinvented the song . ''
