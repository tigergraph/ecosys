This future-retro pop-dance cut is the first single from British electro pop musician Frankmusik -LRB- birth name Vincent Turner -RRB- 's second album , Do It In The AM . ''
` The Fear Inside ' is a song about relieving the pressures and complications of the modern world through the strength of a close and intimate relationship , '' he explained to Billboard magazine .
`` And it was n't too bad getting to show that with Natalie Loren -LSB- the lead actress -RSB- in the video . ''
Frankmusik explained the meaning behind the album title to Billboard magazine : `` The AM was the time in which most of the body of work was created .
Every sunrise of the past year meant much more than a new day .
It felt like every day was a moment closer to remembering why I was making musik again . ''
