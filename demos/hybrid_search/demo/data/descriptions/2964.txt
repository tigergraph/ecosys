This heartfelt ballad written by Phillip White and Steven Dale Jones tells of a father 's dedication and devotion to his children .
Turner told AOL 's The Boot that the song puts a lump in his throat .
`` I do n't know if it 's a song that I 'm going to be able to pull off live every night , just because it just hits close to home , '' he said .
`` It makes me think about myself as a daddy , and when I 'm up on stage that 's the furthest thing from my mind because I try to separate the two .
When I 'm up on stage , I 'm thinking more about my fans and about myself as a singer and an artist .
When I 'm at home being a daddy , the last thing I 'm thinking about is being an artist .
It is two things that I never really put together . ''
Turner told CMT : `` That was written by Steven Dale Jones and Phillip White .
I 'm a big fan of theirs .
Steven has kind of an interesting style of writing .
He 's one of the guys who really writes from the heart , whether you like it or not .
He 's not out there trying to write this typical manufactured kind of stuff .
He 's really writing stuff that means something .
And so he wrote it about his son .
When I heard it , I could just tell it was a genuinely-written song . ''
