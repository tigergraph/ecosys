The song is about The Simpsons character Ralph Wiggum .
The entire song is mostly quotes from him except for the lines `` Ralphie get off the stage sweetheart '' and the infamous `` Yvan eht nioj , '' which is `` Join The Navy '' backwards .
This line comes from the Simpsons episode `` New Kids On The Blecch , '' where it is a subversive lyric in a song .
