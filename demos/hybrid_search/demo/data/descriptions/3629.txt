English Alternative Rock band Muse open their sixth studio album The 2nd Law with this song , in which they foresee the collapse of industrial civilization .
Matt Bellamy sings of a terrifying scene of mankind losing its supremacy over the Earth as the risen seas and energy shortages create global desperation .
The themes of The 2nd Law were inspired by a BBC broadcast that Bellamy saw in 2011 , where a panelist noted that `` The laws of physics say that an economy based on endless growth is unsustainable . ''
Muse opened the 2013 BRIT Awards with a typically epic rendition of this song , involving an orchestra , choir , pyrotechnics and lasers .
The band was said to have spent in excess of # 300,000 on their performance .
Muse thought this could be a candidate for the Skyfall Bond theme tune , until they heard that Adele was recording it .
Drummer Dom Howard told the BBC : `` It 's got a little whisper to the Bond vibe - it all goes a bit crazy ` Live and Let Die ' in the middle .
My view is they should use it for the next James Bond film , but I do n't know what 's going on with that .
I heard Adele was doing it ! ''
The song was n't originally the band 's choice to open The 2nd Law .
Bassist Chris Wolstenholme explained to Kerrang !
: `` We thought ` Survival ' might be a good opener but with the whole Olympics thing we thought it might be better using something that was n't already familiar to people .
` The 2nd Law : Unsustainable ' was another contender , but in the end we decided ` Supremacy ' would be the best choice .
There are a lot of experiments on this album , and I think this is one of the few songs where as soon as you hear it you know it 's us .
It could n't really be anyone else and I think that 's why it works so well . ''
