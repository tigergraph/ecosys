Not only does Asher Roth share the same shade of melanin with Eminem , but also his speedy , precise rapping style have caused many to compare him with his fellow Caucasian artist .
On this song Roth addresses the comparisons .
He told Complex magazine : `` Him and I are different artists .
I think the music 's going to portray that as time goes on .
It 's cool to be compared to Em , but he 's one of the number one selling artists of all time .
I 'd rather be compared to him than pretty much anybody else .
I think content and everything we rap about is completely different .
We 're different artists .
We just happened to be under the same genre . ''
This samples the theme from the TV show Action Jackson .
