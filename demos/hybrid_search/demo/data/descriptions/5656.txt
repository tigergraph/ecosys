Lewis Carroll 's Victorian literary nonsense novel Alice 's Adventure 's In Wonderland was an influence on Amnesiac .
In particular the nightmarish sequence where Alice arrived in a hall of locked doors inspired this song .
Thom Yorke said : `` Revolving Doors for example , is something that happened in my brain where ... Like , Alice in Wonderland .
Where she walks down the corridor and there are lots of different doors .
I was sort of in that corridor , mentally for 6 months .
And that was an extremely central part , for me , what I was writing .
` Cos every door I opened , it was like , dreading opening it .
` Cos I did n't know what was gon na happen next .
See , that makes perfect sense ! ''
