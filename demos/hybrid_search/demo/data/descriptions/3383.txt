When in April 2009 , he was asked by Jools Holland on the BBC TV Later programme what had inspired him to write this song , Yusuf would say only that it was a story and that it would soon become clear .
`` The Rain '' was no April shower but the Biblical Flood .
Cat Stevens converted to Islam and gave up music ; twenty-eight years later he returned as Yusuf Islam ; his second album - as Yusuf - followed relatively quickly , and without proselytising he managed to combine his music and his religion .
