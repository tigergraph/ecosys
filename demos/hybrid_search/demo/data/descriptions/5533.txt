This eerily restrained contemplative ballad finds Cave crooning about charred trees standing like `` pleading hands '' as we live with the consequences of modern day progress .
Asked by The Guardian about the text speak title , Cave replied , musing , `` Texting is apocalyptic on some level .
It 's a reduction of things .
Maybe the last book , the last thing that ever gets written is just a bye , you know , goodbye in text speak . ''
