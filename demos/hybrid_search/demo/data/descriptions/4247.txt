The lead single from Foals ' third LP , Holy Fire , is a track about claustrophobia that was described in a statement as `` heavier than anything Foals have written before . ''
The album was helmed by production duo Flood & Moulder -LRB- PJ Harvey , Smashing Pumpkins , The Killers -RRB- at Assault and Battery studios in London .
The song was inspired by the guilt Yannis feels about the damage caused by smoking to the lungs that his ancestors have given him .
He explained to Q magazine that he ca n't shake off the feeling that his potency as a young man has been wasted .
`` You get given these organs , '' he said , `` and I 've just been desecrating everything since the age of 12 . ''
This won Best Track at the 2013 NME Awards .
It was the second time a Foals song has won that honor as `` Spanish Sahara '' took the prize at the 2010 NME awards .
The song 's music video was directed by Foals ' frequent collaborator Dave Ma and features artwork from Tinhead .
Philippakis told NME regarding the clip : `` Most of the people in it are just mates of ours from Oxford - this self-destructive skater crew .
We decided to harness their power and arm them with fireworks .
We let them loose in an abandoned swimming pool outside our local hospital . ''
Vocalist Yannis Philippakis explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` It 's about feeling under attack .
I tapped into that feeling of rush-hour claustrophobia , wanting to scream everybody away and gain space for myself .
On a more personal level it 's about wanting to push away at people and at everything . ''
The song was written by the band on tour .
Guitarist Jimmy Smith recalled to Consequence of Sound : `` When we used to play ` Miami ' live , we used to do like a two-minute jam afterwards , and that 's kind of where the beginning of ` Inhaler ' came from .
That 's where we discovered the groove for that song .
And then Yannis would have this fat riff lying around and would be like , ` Hey , check this out . '
It just came from that . ''
Philippakis told NME the song was titled ` Inhaler ' as he is `` asthmatic . ''
