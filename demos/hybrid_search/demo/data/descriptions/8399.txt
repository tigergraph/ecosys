Written by the band while they were on tour , Michael Stipe explained in the October , 1992 issue of Q magazine : '' -LRB- It 's -RRB- about a mother and child , especially the strong bond that exists between them .
The voice is neither hers nor the child 's , however .
It 's someone else commenting on the sense that the bond between a mother and child is the most powerful love of all ... I think it 's significant to state that it 's not a song about defenestration .
I took great pains to clarify that in the vocal .
There 's an event that 's occurred somewhere far away that has come to the attention of the woman who 's the protagonist of the song , and she realizes how significant that thing is to her child and herself , and she goes to the window to take a breath .
I think that when I first wrote the song , it did seem like the woman hurled herself and her child out of the window , but that 's not what occurs . ''
