Leader/vocalist Dave King told Lords of Metal about this song , which deals with getting older : `` I still try to be positive about things .
It 's about not to knock down the things that you 've build .
Right now , I 'm doing okay and things are gon na be better , but it has n't always been that way . ''
In the same Lords of Metal interview King explained why they recorded the album in Ireland : `` Bridget -LSB- the violin player and girlfriend of King -RSB- and me are back to Ireland since two years and we were talking about where we gon na record the new album and it seems pretty obvious , since two of us were already in Ireland , that we gon na do the album over here .
So we got the rest of the band over and started working here in Ireland .
We found a great studio in the middle of Ireland , in County Westmeath , called Grouse Lodge and started to work on the album there .
It was great , because everybody was at the right place at the right time .
We did a track a day .
We started of with a backing track in the morning and then we finished that song by the end of the day , which was about three or four in the morning .
And then we recorded another song the next day .
We 've never done it like this before .
It kept us very focused and we felt it was a very good way of recording the songs . ''
