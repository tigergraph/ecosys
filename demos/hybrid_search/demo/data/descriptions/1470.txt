GRB stands for `` Gamma-Ray Burst , '' and GRB 09042 is a specific burst that was discovered by University of Exeter astrophysicists in 2009 .
The Limousines lead singer/lyricist Eric Victorino used the celestial event as a metaphor for desolation .
`` Sometimes giving up feels like the only option , '' he told us .
`` GRB09042 is the furthest point of light that we can see .
It 's completely out if reach . ''
The duo 's instrumentalist Giovanni Giusti handles lead vocals on this song .
The higher voice that comes in midway through is that of their frontman Eric Victorino .
Hush was the second Limousines album , and it saw the band taking a far more introspective approach , as they had gone through some dark times leading up to it : the duo lost some friends and family members , and Victorino was committed to a psychiatric facility .
`` Hush came from an emotional place , '' he said .
`` Get Sharp -LSB- their first album -RSB- was written from a snarky kind of sarcastic angle with almost no emotional investment . ''
