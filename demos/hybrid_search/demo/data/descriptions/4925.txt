This one is about a girl - the girl Marcy Playground lead singer John Wozniak had an affair with .
The girl that came between him and Raine , the woman he would later marry .
In our interview with John Wozniak , he explained : `` We broke up because I had a relationship with another girl .
Yeah , I cheated on Raine .
And this other girl turned out to be the biggest mistake of my life .
But I thought I was in love at the time .
And I was wrong .
I just really was infatuated , is what it was .
And Raine took me back after some time .
-LRB- laughing -RRB- After a lot of penance paid .
Yeah , and I wrote that song about that .
` Blackbird ' is , as my mom would call her , ` the girl with the dancing eyes . '
That 's what my mother would say . ''
So who is the `` Blackbird '' ?
Wozniak says : `` Well , it 's hard to explain without going into who the girl was , which I do n't intend to do , because she is a known person .
That 's one thing I always promised , nobody would ever know who it was . ''
He adds that the song is a thank you to Raine for taking it all away .
