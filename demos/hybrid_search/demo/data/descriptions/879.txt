Courtney wrote this song for her daughter Frances Bean .
The lines , `` I 'll protect you from the truth , you wo n't hear it at all '' mean that Courtney does n't want Frances to know there are rumors that her mother killed her father , Kurt Cobain .
Courtney is promising something to her daughter ; she had lots of drug problems and in 2004 Frances Bean had to live with Kurt 's mother while Courtney cleaned up .
