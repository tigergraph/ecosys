Bugg recalled writing this tune in a track by track video : `` I was n't too keen on the actual song but when I heard it finished , then it became something else , '' he said .
`` I wanted that country kind of vibe .
What it was , was I had ` Lightning Bolt ' and I had ` Two Fingers ' and I felt it needed to be a tune , a crossover song , so I came up with ` Taste It . ' ''
