Like the rest of the album , `` Tarot Woman '' is a Ritchie Blackmore/Ronnie James Dio composition .
According to Roy Davies in Rainbow Rising : The Story of Ritchie Blackmore 's Rainbow , then lead vocalist Ronnie James Dio said of this song : `` It was originally called something else ... the main character is told by this tarot woman that a chick is going to f -- k him over ; she tells him to beware a smile and a bright shiny face .
`` The opening track on the Rising album runs to a shade over 6 minutes and features some fine keyboard work from Tony Carey - Rainbow was never an ego trip for Ritchie Blackmore .
