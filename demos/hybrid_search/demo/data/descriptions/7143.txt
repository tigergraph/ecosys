The Seattle Post-Intelligencer asked Jackson if this was autobiographical in the light of his wife Denise Jackson 's best-selling book -LRB- It 's All About Him : Finding the Love of My Life -RRB- , in which she revealed that her Christian faith had helped save a marriage gone astray .

It made it much easier to write because I 've been through a lot of that .
But I did n't sit down and necessarily put it together for that reason . ''
