English singer-songwriter Jodie Connor released this club track as her second single release .
The song was produced by David Dawood , who previously helmed the former Pop Idol contestant 's # 1 hit with Roll Deep , `` Good Times . ''
The song features rapper Tinchy Stryder .
The pair previously had success collaborating on Stryder 's 2010 single , `` In My System , '' which featured Connor .
The Manchurian singer told Digital Spy why she hooked up with the London MC for this song : `` I 've worked with him before and we 're signed to the same management so we 've crossed paths quite a lot in the last 12 months .
I treat him more like a friend now , so it was really good working with him again . ''
Connor explained the song 's meaning to Digital Spy : `` Basically it 's just a feel good song .
When I wrote it I did n't really have anything in mind .
It was n't really personal to me , but I thought the music was really uplifting and needed the powerful lyrics to go with it .
It 's about getting back up and showing people what you 're made of - do n't let anyone knock you down .
If you 've done it once then you can do it again . ''
