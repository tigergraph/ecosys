On The Hazards of Love , the Decemberists are joined by guest vocalists including Lavender Diamond 's Becky Stark , who sings on this song and Morning Jacket 's Jim James .
Decemberists ' frontman Colin Meloy explained to Rolling Stone : `` I wanted to have different voices singing different songs , so it would be like a fake musical . ''
The A.V.Club asked Meloy if he wrote the songs for the females who guested on the album in their voice ranges .
He replied : `` Well , I did n't know their ranges well enough , and having never written for women before , it was all really guesswork , just assuming they were gon na have a far superior range than mine .
So the two songs Becky sings , I actually wrote in my own range , because I was still writing for myself . ''
Meloy added : `` Working with the girls was kind of a huge question mark from the beginning .
I do n't think we had a real strong idea about how it was gon na sound , or even if -- I think Becky , when we sent over the song , said ` Oh yeah , I can do that . '
And we thought ` Okay , ' just assuming she could , but there were some notes that were super-high , and at some point before she flew out , just to make sure , we had to take out a Lavender Diamond record and look for the highest note we could find her singing , just to make sure she would be able to do it .
And we discovered that she could , no problem .
That was definitely a challenge . ''
