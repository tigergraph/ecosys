This dreamy ballad with an utopian outlook about finding peace was originally began as a Muppets collaboration .
Frontman Jim James explained to UK newspaper The Sun what happened : `` We were going to write new music for the Muppets ' band The Electric Mayhem but the guy who dreamed up the project at Disney got fired and the guy who took his place let the whole thing drop off the face of the earth .
It 's hard to have much control in a giant corporate world like Disney so the project was lost . ''
Another Circuital track , `` Outta My System , '' was also originally penned for the same aborted project .
