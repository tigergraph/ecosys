Saadiq explained on his record label 's website that this song showed his deep connection to The Temptations .
He explained : `` The vocal has a David Ruffin ` feel ' : I pictured how it was when Eddie Kendricks , Paul Williams and the guys in the Temps were first introduced to the world .
I looked at a lot of their album covers so I could immerse myself in the characters .
I think of the track as vintage Motown with a Stax guitar line factored in ... it 's like a melting pot of the two sounds . ''
Veteran Motown percussionist Jack Ashford played on this track .
Saadiq recalled to The Guardian April 24 , 2009 : `` Jack played the bells .
He was supposed to play a different line , but he did his own thing , and it was magical .
When you 've got a veteran in the room , you do n't say anything . ''
