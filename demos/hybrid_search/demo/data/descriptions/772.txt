Perhaps first generation riot grrrl band Bratmobile 's most popular track from their 2000 album Ladies , Women and Girls , `` Gim me Brains , '' is one of the band 's most empowering songs - with shout-able lyrics and a defiant swagger the lyrics proclaim , `` a boy is good for nothing , ca n't give you nothing / I 'm sick of nothing . ''
The song is ostensibly about jilting `` all the f -- kin ' boys / in the f -- kin ' bands , '' but is , on a deeper level , about the implications of romance within a radical and feminist framework .
As vocalist for the band , Allison Wolfe said in an interview with Perfect Sound Forever , this , and a few other Bratmobile songs are about , `` how girls go out with a guy in a band and they think that 's cool , but really the guy is a jerk .
You have to become your own punk rock dream come true .
You need to respect yourself and be your own star . ''
`` Gim me Brains '' has the melodics of a pop song , underscoring the clever joke of the refrain that begs , `` gim me brains for breakfast , baby / gim me more for lunch '' and on , asserting not only a joking vengeful violence but also the desire for a thoughtful male lover .
This standout track is featured on Ladies , Women and Girls , the band 's second studio album , recorded after a six year hiatus .
Bratmobile was a highly influential riot grrrl band formally finding its start in Washington DC , but with most members hailing from and residing in Olympia , Washington .
The band 's first show was in the winter of 1991 in Olympia .
The band released three full length , studio albums , one EP , and a number of split 7 '' with a handful of admired punk bands .
The band broke up in 1996 , reuniting again in 2000 before amicably parting ways in 2004 .
