This slice of neo-psychedelia finds Bowie lamenting a shellshocked war veteran .
Producer Tony Visconti explained to Rolling Stone : '' ` I 'd Rather Be High ' is about a soldier who 's come out of the war and he 's just burnt out , and rather than becoming a human being again , I think he laments , ` I 'd rather be high .
I do n't want to know .
I 'm trying to erase these thoughts from my mind . ''
Bowie sings a new version of this song in an renaissance-inspired advert for French fashion house Louis Vuitton .
The short film , which is titled L'Invitation Au Voyage , stars American fashion model Arizona Muse and is directed by Romain Gavras , the man behind the clips for M.I.A. 's `` Born Free '' and `` Bad Girls '' plus Kanye West and Jay-Z 's `` No Church in The Wild . ''
The desert setting suggests contemporary conflict , as the poor beaten up combatant curses his situation .
`` I 'd rather be flying , '' sings Bowie , `` I 'd rather be dead , than out of my head and training these guns on those men in the sand . ''
English creative director and graphic designer Tom Hingston directed the video for the song 's Venetian Mix , which appears on the expanded release , The Next Day Extra .
The anti-war clip pairs vintage footage of wartime battle and celebration with close up shots of Bowie 's distorted face .
Hingston 's London-based design studio has worked with a number of artists , including include Massive Attack , Lady Gaga and The Rolling Stones .
Hingston explained the thinking behind the video : `` In early conversations , Mr. Bowie and I discussed exploring archival footage that brought to life another side of war - footage that featured soldiers celebrating ; young servicemen and women , in moments of jubilation - drinking , dancing and partying , '' he said .
`` These moments of total euphoria , juxtaposed with extreme violence , hopefully serve as a powerful reminder of the futility of war . ''
