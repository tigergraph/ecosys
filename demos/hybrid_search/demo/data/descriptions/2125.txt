In his autobiography , Adam Ant said `` Here Comes The Grump '' is autobiographical ; a manic depressive , he attempted suicide in his 20s , and in 2002 he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.With his group Adam & the Ants , he had two UK # 1 hits , `` Stand and Deliver '' and `` Prince Charming , '' but as he points out in this song , the only place to go when you 're # 1 is down .
Ant had a hard time enjoying his success , even when the Friend Or Foe album produced yet another chart-toppper : `` Goody Two Shoes . ''
Running to 3 minutes 33 seconds and co-written with guitarist Marco Pirroni , `` Here Comes The Grump '' is the fifth track on the 1982 Friend Or Foe album .
