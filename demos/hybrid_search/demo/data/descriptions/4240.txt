Dobson wrote this song with Jon Levine , who is a singer/songwriter best known as keyboardist and primary songwriter for the Canadian band Philosopher Kings .
Dobson explained in an interview with the Canadian telecommunications company Telus why this is the most meaningful track on Joy for her : `` Set Me Free is definitely the most meaningful to me .
It 's one of the first songs I did and it was very therapeutic for me .
It was as if I had pleaded to be freed from all the negative things , the invisible things which imprison me .
I wanted to be released by writing this song . ''
