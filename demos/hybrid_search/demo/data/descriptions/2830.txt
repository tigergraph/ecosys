This originated from the same jam that also produced `` Love Is Noise . ''
Bassist Simon Jones explained in an interview with BBC DJ Steve Lamacq : `` I absolutely love that track and it 's where ` Love is Noise ' has come from and I think it 's a good insight for people to listen to .
They can listen to that track and maybe not relate it to ` Love is Noise ' but at some point they will realize that , they go together like that , you know , it 's two songs .
We got two songs out of this beautiful jam and for people to be able to understand that process and see it , I think that 's fantastic .
It 's a great , I mean , it 's an out there piece of music .
I ca n't explain what it is .
To me , I do n't know , it sounds like something off a soundtrack , some sort of sci-fi thing to me but , yeah , it 's got all the elements that I love , the looseness and the kind of , you do n't know what 's going to happen .
It falls apart in the middle , comes back together .
`` Guitarist Nick McCabe added : `` We kind of knew that these sort of different segments would somehow fit together , one of which was a tune from 1993 I think , ` Muhammad Ali , ' and somehow they kind of have this like weird overlap between the three different things .
We kind of went back to Columbo the next day and we were calling one section , when we come to edit we kind of identify sections by ` It sounds a little bit like this , ' so there 's like the Divo Cam section , and like the Stonesy section and the Muhammad Ali bit that never actually found its way back into Columbo but generated quite a lot of ideas for it . ''
`` Muhammad Ali '' is included as a bonus recording on the LP version .
