On this track Casablancas maps out his emotions .
He sings of `` hopefulness turning into sadness turning into bitterness turning into anger , and then anger into vengeance . ''
The Guardian November 28 , 2009 asked him if the song reflected his feelings about The Strokes .
He replied : `` It 's about situations where you think nothing good will come , you feel stuck in a bad place , but I do n't want to say it 's about anyone in particular ... why , what would you like me to say ? ''
The interviewer pressed Casablancas if it was `` a seething rant about hating the Strokes ? ''
He responded : `` I have to go play music with them next week .
It 'd be like , ` Hey !
So you hate me ? '
But the whole point of that song is that those feelings are useless ; they just turn pain on to yourself . ''
