Several critics have commented that this song sounds like something written by Burt Bacharach .
However , Legend told Performing Songwriting magazine that any similarities were accidental .
`` I 'm not really a student of his work , '' he said .
`` He was a prolific songwriter , and there are songs of his that I did n't even know I knew , like songs sung by Luther Vandross and Aretha Franklin .
But I do n't own any of his albums .
It just so happened that I end up sounding like him . ''
`` You listen to music and use it to try to create something new , and who knows what 's going to come into your head , '' Legend continued .
`` A song is a song .
You produce a song , and at that moment when you produce it , that 's when you take it into a genre .
Before you produce it , it 's just a song , and it could be any style depending on how you decide to mix it and arrange it .
To me , when you evaluate songwriting , you do n't do it on a genre basis .
You ask , ` Is this a good song ? ' ''
