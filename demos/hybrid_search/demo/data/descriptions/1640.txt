The opening track from All Things Bright and Beautiful , the third album from synthpop act Owl City , finds Adam Young singing , `` Reality is a lovely place , but I would n't want to live there . ''
Young 's Christian faith is an influence on many of his songs , and in our interview with Adam , we asked him if he was asking for trouble with this line , as Christians are sometimes accused of not living in the real world .
Said Young , `` Trouble is n't my forte but I like to stay off the radar and do my own thing to keep myself happy .
That 's what I 've always done and the song is n't really meant to be taken literally .
It 's just a fun song with a quip in it .
I like the idea of staying in my own reality and coming out only when I need to . ''
Speaking with Christianity Today magazine , Young said , `` The line , ` Reality is a lovely place but I would n't want to live there ' is a fun way of saying I appreciate life exactly as it is , and although I ca n't change the world by any means , I can touch it .
It 's merely my way of dealing with things by proclaiming I ca n't keep the dark days from happening or the frustrations from occurring , but I can fix my eyes on that one blue patch of sky and thus keep my eyes focused on what truly matters . ''
