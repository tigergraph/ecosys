This poppy tune began as a Muppets collaboration .
An executive recruited My Morning Jacket to record music for a new version of the Muppets Electric Mayhem band in which MMJ would play behind a curtain while Muppet holograms performed onstage .
However after the executive got fired , the project disappeared .
Another Circuital track , `` Wonderful -LRB- The Way I Feel -RRB- , '' also originated from the ill-fated Muppet sessions.Frontman Jim James also got a call to write a couple of songs for the 2011 The Muppets movie , but they did n't use those either .
`` So now , twice , Muppet glory has been within my grasp , '' James told Rolling Stone .
`` It 's pretty heartbreaking , but it did propel us just to kick into high gear and finish our own record . ''
The song 's music video was directed by James Frost , who previously helmed the visuals for Radiohead 's `` House Of Cards '' and OK Go 's `` This Too Shall Pass . ''
It features plenty of spacey animation as My Morning Jacket are transformed into cartoon cyclops , whilst comedian Zach Galifianakis plays an animated wizard .
We suspect that some of the tongue-in-cheek lyrics - `` They told me not to smoke drugs , but I did n't listen .
Never thought I 'd get caught and wind up in prison . ''
- would n't have made it onto the Muppets project anyway .
