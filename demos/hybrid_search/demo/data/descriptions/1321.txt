This song finds Finn exploring his Catholic upbringing and the Christian concept of having Jesus as a friend .
He explained to Spinner : `` For one , Jesus is sort of a human from what we can know , from what we can identify with or put in our own world , someone who walks among us .
It was also kind of a jokey song , like remember in high school when your friend gets a new friend and he ca n't shut up about him ?
It was kind of like putting Jesus in that place . ''
