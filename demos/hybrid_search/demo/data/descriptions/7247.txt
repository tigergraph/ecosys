In the album 's publicity materials Wayne said that this autobiographical track was of special significance to him because of his extensive charity work with disadvantaged youth .
The Country singer came from a broken home and spent time on the streets and in foster care .
He explained : `` When you smell kerosene on a kid at school , you just know that they have a hard life .
Usually the kids who heat by a kerosene heater are poor kids .
They live in trailers or old houses and that 's their only way of staying warm is to either use a kerosene or a wood heater .
This song says ` Do n't let them get you down , keep your head up and stay proud . ' ''
