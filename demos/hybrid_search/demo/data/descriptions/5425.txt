PusherJones is a cartoon rock supergroup comprising Camp Freddy singer Frankie Perez , Velvet Revolver guitarist Dave Kushner , Weezer bass player Scott Shriner and Queens of the Stone Age drummer Joey Castillo .
This was the first song to be released by the group .
Kushner told Rolling Stone the story behind the song : '' -LSB- ` Count Me Out ' is -RSB- basically about a big , notorious rock band , '' he explained , `` and there 's a new guy that 's coming into the band .
You 're basically seeing all of the dysfunction and insanity , and the things that make for great rock bands through the eyes of the new guy .
A lot of it has been based on different stuff that has happened to me or stuff I 've heard being in Velvet Revolver for eight years . ''
The Simpsons ' creative director Dave Warren is also involved with the project , which Kushner told Rolling Stone was inspired by the original cartoon band , Gorillaz .
`` The original concept was for a Gorillaz-type thing , '' he explained .
`` Basically , me and Dave Warren became friends through Don Bernstein , who used to buy all the memorabilia for the Hard Rock .
Dave worked on The Simpsons , and then he and I started talking about stories and different ideas .
It eventually became an idea for a TV show , but then we thought , ` The music has to be as good as the animation . ' ''
The song is included on the soundtrack for the Disney movie , The Avengers .
