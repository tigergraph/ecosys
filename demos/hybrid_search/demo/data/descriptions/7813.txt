This was the last single Soundgarden released in the US or Europe .
In April , 1997 , the band announced they were breaking up .
Lead singer Chris Cornell released a solo album , then formed the band Audioslave with members of Rage Against The Machine .
In an interview with Chris Cornell back when the video was released , the interviewer asked him , `` If you could blow something up on the outside world , what would it be ? ''
Chris replied with : stupid people , mini malls , racists , and hardcore religious rights people .
-LRB- thanks , Elies - Surrey , Canada -RRB- Jerry Casale directed the video .
He was a founding member of Devo , a band that was making innovative videos years before MTV went on the air .
He directed all Devo 's videos , and has worked on videos for many other artists .
Jerry told us about working on this : `` I directed the epic video , the last video they made before they broke up .
Everybody had their own dressing rooms and only came out for the takes and then disappeared back in their dressing rooms .
They were very professional - when they would come on the set , they were ready to do what they were supposed to do , but it was all business .
I only found out during the shoot what was really going on with them , I had no idea they were about to break up until we were in the middle of this 3 day shoot of this epic 5 minute and 20 second song that was a very depressing song .
I guess it was Chris ' final statement about how he was feeling .
It certainly left you with a depressed energy after you heard it . ''
-LRB- thanks to Jerry for speaking with us about this song -RRB-
