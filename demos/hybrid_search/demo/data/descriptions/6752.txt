This midtempo power ballad was produced by the Runaways , whose credits also include Leona Lewis ' `` Take a Bow . ''
The Runaways are a production group , co-founded by Sam Watters , previously of the group Color Me Badd .
Other members include his songwriting partner Louis Biancaniello , Rico Love and Wayne Wilkins .
Hilson explained this song to MTV News : `` Women , we 're such hopeless romantics , and we want every man to be Mr. Right .
This song goes from good love to bad love .
You know , you kind of get drained of your energy after a while .
You 've become spent when it does n't work out with the person you 're in love with or you 're in a relationship with someone who does n't do the things you do for them . ''
This was the debut solo single for the R&B singer-songwriter Keri Hilson .
Previously she 'd written for a number of A List artists including Britney Spears `` Break The Ice '' and `` Gim me More . ''
Hilson had also been a featured artist on Timbaland 's `` The Way I Are '' and `` Scream . ''
The video features Hilson playing a boxer .
She explained to MTV News : `` Basically , I play a female boxer who 's in a relationship .
I spar with my boyfriend at times .
It starts really , really good , and as the video plays out , you see how much energy I put into this relationship or how little is reciprocated back to me . ''
