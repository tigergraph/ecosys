On Mother 's Day 2010 , Casting Crowns frontman Mark Hall and his wife Melanie adopted a little girl , Meeka Hope , from China .
The small child has some special needs and has needed a whole series of procedures .
The first year with her new family was a tough time for poor Meeka , but also for Melanie .
As Hall said , `` when a child hurts , no one else hurts like Mama .
`` This difficult period in the Hall family 's life inspired this song , which encourages the Christian to maintain a heavenly perspective when times are hard and to remember that God is faithful .
Mark Hall explained to NewReleaseTuesday : `` In the midst of a rough stretch , God gave me a gentle reminder that whatever we face ahead of us , he 's already there .
And he 's in control .
When I deal with high school seniors who are trying to figure out what their future looks like , I always tell them , ` God is already sitting at the end of your life looking back on it .
He 's not stressed , so let 's not stress on it now .
` We have a God who is not bound by time or space .
To him , space and time are mere creations .
A thousand years is as one day to God , so if you have anxious thoughts try to remember Philippians 4:6 -9 .
Paul encourages us to give our worries and fears to the Lord and pray with thanksgiving .
How do we pray thanksgiving when we 're anxious ?
I like to simply whisper , ` Thank you , Lord , that you are not anxious about this . '
It reminds me that God is standing at the end of my days and looking back on them .
Whatever comes , he 's already there .
Someday , an orphaned little Chinese princess will be able to testify to this wonderful truth .
In English . ''
