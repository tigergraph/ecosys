This three-part ten-minute opus shares its name with the piece of art designed by visual artist Emek that is on the cover of the album .
Emek , who also designed the artwork for New Amerykah Part One , explained on his website that he used song lyrics from the album as inspiration .
Badu told the Dallas-Fort Worth entertainment newspaper Quick about the track .
She explained : `` It 's a three-movement song .
The first movement is called ` Recovering Undercover Over-lover . '
It actually sums up the whole album , because I 'm talking about love and emotion -- ' I need you to do this , ' ' I want you to do this , ' ` You make me feel like this , ' ` Why do n't you feel like this ? '
It 's typical of how you feel in relationships .
The second movement is called ` Easier Said Than Done , ' and it 's about how hard it is to change after you 've been in a relationship for so long .
And then the third movement is called ` But Not This Time , ' because even though I 've done things a certain way for so long , I wo n't do that this time . ''
