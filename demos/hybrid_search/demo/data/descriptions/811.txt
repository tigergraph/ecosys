This sober ode to life and death is one of several tracks that deal with mortality on What We Saw From The Cheap Seats .
`` There 's a lot of mortality in the world , '' Spektor explained to UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph .
`` I 'm very Russian Jewish in that way .
Like , even when I was very young that was always in my head ... time , life , death .
I was very excited and smiley -- like I am now -- but you definitely have a lot of worries as a kid and you develop magical thinking to deal with it , to prevent the bad stuff from happening .
As life goes on you accept there 's a lot you ca n't control , that things just happen . ''
