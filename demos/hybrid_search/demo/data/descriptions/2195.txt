`` look in my eyesI 'm jaded now whatever that meansby sharing these things , I rip my heart out.it 's worth my time , whatever that means ... `` In the first couple of lines the singer is trying to convey to his love that all of the games she has been playing with him has jaded him , so much so that he immediately denies his feelings and words in the same thought with `` whatever that means '' as a way to save face in front of her .
In the next few lines he explains that by confronting her he is ripping out his heart , he is hurting his own pride in order to convey that she means the world to him , hence the `` its worth my time '' lyric .
But then again he withdrawals with another `` whatever that means , '' as he is in limbo with emotions and feelings , the conflict of his love for this girl and his fear of rejection , which is evident later in the song with the lines , `` Share with me 'cause I need it right now , Let me see your insides or write me off 'cause I 'd rather STOP now if you wo n't open up .
`` He 's asking her to share her true feelings or `` insides '' or to reject him so he can stop before he gets too invested and then is turned down , which would result in even more painful heartache .
