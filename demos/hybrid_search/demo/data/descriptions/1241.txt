This is the first single from Toronto band Metric 's fifth studio album , Synthetica .
According to Metric guitarist James Shaw , controversial glam rocker Gary Glitter inspired the tune .
`` I 've always wanted to do a song with the Gary Glitter beat , '' he said .
The song was released on May 1 , 2012 .
This song about a troubled youth was inspired by the spiraling student loan debt , which at the time it was written had reached $ 1 trillion in America .
Lead singer and keyboardist Emily Haines commented , `` You 're born free , but still that 250 grand in student debt really gets in the way of your ability to thrive . ''
