The third single from Country music artist Craig Campbell 's self-titled debut album finds the singer taunting debt collectors .
He co-penned the sing-along cut with Nashville songwriters Jason Matthews and Jim McCormick whose previous efforts together include Randy Travis 's track , `` You Did n't Have a Good Time . ''
The inspiration for this song came as a result of Campbell 's own debt .
He told Billboard magazine : `` I actually had a guy call me one day because I was late on a payment , and I told him when I get it , you 'll get it .
I thought ` That sounds like a pretty good song title , ' so we ended up writing it . ''
The video reflects the message of the cut .
`` It 's a song about being broke , yet it 's a positive uptempo , '' Campbell explained to The Boot .
`` So the video is me singing while these movers come in and take all my stuff out of the house . ''
