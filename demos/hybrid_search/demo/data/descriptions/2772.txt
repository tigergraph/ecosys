This ode to oral sex was produced by Rodney `` Darkchild '' Jerkins , who is responsible for producing several of Ciara 's past songs , including the 2007 single `` Ca n't Leave 'Em Alone . ''
`` I like Rodney for so many reasons , '' the singer told The Boombox .
`` He 's a friend of mine but musically , he 's one of the few music geniuses left that have had the history of the old school seasoning and the modernized way .
He has it all in one .
That 's what makes him very special . ''
`` Creatively , '' she continued , `` we just have a strong creative connection that it was only right -LSB- to work with him on Ciara -RSB- .
I think it makes the experience so much more fun .
We 're all about the challenge . ''
