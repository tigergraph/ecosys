This song finds Dolly singing about people who are worried about the end of the world .
She discussed the song with The Boot : '' ` In the Meantime ' talks about all these doomsday sayers telling you that the world is going to end today , tomorrow , next year or the 12th of May next year ... because somebody 's calendar has run out or somebody has some proof somewhere .
The song is about the fact that only God knows when the end is coming .
That 's what the scripture says : not anyone else but God .
People just run around so terrified about all the aliens and earthquakes and things going on that people actually forget to live in the moment .
What about now ?
What about just thinking about life and living ?
We are so consumed with fear that the joy of living is lost .
What are we going to do in the meantime ?
Think about loving one another .
Think about making changes .
Try to do a little better , try to make friends and try to be a little more forgiving .
Just make the most of now because when and if it does come , you 'll be a little more prepared .
You wo n't have to make so many excuses to God . ''
