Running to 5 minutes 48 seconds and credited to Bruce Foster , Tom Marolda and Sambora himself , this is unquestionably the inspirational song from Stranger In This Town .
It was the second single from the album , and is reminiscent of the Dan Fogelberg song `` There 's A Place In The World For A Gambler '' , including the choir .
Unbelievably , it failed to chart .
There is also a novel called One Light Burning ; written by R.C. Hutchinson -LRB- 1907-75 -RRB- , and published by Cassell of London in 1935 , it appears to share nothing more than its title with the Sambora song .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 2 -RRB-
