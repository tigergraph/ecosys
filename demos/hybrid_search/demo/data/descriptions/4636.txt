This bass driven tune is a track from American rock band Cage the Elephant 's second album , Thank You , Happy Birthday .
The song , along with much of the rest of the album , reflects lead singer Matt Shultz 's difficulties in growing up whilst in a rock 'n' roll band .
He told Spinner : `` After really trying to control everything in my life , it just unraveled before my eyes .
I had a huge hypocrisy in my own world .
A lot of the songs are written about that , discovering that . ''
`` I had this personal revelation , '' he added .
`` I 'd continue to see myself go back to the same thing that enslaved my life ; over and over , putting my hands in the fire , even after I realized what I was doing to myself and the people around me . ''
Aberdeen is a city in Grays Harbor County , Washington , which is most famous as being the hometown of Kurt Cobain .
The song 's title is a nod to the birthplace of the late Nirvana frontman .
This song did n't get written straight away and required three days of agonizing work .
When the band slowed down the chorus , the tune finally clicked and a lesson was learnt .
`` It was definitely realizing you do n't always have control of a situation , '' said Shultz .
`` If you want to make something you love it does n't always happen the first time around . ''
