This is the debut track from British indie rock band Cornershop 's seventh studio album , Cornershop & the Double ` O ' Groove Of .
The longplayer was released on the band 's own label , Ample Play .
Tjinder Singh commented on Cornershop & the Double ` O ' Groove Of , `` the full-length album was started on as early as 2005 , and rather than rushing it , I thought I needed to take the time to put it out properly .
It 's the type of album I 've wanted to have out since my youth and enthusiasm for raw Punjabi folk music - no auto-tune in sight . ''
The song features the vocals of Bubbley Kaur , whom Cornershop writer and producer Tjinder Singh first overheard singing whilst in his local launderette .
She originally guested on the band 's 2004 single `` Topknot , '' which got a remix treatment with a guest vocal by M.I.A.
