Australian singer-songwriter and musician Matt Corby began his music career at 16-years-old when he was runner-up on the reality TV talent show series , Australian Idol , to Natalie Gauci .
After relocating to London he was signed by Mumford & Sons ' Ben Lovett , the owner of the indie label Communion .
This was the lead single from his third Communion EP , Into The Flame .
The Into The Flame EP spent 34 weeks on the Australia Singles Top 50 .
It peaked at # 3 .
When asked by a Triple J radio station to describe the meaning behind this song , Corby replied : `` It came from a little sort of quarrel I had with a really close friend this year .
It 's a pretty dark time for me , I think I really just was n't being myself .
Me and one of my really good mates fell out , and it was because of something really stupid I did . ''
This won the publicly voted award for Song Of The Year at the 2012 ARIAs , Australia 's equivalent of the Grammies .
