Corbin wrote this song with Carson Chamberlain and Mark D. Sanders .
He said : `` It 's just a fun , upbeat song that 's cool and kind of quirky .
I love the line ` when you beg and plead to go fishing with me and I have to bait your hook , ' because that 's what happens when I take my wife fishing .
She likes to catch fish , but I have to put the bait on and take it off the hook . ''
This was one of three songs Easton co-wrote with Chamberlain and Sanders during a trip to Colorado .
`` When I came to Nashville I realized how important it was to write songs , '' he said .
`` The opportunity to sit in a room with experienced songwriters and learn their craft has helped me become a better writer . ''
