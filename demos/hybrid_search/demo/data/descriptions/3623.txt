This is the first song to be released from the Long Island rockers Taking Back Sunday 's self-titled fifth studio album .
The record marked the return of original members John Nolan -LRB- vocalist/guitarist -RRB- and Shaun Cooper -LRB- bass player -RRB- after the departure of Matt Rubano and Matthew Fazzi .
Both Nolan and Cooper originally left the band in 2003 citing irreconcilable differences , but patched things up and reunited with vocalist Adam Lazzara , guitarist Eddie Reyes , and drummer Mark O'Connell for Taking Back Sunday .
`` El Paso '' batters and pounds in a way TBS have never done before .
Lazzara told Spin magazine that in his mind it 's , `` probably the heaviest rock song we 've ever written .
Once we got done with it , we ended up listening to it 15 or 16 times in a row , and we were all kind of like , ` Holy s -- t .
When everybody 's like ` Holy s -- t ' about something , you 're onto something .
It 's a total motorcycle-raging-down-the-highway kind of song . ''
TBS spent a few weeks at the Sonic Ranch in El Paso , Texas while writing for the album .
Lazzara told Noisecreep that this song `` embodies both the mood of the environment we were in down there , and the mood we were in about being back together again and writing new music . ''
