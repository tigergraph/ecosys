Weller is assisted on this cryptic tale of forlorn love by Noel Gallagher on guitar .
He told NME of the ex Oasis axeman : `` we just cracked on with it and tried lots of things together .
In the end Noel played guitar on ` The Attic and bass on ` When Your Garden 's Overgrown . '
I brought him in because you just know you 're going to get something good out of him . ''
An attic is a space found directly below the pitched roof of a house .
The word is ultimately derived from the Attica region around Athens , Greece and it originally referred to a specific Athenian way of decorating a building and giving it symmetry and refinement .
When eighteenth century English architects revived the ancient classical mode of construction , they ornamented the top floor of a house with the Athenian - `` Attic '' - kind of pilasters .
Hence people came to refer to the top storey as the `` attic . ''
