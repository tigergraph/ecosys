This is about going to a shooting gallery - a place where people go to inject themselves with drugs .
In the first line they say `` My knife is sharp and chrome . ''
A chrome knife is another name for a syringe used for injecting drugs into your bloodstream .
`` Come see inside my bones '' is probably talking about injecting himself .
`` I can float here forever '' is describing getting high .
The other lines in the song all work with the same theme as well .
The album title is a reference to high grade cocaine .
