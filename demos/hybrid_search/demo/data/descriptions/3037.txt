It was Ronnie Wood , not Rod Stewart or Ronnie Lane , who sang the lead vocal for this song .
Lane and Stewart were at odds at the time .
Stewart did not think the song was up to his standards although both he and Lane recorded lead vocals for it .
Their producer suggested Wood give it a try , and that 's the version that was used for the album , which was Faces last studio album .
Lane left the group after Ooh La La was released and The Faces disbanded after their 1974 tour .
-LRB- thanks , Joel - Chicago , IL -RRB- Mitsubishi used this in commercials for their 2001 Galant .
Rod Stewart has recorded this for some of his Greatest Hits albums .
