This song is based on the early 1900s spiritual `` Dry Bones . ''
Randolph explained to Crosswalk that he and his band were intrigued by the chorus , so they looped it and started jamming to it .
`` We wondered how we could turn it into an actual song , '' said Randolph .
`` So we all just started talking , trying to figure out what dry bones meant .
Among other things , we decided that it 's an individual who gets worn out over time .
That 's why we came up with , ` Bones , dry bones , got ta keep jumpin ' around . ' ''
