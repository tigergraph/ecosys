Chief songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told Q magazine May 2009 that he 's `` not sure about that song yet . ''
21st Century Breakdown is split into three acts -LRB- Heroes And Cons , Charlatans And Saints and Horseshoes And Handgrenades -RRB- .
Armstrong explained to The Sun April 24 , 2009 : `` I liked the three acts as I work in three parts .
I have dual personalities , but I 'm on medication so that 's okay .
Heroes And Cons represents dealing with these two demons and what they mean .
Then Charlatans And Saints deals with religion .
The final act gets its name because horseshoes are a sign of luck and hand-grenades are a sign of an explosion .
The characters are just something I sing through .
You give them a name and it gives them a life . ''
