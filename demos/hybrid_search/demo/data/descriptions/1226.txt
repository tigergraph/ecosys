He sings on the album 's closing track : .
`` These are the last words I have to say That 's why this took so long to write There will be other words some other day But that 's the story of my life '' Co-producer Danny Kortchmar explained in Mojo magazine : `` He was intimating that he might be running out of ideas and becoming less happy with writing Pop songs .
That 's why the last song on the album is called ` Famous Last Words . ' ''
