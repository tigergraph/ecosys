Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme sings on both this tune and another AM track , `` One For The Road . ''
Homme produced half of Arctic Monkeys ' 2009 album Humbug , and vocalist Alex Turner lent backing vocals to QOTSA 's ... Like Clockwork track `` If I Had A Tail . ''
Turner told BBC Radio 1 's Zane Lowe that Homme 's appearance on the album was both casual and potentially unusual .
`` The Josh thing was very much a case of one of us returning a back scratch to the other , '' he said .
`` He came down and sort of got us out of a little rut .
It 's just fun , it 's friends , extended family now - -LSB- they -RSB- came round , had a fun night .
His contribution to our record is really exciting , it 's probably my favorite .
The 30 seconds that he 's in there is just , I dunno , it 's like something that I 've never heard before . ''
Turner told NME about Homme 's contribution to this song : `` I think he sounds a bit like Bowie .
It 's my favourite bit of the record , that breakdown ; that 30 seconds where it all goes weird , '' he said .
`` What 's most interesting about it is how accidental it was - I 'd sung on the new Queens record a few weeks previous , and we were kind of in a rut a little bit , in this dark rooms .
So Josh came down , Nick -LRB- O'Malley , bass -RRB- made cocktails and we just hung out for the night .
We got him to sing on ` One For The Road ' and then we were playing him ` Knee Socks , ' because we 'd just been working on it .
We were thinking about putting someone on that section , possibly to do the bit that the three of us were originally doing , which is this really fast R&B bit .
But then he heard it and then he said , ` I 've got this really great idea for a counter-melody background thing , ' and he went and did that and it suddenly became this whole other thing that you never excited it to be .
I think it kind of makes the tune .
Suddenly , we were out of the rut and re-energised - Josh saved the day ! ''
