This Rodney `` Darkchild '' Jerkins produced track was inspired by a diary that Furtado kept as smitten sixteen-year-old on a summer vacation in her parents birthplace of Sao Miguel , Portugal .
This was one of seven collaborations with Jerkins on The Spirit Indestructible .
`` We wrote most of these records in the middle of the day , '' Furtado told Aol Music .
`` Rodney 's vibe in the studio is totally different .
He just sits there and creates these beats completely on his own , but he 's got this crazy , crazy , crazy positive vibration , and he and I , we meet at this very childlike place .
I feel like we 're two kids throwing sand around in a sandbox .
I feel completely liberated making music with Rodney , and he 's very open .
He lets me go crazy , and I let him go crazy , and we try out different ideas , and it 's magical . ''
