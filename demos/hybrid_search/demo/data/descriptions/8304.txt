This is the first single from English alternative pop singer-songwriter Richard Hawley 's sixth album , Truelove 's Gutter .
There is very little instrumentation on this track .
Hawley explained to The Sun `` It 's totally minimalist .
If I added loads of strings or guitars , it would lose its impact and any depth .
The bleakness is what makes it .
My grandfather told me years ago that when he used to play the music halls and people were talking , the worst thing you can do is to try and drown them out by playing louder .
They just shout then .
He used to play quieter and they would be exposed and shut up .
It works .
I 've tried it at gigs and now I 'm trying it on record . ''
Hawley told The Sun September 18 , 2009 that the message behind this song is do n't be selfish , instead `` make an effort for the one you love . ''
He explained : `` If you 're in a long-term relationship , there 's always the danger you take each other for granted .
Do n't let the calendar push your buttons but give flowers at odd times and randomly too .
I have found it makes my Mrs happy over the last 20 years . ''
Truelove 's Gutter is a location in Hawley 's native Sheffield , which was named after 18th century local innkeeper Thomas Truelove who had a gutter that used to dump rubbish in the River Don .
Hawley explained the album title to The Sun : `` I was with my mate -LRB- local author and historian -RRB- J.P.Bean .
He had some old documents with ancient Sheffield street names and I saw Truelove 's Gutter in the list .
I was n't looking for an album title but it fitted the music so well I had to use it . ''
