John Lennon claimed this song came to him based on the tune `` I 'm Wishing '' that his mother used to sing him from the Disney movie Snow White .
In the beginning of the Disney song , Snow White is singing to the doves , `` Wan na know a secret ?
Promise not to tell ?
We are standing by a wishing well . ''
This was the first Lennon/McCartney song to be a hit for another artist - it was recorded by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas .
Their version was # 1 in England for 2 weeks .
Lennon said in interviews 1971 and 1980 that he wrote this song in time for his wedding in August 1962 .
Most Beatles tracks were credited to Lennon/McCartney , and while the band was together , they rarely discussed who actually wrote what songs , so it was n't until after their break-up that Lennon revealed he was the composer of this song .
-LRB- thanks to Johan Cavalli , who is a music historian in Stockholm -RRB- George Harrison sang lead .
It 's one of the few Beatles songs not sung by the person who wrote it .
The Beatles were very close to a record deal , and John wanted to marry .
Their manager Brian Epstein was very upset as he had been pitching the boys as 4 good-looking single chaps from England .
John could not be talked out of the wedding so Brian made him a deal .
As the 2 could not afford a honeymoon , and did not have a place of their own , he would let them use his flat for 2 weeks , with the promise that they not tell anyone they were married .
In the flat on their honeymoon , for obvious reasons , John wrote `` Listen , do you want to know a secret ? ''
John has said that the secret in question was n't necessarily that he was married , but that he finally realized he was actually in love .
-LRB- thanks , Ken - Hartland , MI -RRB- George Harrison said in Musician magazine that the musical inspiration for the song came from `` I Really Love You '' by the group The Stereos .
