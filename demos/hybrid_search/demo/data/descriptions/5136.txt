The first single from Fall Out Boy vocalist Patrick Stump 's debut solo album , Soul Punk , finds him singing about his pride in his home city of Chicago .
It was debuted on AOL Music on June 28 , 2011 .
This song caused Stump to change the course of the entire Soul Punk album .
He explained to Billboard magazine : `` I had written a while draft of the album and then at the 11th hour came up with ` This City . '
I really loved the song but felt like , conceptually , it did n't fit on the album .
I had to go back and make an album for that song because I loved it so much . ''
The song finds Stump teaming up with his fellow Chicagoan Lupe Fiasco .
The singer told AOL Music their relationship goes back before the release of the rapper 's debut album Food & Liquor in 2006 .
Said Stump : `` Before Soul Punk came out he and I were talking about working on something together .
I ended up producing the song ` Little Weapon , ' for his The Cool record , '' he said .
`` I actually wrote the hook for ` This City ' with him in mind before I decided to use it for Soul Punk , so when the label asked me if I 'd be interested in doing a remix with an MC he was the only real way I 'd say yes . ''
The Ken Koller directed video features Stump singing whilst various images and lights are projected on the walls .
Stump told to MTV News why instead of filling the screen of shots of city life he went with an artfully abstract way to present the song .
He explained : `` The song 's called ` This City , ' and it describes a lot of these images in a city , and I feel like those images are already there ; it would be kind of redundant to take a camera into a city ; it 's almost like the colors and the lights and the images that are going to be around this are going to be representing the life in a city .
`` He added : `` One thing that Ken and I were talking about is that a city is so complicated , so we wanted to do something a bit different with it , and a bit more abstract . ''
