This song came out of a backstage session between the Lady A trio and Josh Kear during the band 's Own The Night World Tour .
`` Josh came out to see us on the road because that 's where we did so much of the writing for this album , '' said Charles Kelley .
`` There 's just something about this song that I think people can relate to .
It 's that time after a breakup when everything about a place reminds you of that person , so all you want to do is just get the hell out of there .
We really wanted the production to reflect that almost haunting feeling . ''
Charles Kelley admitted that when the quartet first wrote this , it was n't one of their favorite songs .
But thanks to a little production work , it emerged as one of his favorite tracks on Golden .
`` We had written it a while back , but it kind of got put on the back burner a little bit , '' said Kelley .
`` We were n't sure how it would come out , and the minute Paul Worley said , ` Let 's just approach it a completely different way , ' it just showed itself as one of the frontrunners of this record . ''
Lady A utilized for Golden a crew of studio musicians .
Band member Dave Haywood told Radio.com they , `` just -LSB- tried -RSB- to play it like a band -- to play it live and get a good performance . ''
By way of example , he described a section of this song .
`` There 's a whole outro that was never part of the original intention , '' he said .
`` Those are the moments that are fun when you 're in the studio .
To approach it more organically and strip it down to just the band and us , lets the song shine through and lets the vocals shine through even more . ''
Lady A debuted the song during a performance for Tim McGraw 's Superstar Summer Nights on April 8 , 2013 .
