This track from Ben Harper 's tenth studio album , Give Till It 's Gone , finds the alternative rock singer-songwriter questioning , `` how long have I been looking down ? ''
before concluding that every day is precious .
The song was co-written by Ringo Starr who also plays drums on the track .
The song was largely written on the spot .
Harper explained to The Huffington Post : `` With ` Spilling Faith , ' we had worked out the song structure - the song was between three and four minutes - and Jesse , the bass player in the band , sat down at the piano .
Ringo loved what he was playing , sat down on the drums , we all went to our instruments , worked it up , and the next thing you know , it 's swirling around the room .
We worked out the structure and format , pressed ` record ' and went .
We get to the end of the song , we look up , and Ringo is still playing .
We 're all thinking , ` Okay , that 's where it was supposed to end . '
You can kind of hear the song kind of dip as we 're all looking around , ready to bring it down , and Ringo looks up and just waves the stick like , ` Come on , boys ! '
Then , we just ventured off into this uncharted territory .
We 'd check in every couple of minutes , and he had his head down , crushing it , so we would go back to putting our heads down and just feeling our way through it .
Let me put it this way ... if he was still playing right this second , we 'd still be there playing the world 's longest song .
Finally , we look up and see him give us the ` wrap it up ' signal , and we landed , and that is one take . ''
