This is a track from Green Naugahyde , the seventh studio album by alternative rock group Primus .
It is the first Primus album to feature the trio of bassist/vocalist Les Claypool , guitarist Larry LaLonde and drummer Jay Lane who originally left Primus in 1988 before their Frizzle Fry debut set .
Sonically the song features a strong riff .
MusicRadar asked bassist/vocalist Les Claypool if he works out the riffs at home while noodling around .
He replied : `` It varies .
I 'm a big believer in spontaneity .
In the case of Hennepin Crawler , we were just sitting in the studio and I started going -LSB- imitates a bass -RSB- ` Bam-da-dum-dum-dum ! '
Jaysky heard it and jumped in right away .
Then Ler joined in and I hit the record button .
There it was . ''
