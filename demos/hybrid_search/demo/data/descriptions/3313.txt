This tender blue-eyed soul tune was a happy accident that came about from an in-studio collaboration with U2 and Bob Dylan producer Daniel Lanois .
`` We wrote that song with Daniel , and it was interesting because we 'd never written anything with anyone before , '' explained drummer Ronnie Vannucci , Jr in publicity materials .
`` Some producers work in a capacity where they become like a fifth member ; they 'll pick up a guitar and get in the room with you .
We did it entirely live , and only spent about an hour on it - we did a couple of takes , and that was it .
It was a really fun song to do . ''
Daniel Lanois had the Killers in the studio until 3am getting the track perfect .
`` We 'd never written with anyone like Daniel , '' frontman Brandon Flowers recalled to The Sun .
`` It was a lot of fun making that track .
Five dudes in a room with the microphones on and a tape rolling .
That song really captured a moment . ''
