Written by group members Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman , Stewart explained the song 's origins in a BBC Radio Wales interview : `` This song I wrote with Graham Gouldman and originally it was a very bluesy song , and we actually played that to Kev and Lol , Godley and Creme , and Kevin said , ` It 's interesting but I think you should speed it up a bit and make it a bit more beefy . '
And then they left the band .
So we never got it in the studio to try it with them , but , Graham Gouldman and I did .
And it 's biographical , a lot of songs are biographical , you know , I remember walking through the rain and the snow when I lived in Manchester and we did n't have a telephone .
I had to go and find a phone box to ring the girl who was about to become my wife , and the , the phones were down , and it was snowing , and these , these vivid pictures are there .
If you put them in a song , a lot of people identify with a similar situation . ''
