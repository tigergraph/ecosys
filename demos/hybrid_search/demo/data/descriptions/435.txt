Bass player Matt Taylor told Alternative Press about the song : `` We wrote this one in November 2008 during our first writing session for the album .
After a couple minutes of jamming - I hate that word - Tony and I started playing the bass and drum part that you hear right at the top .
I 'm a sucker for when drummers play the rims of their drums with kick and snare .
I think that 's Fugazi 's fault .
Anyway , all the parts of the song came together very quickly after those first few minutes .
Once Justin added his vocals , the song ended up sounding frantic , desperate , confused and angry .
It 's my current favorite on the record . ''
