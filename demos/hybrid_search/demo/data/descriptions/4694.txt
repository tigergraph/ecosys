This song from Tales Of Us finds Alison Goldfrapp singing about a Hollywood actress , Laurel Grey , and a misogynist serial killer .
The album was inspired largely by Alison Goldfrapp 's love of noir fiction and this track was inspired by Dorothy B. Hughes ' 1947 crime novel , In A Lonely Place .
In A Lonely Place was filmed in 1950 in bowdlerised form with Humphrey Bogart .
`` Do you know what , '' Alison Goldfrapp told The Independent , `` I ca n't stand the film , and I do n't really like film noir .
I think the books they 're based on are way more exciting and evil and gritty and explicit .
I got really into Patricia Highsmith , too .
There 's just this sense in them that something 's about to happen , or maybe it has just happened , there 's a psychological fear running through them .
Brooding , but quite romantic as well .
And those books are very visual , there 's a simplicity there .
You can hear the fog and the sea , and you can smell the dampness in the air , and you can feel yourself going round a corner in one of those great big Fifties cars , going slowly down a dark street , by the rolling sea , and a feeling of doom , and you 're just immersed in it . ''
`` I really wanted it to have that feeling in ` Laurel , ' '' she continued , `` with the harpsichord in there and the reverb , and the feeling of being sleepy and losing consciousness , which is how that world seems to feel .
David Lynch 's Lost Highway is like that too , where he just has a camera hovering , looking at a room that 's empty , and you do n't quite know why you 're looking at it , and s -- t , what 's going to happen ?
I like the idea that the dread does n't really arrive .
And that 's a nice feeling in music as well .
Sometimes you do n't want things to be resolved , or explained . ''
