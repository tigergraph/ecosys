Initially , Derek E. Miller , the guitarist and producer of Brooklyn Noise Pop duo Sleigh Bells , was uncertain whether they were going to be a guitar band or should concentrate on more sample-heavy stuff .
He told Spin magazine that for their sophomore set , Reign Of Terror , `` I had to pick sides .
The beats are still important to me , but the guitar won . ''
One of the biggest influences on Reign Of Terror was Def Leppard 's 1987 seminal hard rock set , Hysteria , particularly on this stadium-metal ballad .
Miller told Spin : `` There 's a song on our album called ` You Lost Me ' where I 'm straight-up ripping pages out of their playbook . ''
