The music video features British musician Ed Sheeran throwing shoes at the Rizzle Kicks pair .
This samples The Clash 's `` Revolution Rock , '' a track from the punk rockers 1979 album , London Calling .
The song is about the loss of ambition as you get older .
Jordan `` Rizzle '' suffers from attention deficit hyperactive disorder and he admitted to The Sun : `` When I was younger I had a real thirst for knowledge and I was really bright .
I found it hard to concentrate when I was a kid .
I used to do all kind of s -- t. I entered writing competitions , art competitions , I joined the young historians group .
I did n't give a f -- k .
Then you get older and your horizons get narrower .
The upbeat production masks the fact that it 's quite a depressing song . ''
