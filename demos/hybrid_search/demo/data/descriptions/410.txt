Vocalist Jehnny Beth described this driving , dissonant tune to NME as a `` frustration song . ''
She compared its meaning to Grinderman 's 2007 track `` No Pussy Blues , '' where Nick Cave expresses his exasperation at the constant rejection from a woman he was trying to seduce .
Beth added , that this song is about `` the frustration of seeing people who have potential , but are unable to express it . ''
The song is a new recording of the tune that was originally included on the I Am Here live EP , which was released on Jehnny Beth 's record label Pop Noire .
