Georgia Clay is Josh Kelley 's first foray into Country music , which is probably the best genre to write a tribute to whiskey .
He wrote the song with Rob Hatch and Paul Jenkins , and says the title comes from his favorite forecast : `` It 's Raining Whiskey . ''
When we spoke with Kelley in 2011 , he explained : `` I wrote it the same time that I wrote ` Naleigh Moon . '
And I was just sitting with my buddies and I was like , ` Hey , man , should we pour a little whiskey and do some writing ? '
-LRB- laughing -RRB- And we just kind of started talking about that and the next thing you know we were talking about the idea of how you portray a party that you want your friend to come to , but they refuse to leave the house .
Well , you go to the party and you 're like , ` Dude , it 's off the chains , man .
It 's so crazy here , it may as well be raining whiskey . '
And so we thought that would be a great way to get Johnny to finally come out of the house kind of thing .
So that 's what that song is about .
Just a party song . ''
