This is a traditional song that Folk singer Leadbelly popularized before his death in 1949 .
He recorded a lot of songs that otherwise might have been lost , including `` Goodnight Irene '' and `` Midnight Special . ''
Leadbelly 's version is a cappella and commonly sung by laborers to pass the time while working .
This was produced by Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz , who were architects of the Bubblegum Sound , producing groups like The Ohio Express and the 1910 Fruitgum Company .
A remixed version of this song is used in the 2002 movie Kung Pow : Enter The Fist when the main character fights the villain .
-LRB- thanks , Frankie - Sarch , IN -RRB- Ram Jam were a short-lived band from New York City , and this was their only hit .
While the lyrical content is pretty standard Folk/Blues material - about a black woman from Alabama who has a `` wild '' child , Ram Jam took some heat because some civil rights groups felt the lyrics were disrespectful to black women .
While the lyrics can be deconstructed , Ram Jam 's version is driven by the powerful beat and aggressive tempo , making it one of those songs that gets your heart beating faster .
The song is commonly played at sporting events to pump up the crowd .
The Australian band Spiderbait recorded this in 2004 .
It was their first single to reach # 1 on the Australian charts .
