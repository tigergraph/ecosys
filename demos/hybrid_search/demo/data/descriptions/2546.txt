Lead singer Jason Wade : `` There are several different stylistic elements you 'll probably see develop in Lifehouse over the next few years .
There 's that grunge-type stuff , but there 's also a Led Zeppelin/Pink Floyd sound that comes out of the bridge of `` Spin , '' for instance .
-LSB- Drummer -RSB- Rick -LSB- Woolstenhulme -RSB- played a Jim Keltner kind of vibe on this one , and we overdubbed some stuff .
It was a very creative process , especially because it involved all of us .
It shows another direction we can continue to explore next time .
I thought it was a good way to close the album . ''
