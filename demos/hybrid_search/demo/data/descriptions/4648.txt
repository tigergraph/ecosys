On this haunting Country-Soul number , Adkins shows his vulnerable side when he sings about not being able to outrun that past love .
He told CMT News about the background to this song : `` I made a statement one time at the very beginning of my career , and I said that when I sing a song about heartache , I 'm not singing about somebody giving back my senior ring .
I 'm talking about it from the most devastating , serious point of view .
I 've been through just a horrendous divorce -LSB- from his first wife -RSB- , and I can say this without fear of upsetting my -LSB- current -RSB- wife .
She knows I love her , and everything 's cool .
But when my first wife and I got divorced , I was devastated .
I mean , I was heartbroken .
I mean totally , and I did n't ever think I 'd get past it , really .
I mean , there were days when I did n't think I was simply going to live through that heartache .
It manifested itself into physical pain .
I could feel it .
It hurt that bad , and I just could n't get away from it .
So when I recorded this song , I just went back there in my head and what that felt like .
That 's where this song comes from . ''
The song was covered by husband and wife duo Thompson Square on their 2013 album , Just Feels Good .
Adkins sung this song in the style of a Sinatra-type crooner .
He explained on the album 's promotional materials : `` I 'm not afraid to do stuff like that , and we 've done stuff like that live , we 've just never recorded that starkly .
I told -LRB- producer -RRB- Frank -LRB- Rogers -RRB- that on this one I wanted the vocal to do the work , and carry the entire load , that 's the way I want to cut this and put my voice out there and let the chips fall where they may . ''
