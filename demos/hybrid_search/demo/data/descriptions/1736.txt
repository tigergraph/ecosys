The Chicago Alternative Metal trio close their sixth album with this piece of old school Chevelle .
Singer and guitarist Pete Loeffler admitted to Artist Direct that he had concerns about including the song on Hats Off To The Bull before his brother , drummer Sam Loeffler convinced him .
`` I was terrified to put that on the album because when we 'd rehearse it , we 'd say the same thing .
It feels like it should 've been on the first record , Point # 1 , '' he said .
`` Have we moved beyond and do we want that sound ?
Sam was all about it , and I 'm glad that he was .
Back then , I did n't really feel it as much as he did .
When somebody in the band has such strong feelings , you want to get on board because half the time you 're all struggling with decisions .
The arrangement on that song went every which way , and it turned out that the simplest arrangement was the best for it . ''
The song touches on the criticism that Chevelle have received from some quarters that they are just clones of acts such as progressive-metal band Tool .
Pete Loeffler explained to Artist Direct : `` It 's about getting s -- t from peers and people saying that you 're ripping somebody else off .
As you 're coming up in the world of music , you 're going to get a lot of s -- t. People are trying to figure out what you are and what you 're doing , and they want to label you .
I 'm thumbing my nose at that conversation .
A lot of people will still say that we sound like Tool .
It happens every time we put an album out .
I 'm certainly not going for that ; I 'm trying to be honest with what I like to play .
` Clones ' touches on that a lot . ''
