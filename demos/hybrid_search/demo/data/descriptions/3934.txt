This is the title track to HIM 's eighth studio album .
In our interview with group 's lead singer/songwriter Ville Valo , he explained : `` It 's my tribute to the music I grew up listening to .
It mentions church bells tolling and thunder roaring , and that 's a dedication to the first Black Sabbath album and so forth .
There are two or three different stories going on at the same time .
In one , it describes music verbally , and my favorite songs .
And on another level it 's a bit more of an emotional journey and relationship-related little ditty . ''
You might detect and '80s sound to this one , which can be attributed to Ville Valo 's love of music from that decade - he cites Depeche Mode and Nick Cave as two of his favorites from the era .
Valo came up with the basic track for this song when he was working on some Electronic side projects that never came to fruition .
When it came time to work on the Tears On Tape album , he brought out what he had of the song and gave it the HIM treatment .
`` I had that melody and I was playing around with that for about eight months , '' he told us .
`` Then since we started working on new stuff with HIM , I thought , ` Let 's try it out .
It 's a bit different than the rest of the songs . ' ''
