This instrumental features current Foo Fighters frontman and former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl and ex Guns N ' Roses and current Velvet Revolver bass guitarist Duff McKagan .
Slash explained to Musicradar.com : `` I wrote the basic parts and I had sort of a loose arrangement , but this was definitely the loosest song of the bunch , and having Dave there , who is such a dynamic drummer -- I 'd never actually worked with him but I 'm very familiar with his drumming -- and with Duff there too , they 're both very creative so I knew we could throw this together .
I did n't want it to be epic , I wanted it to be three minutes long , and it came together very quickly with a very spontaneous , live kind of vibe .
Actually , I tried to get Dave to sing it , but he would n't sing it , so I just said f -- k it , we 'll put guitars on it .
He was adamant about not singing , he was like , I just wan na play drums , and he 's a f -- ing phenomenal drummer . ''
Speaking to Ultimate-Guitar .
com , McKagan recalled the recording of this song : `` We all played in the same room , Slash , Dave and I .
We went down to the studio .
I had n't heard the song and neither had Dave , so I went down there , and listened to the song .
Slash had a guitar , and he played it so we could watch .
None of us read music , so you got ta just watch the guy play .
We went in the room , and we hashed around the song for about forty-five minutes maybe .
We then just started recording , and I think we were in and out of there in a matter of two , maybe three hours .
It was recorded pretty quick ; we caught that energetic first or second take , and we nailed it pretty good.It was great playing with Dave .
I 've never played with him before ; we 're friends , but I had just never played bass with him also playing drums .
It was a great experience , really fun .
The three of us playing together was really fun , a lot of laughs . ''
