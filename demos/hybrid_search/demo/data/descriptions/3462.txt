This is the title track from American metal band Fear Factory 's eighth studio album .
It was their first record to feature the line-up of original Fear Factory members , guitarist Dino Cazares and vocalist Burton C. Bell alongside bassist Byron Stroud -LRB- who played on the last two Fear Factory albums and drummer Gene Hoglan -LRB- Death , Strapping Young Lad -RRB- .
Bell explained in publicity materials : `` The title track describes our world as the soulless program that it is .
Every part serves a purpose .
There is no such concept as individuality within the machine .
We have carved our place inside the machine .
We have grown banal within our apathy .
We have become mechanized . ''
