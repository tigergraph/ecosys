Moby -LRB- from his record label web site -RRB- : `` The song ` Alice ' started with a mistake .
There 's this effect that I have , a very old proto-distortion pedal , and I was playing a bassline through it and there was something broken on the distortion pedal and it made this weird but fantastic feedback .
So this song starts with this weird bass feedback , which is just a really happy mistake because it was n't originally supposed to sound like that .
After writing the track I then sent it out to Aynzli and the 419 Crew , who contributed their amazing vocals .
Aynzli 's style is so fast and so dense and fluid , I think that he 's going to have a remarkable career .
And what makes the 419 Crew so special is that they go back and forth between Yoruban and English -LRB- as they 're from Nigeria -RRB- . ''
This , like the rest of the album , was recorded in Moby 's home studio in New York .
It was produced by Dan Grech-Maguerat , who has worked with Radiohead and Scissor Sisters .
Moby -LRB- from Uncut magazine February 2008 -RRB- : `` There 's a song called ` Alice , ' which has a lot of different vocalists .
There 's Aynzli , a Jamaican MC who now lives in the UK , a Nigerian hip hop group called The 410 Crew and my friend Amelia a burlesque performer . ''
Moby told The Sun newspaper May 8 , 2008 about the contribution of UK rapper Aynzli Jones on this track .
`` I 've never met Aynzli but I first heard him on MySpace .
His approach to rapping was so talented and unique he reminds me of Rakim .
Aynzli is a cross between him and Eminem .
I sent him the track and he sent me back vocals .
The track is okay , but Aynzli makes it . ''
