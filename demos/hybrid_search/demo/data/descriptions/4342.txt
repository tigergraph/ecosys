This song about a soldier killing an enemy in battle , only to have him ask the soldier to deliver his last message to a loved one , starts with a concert bass drum , marching soldiers and crashing cymbals , then finishes with an ethereal gospel choir .
Bassist Joey Westwood explained in promotional materials : `` We felt like we could do anything we wanted to .
We did n't want to limit ourselves .
We really got to explore different sounds on each song .
It shows a broader range of what we 're capable of .
All those small things taken together really helped open it up stylistically .
This record is very visual , almost like a Broadway play . ''
