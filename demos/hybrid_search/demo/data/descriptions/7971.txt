Gaz Coombes told Uncut magazine March 2008 why this was chosen as the first single from the album : `` Whenever I 'm in the car with my daughter , Raya May , and play this , she always yells and screams ` bite me ! '
She knows it 's me and loves it .
After she did it for the first time , I rang up the record company and made sure it was the first single , because clearly , she knew it was the one .
Too much subtlety passes children by ! ''
