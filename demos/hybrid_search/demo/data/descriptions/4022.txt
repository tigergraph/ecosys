This is the opening track of Biffy Clyro 's sixth album , Opposites .
Frontman Simon Neil told NME : `` It 's a song of two halves and a nicely bipolar way to start a Biffy record . ''
Opposites was recorded at Santa Monica 's The Village studio , the same place where Glasvegas conceived their second album , Euphoric Heartbreak .
Neil said to NME regarding the song 's organ sound : `` We recorded the church organ in Pasadena in the largest Baptist church in California .
It was more powerful than any amplifier I 've ever sat in front of . ''
