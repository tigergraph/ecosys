`` Girls in Their Summer Clothes '' can be interpreted as either a bittersweet lament about getting older or an upbeat nostalgic remembrance of the narrator 's younger days as he gazes at the beautiful girls in their summer clothes walking by .
Springsteen 's manager Jon Landeau described this song as having a `` little bit of a Pet Sounds-type feeling mixed in with the sound of the E Street Band . ''
This was Springsteen 's first song to chart in the Hot 100 for nearly three years .
The Boss 's previous chart entry had been `` Devils & Dust , '' which peaked at # 72 in April 2005 .
In an interview with the Sunday Times -LRB- 30th September 2007 -RRB- , Springsteen was asked about the lyric , `` Things been a little tight , but I know they 're gon na turn my way '' : `` I think people listening to that know who that guy is .
I was interested in having a song where you get this classic image of a late summer , light on , in a small American town , and it 's perfect in a way that only occurs in pop songs - when the air is just right , where the sun 's sitting a certain way .
And I subvert that at the end of the record with ` Long Walk Home . ' ''
This won the Best Rock Song trophy at the 2009 Grammy Awards .
However Springsteen revealed to MTV News that he was n't aware he was in the running for it .
He chuckled : `` I did n't even know I was up for a Grammy !
I opened the newspaper on Monday and saw that I had won , and thought , ` Well , that 's great ! ' ''
Springsteen won the same award the previous year for `` Radio Nowhere . ''
