Five Finger Death Punch habitually choose provocative album titles and the Heavy Metaller 's third set American Capitalist succeeded in prompting some raised eyebrows and scratching of heads .
Guitarist Jason Hook explained the thinking behind it to Loudwire : `` We are five extremely driven and motivated individuals and I think capitalism , for me at least , says that we 're always trying to capitalize on whatever our situation is at the time .
We like opportunity , we like turn opportunity into bigger and better .
A winner takes all mentality of capitalizing on the situation , whatever that is for you .
For me , it 's a positive thing , we 're fighters , and we want everything .
You work hard for your money so we work hard for your money . ''
Want to know where Five Finger Death Punch got their name from ?
Apparently guitarist Zoltan Bathory came up with their moniker after watching a scene in a Quentin Tarantino movie .
Vocalist Ivan Moody explained to Dabelly magazine : `` Zoltan was watching Kill Bill 2 , you know he 's from Hungary , right ?
His sense of humor is a little bit different , so to him I guess it was the funniest thing in the world , this five finger lotus punch or whatever it was .
And I guess it started out as a joke thing , he said , ` This would be a great band name ' and yada , yada , yada .
When they came to me they were actually thinking about changing it and I told them , ` Dude , that is the most killer heavy metal band name ever .
That 's like Slayer , that 's Metallica , Five Finger Death Punch , it sits well with me . '
I pushed it around in my own head to make it work a little bit more metaphorically , but yeah , it came from Kill Bill 2 ''
