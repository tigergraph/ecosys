Multi-instrumentalist Tommy Sparks hails from Sweden .
His first musical love was hip hop , thanks to a mixtape of Kool Moe Dee and Jungle Brothers that his sister lent him .
In his teens , Sparks moved onto grunge , before discovering dance music through The Prodigy .
After moving to London he formed the highly regarded Vatican DC who broke up after releasing a critically lauded debut album .
Sparks ' manager , Chris Gentry , secured a solo record deal with Island Records for him on the basis of this song .
Having toured with The Prodigy in his Vatican DC days , Sparks co-wrote a track with his dance heroes , `` Wild West , '' which featured on the bonus disc for Invaders Must Die .
A few months later , this song was released as Sparks ' second single , and it became his first UK chart hit .
