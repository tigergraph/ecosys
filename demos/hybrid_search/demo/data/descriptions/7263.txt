This was one of several songs on Yeezus that super-producer Rick Rubin -LRB- Johnny Cash , Run-DMC , Red Hot Chili Peppers -RRB- worked on .
West had come to the bearded beat guru three weeks before the album 's last possible delivery date to the label asking him to help complete the job .
`` When he first played it for me , it was a more middle of the road R&B song , done in an adult contemporary style , '' Rubin recalled to The Wall Street Journal .
Kanye had the idea of combining that track with a cool sample he had found and liked -- I removed all of the R&B elements leaving only a single note baseline in the hook which we processed to have a punk edge in Suicide tradition . ''
American Electronic Protopunk musical duo Suicide have been intermittently active since 1970 .
A flyer the band circulated in November 1970 was the first ever to use the phrase `` punk music '' to advertise a concert .
Never widely popular amongst the general public , Suicide 's New Wave and Synthpop sounds of the late '70s and early '80s are regarded as highly influential by music critics .
This soul-powered tune finds West opening up to a significant other .
It features smooth R&B singer-songwriter-producer and former lead singer of The Gap Band , Charlie Wilson crooning on the hook .
Other West tunes that Wilson has contributed to include `` See Me Now , '' `` All of the Lights '' and several tracks from the rapper 's ` G.O.O.D. Friday ' series .
The video was directed by the fashion photographer Nick Knight and finds West and his fiancee Kim Kardashian driving through the Arizona desert on a motorcycle .
During an interview with Charlamagne tha God on Power 105.1 â€² s The Breakfast Club , West admitted the clip was tongue-in-cheek : `` I wanted it to look as phony as possible , '' he said.Actors James Franco and Seth Rogen filmed a shot-for-shot parody video of the promo during downtime on the pair 's movie , The Interview .
The deadpan version of the visual found Franco playing West and Rogen taking on the role of Kardashian .
Kim Kardashian revealed that she and West found the clip to be very funny .
Speaking with Interview magazine , West said people who criticized the look of the music clip are afraid of dreams .
`` That video is one of the closest things to the way that dreams look and feel , or the way joy looks and feels , with the colors , '' he said .
`` There are rules to how a lot of things are : the concrete jungle , stone pavement , brick walls ... But this video completely did n't respect any of those rules whatsoever .
It 's a dream , and I think the controversy comes from the fact that I do n't think most people are comfortable with their own dreams , so it 's hard for them to be comfortable with other people 's dreams . ''
Speaking to the New York Times , West described himself as a `` minimalist in a rapper 's body . ''
He added that he brought in Rubin to `` bring all those vibes '' to the album .
`` I 'm still just a kid learning about minimalism , and he 's a master of it , '' West explained .
The song is built around a sample of `` Bound , '' a 1971 Soul tune by Ponderosa Twins Plus One .
Other tracks borrowed from are `` Aeroplane , '' written by Norman Whiteside and performed by him under the pseudonym of Wee and the `` uh huh , honey '' from the intro to Brenda Lee 's 1960 hit tune `` Sweet Nothin 's .
`` So what did Brenda Lee think about West borrowing from her hit tune ?
She responded to CMT after hearing this profanity-rich song : `` It 's kind of like a rapping thing with a '60s vibe a little bit -- that was probably one of the cleaner parts .
`` That song is over 50 years old , '' she added , `` so who would have thought that they 'd even know that song , or probably even me ?
I 'm proud that he liked the song and thought enough of it to incorporate it . ''
Ricky Spicer , a group member of Ponderosa Twins Plus One who recorded the lyrics for `` Bound '' in 1969 when he was 12 , told the New York Daily News that he never gave West permission to use the song .
He added that he only learned of `` Bound 2 's '' existence while listening to the radio .
As a consequence , Spicer filed a suit on December 23 , 2013 in Manhattan Supreme Court .
demanding that West compensate him or cease and desist from using his voice .
