This song is particularly special to Steel Panther guitarist Satchel , not only because it details an experience many guys have had in a relationship , but also because of the way it was written .
He explained to AntiMusic : `` We had just finished doing a string of shows in the UK and we got on the tour bus .
The plan was to go to the airport , which was a 4 or 5 - hour drive , and fly home .
Well , after a couple of hours and banging some groupies , the other guys all passed out .
Me ?
Well .
I have a hard time sleeping on those damn tour busses .
So I 'm laying there in one of those tiny little bunks , staring at the ceiling that 's 4 inches from my face , thinking about how hard it is to be on the road in a bitchin ' band like Steel Panther , cuz everyone wants a piece of our magic ... and I realized that 's probably why none of us have steady girlfriends.Most girls would never be able to handle it .
Too many chicks .
Too many drugs .
Too many chicks giving us drugs .
And that 's when the chorus came to me .
And once it started , I could n't stop it .
I wrote pretty much the whole song in that bunk on that tour bus on the way to the airport .
All the chords and everything .
Anyone who 's ever been with a jealous girl can relate to this .
F -- k - Anyone who 's been with any girl can relate to this .
It 's a good thing I ca n't sleep on tour busses . ''
