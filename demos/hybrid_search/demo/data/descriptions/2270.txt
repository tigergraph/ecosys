Frontman Charlie Fink told The Sun newspaper August 8 , 2008 why he made this the title track : `` The title song was perfect for the album name as it best explains what I 'm trying to say .
It 's the centerpiece of the album and condenses my philosophies on life into five-and-a-half minutes . ''
Fink added that the album explores the themes of love , death , time and friendship , `` without drawing any conclusions on any of those subjects . ''
