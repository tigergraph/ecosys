Shane Filan of Westlife said in publicity materials that this Steven Lee Olsen , Bryn Christopher and Carl Falk penned love ballad was a song that their mentor Simon Cowell was keen for the foursome to record .
He explained : `` This song has again a very typical Westlife sound .
It 's a song that Simon really wanted us to record and now seeing it on the album we can see why he wanted it so much .
It 's got great vocals on it , it 's a Swedish ballad from Westlife .
You know , it 's the typical kind of thing you 've heard over the years .
And we never wanted to alienate exactly the fans that do like that kind of stuff .
Even though that this album is slightly different direction there are still three or four really Westlife songs on there . ''
