This stuttering song finds Katy imploring a lover to give in to the music and `` for once go wild . ''
The Philadelphia producer Diplo produced the cut whilst Australian rapper Iggy Azalea also lent a hand .
The American singer-songwriter Norah Jones recorded a song with the same title for her 2009 The Fall album on which she declares , `` All for the better .
Worst for the way .
We 're light as a feather .
Got you and I together . ''
Speaking with Digital Spy , Iggy Azalea said the `` collaboration was crazy . ''
She added : `` I was like , ` What is this all about ?! ' , but I love it , even if I do n't understand what the song is about .
She was really sweet and sent me a bottle of Dom PÃ©rignon .
I do n't drink , but now when people come over they 'll think I 'm rich ! ''
