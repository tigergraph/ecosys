Mark E Smith , the frontman of the Manchester rock band The Fall , features on the breakdown of this song .
The Guardian February 27 , 2010 commented to bassist Murdoc that apart from , `` Where 's north from here ? ''
they could n't understand a word he was singing .
The Gorillaz bass player replied : `` Oh , he lets out a whole bunch of stuff .
` It waaaass the GLITTER FREEZE ! '
` Listen-ah !
You would n't credit or believe this-ah ' .
But you 're not meant to be able to understand it ; just meant to feel the force of this pirate ship sailing into the middle of the album . ''
Murdoc said on Gorillaz 's website : `` I 'm really glad we managed to get Mark E. Smith on the record .
I 'm not sure he felt the same , but y' know .
He wanted to do his part facing north .
` Which way 's north from here ? '
We used his question as a little intro , kind of like what we did with Shaun Ryder on ` DARE ' .
Sometimes the greatest moments are those little mistakes that you catch in the mix when you 're just warming up . ''
The animated bassist added : `` Like ` Punk ' on the first album , and ` White Light ' on Demon Days , this is the album 's rawkus section of chaos .
Every album 's got to have one . ''
