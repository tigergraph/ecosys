Third Day fan Chris Daughtry lent his voice to this rock anthem .
Bassist Tai Anderson told Christian Music Today how Third Day hooked up with the American Idol finalist : `` We all met Daughtry last year at the Grammy Awards and he talked about listening to Third Day when he first got started in music .
Mac and Chris have since remained close friends , so he was a natural to have on the record , especially since the song he sang -LSB- ` Slow Down ' -RSB- speaks to friends trying to be there for each other .
Our schedules did n't allow us to be there when Chris recorded , but we did get it captured on video ! ''
