This song finds Kelly at her most cynical as she sings to a Bad Boy , `` I am too smart to let you in here , but I 'm just dumb enough to linger . ''
The singer penned the track with songwriter/producer Chris DeStefano -LRB- Scotty McCreery , David Archuleta -RRB- .
Kelly told AOL Music that this and other tracks on Stronger reflect how she is in her personal life and because she dates a lot of wrong guys , she can pull from her experiences .
The American Idol champ explained : `` I grew up with a single mom for a little bit of my life , in the growing stages .
Just watching her work so hard , I 'm not a feminist , but it kind of lit something inside of me like , ` Always take care of myself , ' and ' I can do anything I want to do if I really work hard for it . '
Watching my mom really instilled those thoughts in my head .
It can be really damaging in a relationship because it 's hard for me to let go of control of certain things .
I could be a great girlfriend if a guy was really independent like me , but I 'm a bad a girlfriend if the guy is leachy and has no identity .
That 's why I do a lot of kiss-off songs . ''
