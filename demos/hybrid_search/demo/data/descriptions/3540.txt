Rihanna sings about `` Strip clubs and dollar bills '' on this feminine spin of the cash-and-strippers lyrical content that is so popular with male rappers .
The song was produced by Hip-Hop beatmaster Mike WiLL Made It and it could be classed as an urban sequel to the producer 's hit with Juicy J , `` Bandz a Make Her Dance . ''
`` Urban music was pop for the '90s when Bad Boy had their crazy reign and then you had the Beyonc√© and the Usher records , '' Mike WiLL told Billboard magazine .
`` Real dope music is coming back .
I feel like that 's part of my job .
Being 23 , being young and coming in the game , and Rihanna being 24-we wanted to make a song that would be a game-changer .
After they hear ` Pour It Up , ' girls wo n't be scared to flex , wo n't be scared to talk about their money . ''
Rihanna recruited four southern rappers - Young Jeezy , Rick Ross , Juicy J and T.I. - to spit rhymes for the song 's remix .
She largely takes a back seat on the Hip-Hop reworking of the strip-club anthem .
The pole dancing themed music video was filmed in May 2013 and co-directed by Rihanna .
Among the exotic dancers featured in the clip are Nicole `` The Pole '' Williams , Candace Cane , and Secret Moneii .
The uncensored version of the video lasted just 10 minutes on Vevo before the streaming service set it to private view only .
After being asked to submit some tracks for Rihanna , Mike Will sent three demos .
`` I did multiple records for her .
I did the stadium - -LSB- sounding -RSB- record and , of course , I had to do a record like ` Pour It Up , ' because it was that turn-up , '' he told MTV News.Rihanna picked out this tune , which was the closest one to the producer 's signature sound .
`` I know that 's what they were really looking for from me .
That 's why they really called me in there , to give them a record like that , '' he said .
`` It kinda has like a ` Bandz a Make Her Dance ' feel to it , but it still has Rihanna 's own hop . ''
Young Jeezy cites Kendrick Lamar 's `` Swimming Pools -LRB- Drank -RRB- '' in his verse , presumably in response to being mentioned in the Compton rapper 's `` The Art of Peer Pressure . ''
