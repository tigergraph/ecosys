Donavan wrote this song by way of an apology for his friend and folk music notable Bert Jansch .
He explained in an interview with Mojo magazine June 2011 : `` Bert Jansch was going out with Beverley -LRB- Kutner , nee Martyn -RRB- at the time , and for a brief while I was part of the triangle , although not in the way Bert thought I was .
I wrote the song because I felt bad , as I loved Bert .
It also captured everything I was concerned with at the time : jazz , classical , medieval troubadour and folk .
-LRB- Arranger -RRB- John Cameron realized instantly that acoustic instruments would give the album its sound . ''
Bert Jansch 's best known recording is `` Needle of Death , '' which was hugely influential on the musical and drug habits of many British youth .
