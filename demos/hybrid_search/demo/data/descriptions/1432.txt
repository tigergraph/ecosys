The only cover on Clear As Day hearkens back to Keith Urban 's days as lead singer of the country trio , Ranch .
Co-written with Vernon Rust , it featured on their self-titled 1997 debut album and peaked at # 50 on the country singles chart .
Scotty revealed to The Boot that when Keith Urban sent the song to his Universal Music Group Nashville label , he attached a message to him saying , `` I think this is a great song for you , Scotty .
I think you 'd be great doing this .
Hope you enjoy it . ''
Scotty explained why Urban pitched the song for his debut album : `` He thought it would be really cool for me to cut it , and when I heard it , it was a lock .
It has a cool message and feel .
It 's just a cool song .
I can picture myself rocking out to in the car driving somewhere . ''
