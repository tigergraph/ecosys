Lead singer Andrew Schwab told jesusfreakhideout.com : `` Growing up in a tiny town , you are told that any dream larger than the size of the town itself is not worth dreaming .
This is a song for anyone who has been told they can not accomplish their hearts ... this is a song defying naysayers , a kiss to a vision fulfilled . ''
