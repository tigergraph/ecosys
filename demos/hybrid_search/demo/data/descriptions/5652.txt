This song from a girl 's perspective is a duet with cult American film-maker Harmony Korine 's wife Rachel .
The six short instrumental passages on the album called `` Harmony '' were named after the filmmaker in gratitude for rescuing the album , after he asked Spiritualized main man Jason Pierce to help score the soundtrack for his film Mr Lonely .
Pierce told Drowned in Sound that he originally wrote this with Country star Emmylou Harris in mind , but after falling ill with a bout of double pneumonia he did n't have the courage to ask her .
He went on to explain : `` So for a long period of time it felt like it would n't end up on the album , it felt strange with me singing it , and then it worked out because Harmony Korine 's wife sang it as the very last piece that went into the album and it really made sense , it was really beautiful .
