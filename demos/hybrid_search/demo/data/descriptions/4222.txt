Ryan has also written and produced for Jennifer Lopez , Lil ' Jon , Natasha Bedingfield , Hilary Duff and Leona Lewis among others .
For the latter he co-wrote and producer her UK chart topper `` Bleeding Love . ''
In the same interview the American Idol runner-up was asked how much beat-boxing there would be on the album , to which Blake Lewis replied : `` It 'll have a hip-hop overtone .
Beat-boxing will be throughout the whole album , as kind of a journey .
When you start the album and you finish it , it 'll be like an electronic or hip-hop mixtape .
I call it my Michael Jackson Bad album , in the sense that every track on that album is Pop music but every single track is totally different than the next .
He has his `` Dirty Diana '' and then he has his `` Smooth Criminal , '' you know .
The album 's organic , but very mechanic at the same time - that 's where the Audio Day Dream comes in . ''
Blake Lewis told Entertainment Weekly about his album : `` The album is going to be called ADD -LRB- Audio Day Dream -RRB- .
I like to call it the two-thousand - '80s , because all my musical influences have come from the '80s , like new wave , Michael Jackson , Prince , Sting , U2 , New Order - all this great electro-pop .
I 'm heavily influenced by electronic music because I 've been listening to it from about '93 to now . ''
