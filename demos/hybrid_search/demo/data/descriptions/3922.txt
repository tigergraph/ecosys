Leave Your Sleep is an album of original music with lyrics adapted from various 19th and 20th century British and American poems about childhood .
This song is adapted from a nonsense poem by 19th-century stockbroker Charles E Carryl , which briefly earned him a reputation as America 's answer to Lewis Carroll .
Like many of the poets whose work is included on the album , Carryl experienced much tragedy - disease and family deaths .
Merchant told The Sunday Times : `` I felt a strange kinship for my co-writers , even though they were n't around and , by my standards , had often lived lives of unimaginable suffering . ''
