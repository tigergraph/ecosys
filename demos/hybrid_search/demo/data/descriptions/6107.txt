When Nada Surf lead singer/guitarist Matthew Caws was young , his parents , both university professors , were based in New York City .
This slow-building song from the band 's seventh studio album The Stars Are Indifferent To Astronomy is about his childhood in the Big Apple .
The song 's music video was filmed and directed by Phil Harder in New York City .
Caws told Spinner : `` Because ` When I Was Young ' is about my childhood I thought a video about a kid growing up in New York would be great .
The only suggestions that went out to Phil were a kid growing up in New York and The Royal Tenenbaums .
But he really got it right and more , suggesting and nailing things about childhood that I would not have been able to express . ''
