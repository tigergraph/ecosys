Kellie penned this song with Brent Cobb and Barry Dean .
It was inspired by the singer 's very first date with her songwriter husband , Kyle Jacobs .
`` Our first date was at Cracker Barrel , and they have all of the rocking chairs lined up out front that you can purchase or just sit there and wait for your name to be called to go in and eat , '' she explained to The Boot .
`` We sat out there in those rocking chairs for Lord knows how long , and played twenty questions and got to know each other .
We talked and talked , and fell in love with one another in those chairs outside of Cracker Barrel .
`` Then for my birthday , he went to Cracker Barrel and bought two rocking chairs and carved our names in them , '' she continued .
`` They 're on our front porch , and that 's where we like to go sit and try to solve all of the world 's problems !
So , ` Rockaway ' is about those chairs . ''
