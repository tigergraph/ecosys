Frontman Kele Okerke has spoken of how he listened to Nirvana a lot whilst writing and recording Four .
The rawness of the Seattle grunge trio 's debut album is reflected in Bloc Party leaving incidental noises in several of the tracks , such as the band talking on this rocking album opener .
`` Nirvana 's Bleach was kind of influential in me starting to think about making a record , '' Okerke told The Sun .
`` I 'm not really a big Nirvana fan at all but I found myself putting on Bleach every other day and it started to seep into what I wanted our album to sound like .
I do n't think sonically it influenced us but it was about the approach . ''
According to Q magazine , frontman Kele Okereke 's lyrics for this track were inspired by wasted days watching US reality TV .
