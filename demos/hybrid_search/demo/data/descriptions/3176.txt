The Eumenides is a Greek tragedy in which Orestes goes before an Athens court to decide whether his murder of his mother makes him worthy of the torment the Eumenides -LSB- the three Furies of ancient Greece -RSB- have inflicted upon him .
In 1944 the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon painted Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion , a triptych based on The Eumenides .
Esben & The Witch 's Daniel Copeman explained to Spin magazine that it was Bacon 's three-sectioned painting that inspired the song : `` I first saw the Eumenides in a Bacon triptych , so we had the idea of a song in three different movements .
We 're invariably trying to write music to tie to an idea or an image . ''
The American Rock supergroup A Perfect Circle 's song `` Orestes '' is another take on this Greek myth .
