`` Picture '' is a confusingly-billed song .
Originally , Sheryl Crow was supposed to do the song with Kid Rock .
That got shot down due to contract disputes between Atlantic and A&M Records .
So Rock re-did the duet with Allison Moorer .
Now it charted on Billboard 's Hot 100 as `` Kid Rock featuring Allison Moorer or Sheryl Crow , '' because some radio stations played the official single and some used the Crow version from the album , not caring beans about piffling record company contracts .
The writing credits are Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow , if that helps .
That 's also Crow in the video .
Yes , this song does sound a lot like The Golden Girls Theme .
So much so , that visitors to our message boards asked if it was a remake .
My , look who 's come a long way since Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast !
Could anyone have listened to Kid Rock -LRB- real name Robert James `` Bob '' Ritchie -RRB- in the '90s and told you that his best days were ahead of him when his highest charting song would be a slow , soulful , country tear-jerker ?
It was certainly out of character , but not unprecedented : Kid Rock 's former DJ Uncle Kracker had a big Easy Listening hit two years earlier with `` Follow Me . ''
Since the success of `` Picture , '' Kid Rock has had numerous duet partners from the country music world , including Kellie Pickler , Martina McBride , and Miranda Lambert .
This was also Sheryl Crow 's second-most successful single after `` All I Wan na Do . ''
