This is a track from the British ambient duo Zero 7 's fourth album , Yeah Ghost .
Zero 7 comprise Sam Hardaker and Henry Binns , who have been friends since childhood .
Binns provided a rare lead vocal on this track .
He also sung on `` Your Place '' from The Garden .
This song marked a turning point as the Zero 7 duo struggled to come up with a new record after their mutual parting of ways with long-time collaborator Sia .
The inspiration was The Zidane Turn , the signature move of the French soccer player Zinedine Zidane , whose popular nickname was `` Zizou . ''
Hardaker explained in publicity materials : `` I was sitting in the studio thinking about how we were gon na make this record happen .
We definitely needed to turn things round at that point .
The song is about overcoming self doubt I suppose , and I just liked the image of Zidane changing a situation in a second in such a graceful way . ''
