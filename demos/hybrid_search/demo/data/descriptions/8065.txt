Nancy Wilson : `` I wrote this song about girlfriends I 've had , but it 's been true for me too .
I thought back on the times when I was younger and got involved with a guy who strung me along and then left me on the hook .
Life is just too short , but that 's a perspective you can only get from living it . ''
Ann Wilson : `` This was an exciting song to sing because it 's got such a great range and packs such an emotional punch .
When the words are this direct and straightforward you can put everything you 've got into them . ''
