This is the opening track to Wonders Of The Younger , the sixth album by American indie rock band Plain White T 's .
The song acts as a sort of thematic overture for the record .
`` Lyrically , '' said front man Tom Higgenson , `` I think it says exactly what I want the album to say .
I think the line that sums up the whole album is Let your mind go anywhere it wants to .
Do n't lose your imagination .
Do n't get so wrapped up in your day-to-day life that you forget to dream or be creative , or forget to recapture those things or at least remember them .
That 's the beauty of life .
I 'm a very nostalgic guy , so a lot of where my head lives is in memories .
I spend a lot of my time looking back and smiling at past things that have happened in my life . ''
Higgenson explained in a track by track interview with Alternative Press magazine how he penned this song : `` The writing process for the album was exciting because I knew exactly the theme and feeling I wanted it to have before writing a single note .
I knew I wanted to take chances and step out of my comfort zone as often as possible .
` Irrational Anthem ' was written as a few different pieces that I knew fit together somehow .
I just had to put the puzzle together .
The lyrics perfectly embody and foreshadow what the entire album is all about .
As soon as I finished writing it , I knew it would be the first track on the album . ''
