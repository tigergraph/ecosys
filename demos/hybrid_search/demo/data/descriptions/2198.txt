This song finds Nicks and producer Dave Stewart singing , `` What 's more important than freedom ?
/ Being needed . ''
She explained the inspiration for the song to Spinner UK : `` We went to Village Recorders -LSB- in L.A. -RSB- to do our basic drum and bass tracks , and Reese Witherspoon came down .
Dave was going to be taking a week in Nashville to do some recording , and she said , ` Well , I have a condo there , and if you want to stay there , you can . '
I said , ` That would be cheap , Dave . '
And Reese said , ` What 's cheaper than free ? '
And Dave Stewart and Stevie Nicks looked at each other and went , ` Oh my God !
What a great country song this could be . '
`` Nicks continued : `` I thought it was going to be a tongue-in-cheek goofy song , and it ended up to be anything but .
We were both very surprised .
I believe in my heart that that song will live on forever .
I said to everybody , ` We have to really treat this song with kid gloves , because this may be the best song that Dave Stewart and Stevie Nicks ever does . ' ''
