Lambert explained this acoustic country swing number , which was inspired by a 1980 Merle Haggard song : `` I 've been obsessed with Airstreams for a while now .
I do n't really know why .
Do n't have one , do n't need one .
But I want one !
I always do ` The Way I Am ' by Merle in my show , if I have an encore , just because I love that song , and it 's not right not to play a Merle song on stage .
I was telling Blake -LRB- Shelton -RRB- one day , ` There 's a song missing that I have n't written yet . '
He said , ` Why do n't you go write `` The Way I Am '' for you ? '
And I did .
That song is definitely , what if I was n't doing this ?
What if I could just fly away out of my body for a day ? ''
