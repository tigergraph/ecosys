This song about being an underachiever prompted a lawsuit from the publishers of The Stranglers .
It was claimed that Elastica took the song 's riff from The English band 's 1977 hit `` No More Heroes . ''
The case was eventually settled out of court .
Drummer Justin Welch recalled to NME May 11 , 2013 : `` I had this bassline that was on another planet to everything else .
We were really into the Stranglers then , so that keyboard line was lifted from then and popped into our own song . ''
