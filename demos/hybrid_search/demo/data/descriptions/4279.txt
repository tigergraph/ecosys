Guitarist/keyboardist Rostam Batmanglij started writing this track whilst Vampire Weekend were still working on their previous Contra album .
He then sent it to the band 's vocalist Ezra Koenig in the summer of 2009 .
Batmangli told NME : `` It started with really hectic drums , like Aphex Twin , but we got rid of them , and it 's inspired by the Dollar Brand record ` Good News From Africa . ' ''
Vampire Weekend premiered the song along with '' Everlasting Arms '' on April 30 , 2013 during a live gig in New York .
