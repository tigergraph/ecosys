London-born , Caribbean-raised singer-songwriter Marlon Roudette is the son of music producer Cameron McVey -LRB- Massive Attack , All Saints , Sugababes -RRB- and the stepson of singer Neneh Cherry .
He lived in London with his mother , designer Vonnie Roudette , until the age of nine when he moved to St Vincent .
Roudette returned to London when he was 17 and as one-half of Mattafix , along with his friend Preetesh Hirji , he enjoyed some success .
You might recall their single `` Big City Life , '' which was an international hit topping the charts in Austria , Germany , Italy , New Zealand , Poland and Switzerland .
However the band lost their record deal and they were forced to break up meaning Roudette had to go solo .
Roudette wrote the song with Guy Chambers , the hugely successful songwriter and producer best known for being Robbie Williams ' songwriting partner for several years .
He told The Sun : `` I 'd met Guy years ago when he came to see Mattafix play in Berlin .
He was a fan and had contacted me via MySpace .
We kept in touch and , when I had nothing , he believed in me .
We got together to write ` New Age ' when I did n't have a record deal and everything was IOUs .
But he believed in me .
He was the one who said I should go solo .
He understands me .
He sat me down and told me I was a solo artist and had the voice to go for it . ''
Having broken up his band , Roudette then split up with his fianc√©e leaving him at rock bottom .
This song is about the first day that the distressed singer saw the sun above the grey clouds .
He told The Sun : `` New Age is about the first day I thought I was going to get through it and survive .
It 's a positive record about moving on .
I 'm really wearing my heart on my sleeve and I think people have got that . ''
`` New Age '' was a big hit in Europe , spending eight weeks at # 1 in Germany and also topping the charts in Austria and Switzerland .
