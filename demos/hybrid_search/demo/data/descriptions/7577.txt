The Orb is a British ambient house group , founded by British musician Dr Alex Paterson and KLF member Jimmy Cauty .
After Cauty left in 1990 , Paterson assumed lead role .
The group achieved six Top 20 hits in the UK in the mid 1990s and helped popularize the Chill Out music genre .
This was originally released in 1990 as a single on the Big Life independent record label .
After several re-releases the song finally peaked at # 10 in the UK in 1993 .
The sample of Ricky Lee Jones ' voice attracted the artist 's displeasure and Big Life settled out of court with her for an undisclosed sum .
This ambient pop song was a collaboration with Killing Joke 's Martin `` Youth '' Glover , who later teamed up with Paul McCartney on the former Beatle 's Fireman project , -LRB- check out `` Do n't Stop Running '' -RRB- .
Lyrically , the song is centered around clips of an interview by Levar Burton , best known as Kunta Kinte in Roots , where musician Ricky Lee Jones talks dreamily of the fluffy clouds in the Texan skies of her childhood .
Their conversation was taken from the PBS-TV children 's program Reading Rainbow .
Jones later said in interviews that the odd nasal tonality of her voice was the result of a heavy cold .
Also incorporated is a guitar figure from American minimalist composer Steve Reich 's `` Electric Counterpoint , '' as recorded by Pat Metheny , and a harmonica sample from Ennio Morricone 's `` The Man With The Harmonica '' from the soundtrack of the 1968 spaghetti Western Once Upon a Time in the West .
