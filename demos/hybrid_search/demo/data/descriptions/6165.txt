Howler is a garage rock band from Minneapolis , Minnesota comprising lead guitarist and vocalist Jordan Gatesmith , drummer Brent Mayes , guitarist Ian Nygaard , keyboardist Max Petrek and bassist France Camp .
Gatesmith 's previous musical history includes such ridiculously titled groups as Total Babe , A-Cups and Gay Animals .
On the strength of an EP and their live show , the quintet were signed by Rough Trade Records .
In the summer of 2011 , Howler recorded their debut album America Give Up , which was released on January 16 , 2012 in the UK and the following day in the US .
This song is a thinly veiled attack on the Minneapolis scene that , according to Gatesmith , `` on the whole , hates our guts . ''
`` I felt like I was never really wanted there , '' he explained to NME .
`` A lot of people are genuinely enthused and are like , ` Holy s -- t this is amazing , this is the first time this has happened since 1986 for this city . '
But , on the other hand , Minneapolis is full of music has-beens and people that almost made it .
They 're all in their 30s starting bands with each other .
There we were , these 19-year-old kids that ended up getting signed to Rough Trade .
No wonder people hated us . ''
