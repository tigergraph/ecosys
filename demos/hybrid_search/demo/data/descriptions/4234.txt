This is a track from Country music singer Josh Thompson 's debut album Way Out Here .
Thompson co-wrote the tune with Nashville songwriter Rhett Akins , whose credits include `` All About Tonight '' , `` The Shape I 'm In '' and `` Farmer 's Daughter '' -RRB- .
Akins told the story of the song in an interview with The Boot : `` This was the first time Josh and I had written together .
It was his idea .
We were spitting some titles out , and he said , `` I have this idea called ` Blame It on Waylon . ' ''
I liked the title , I just thought it would be kind of too predictable if we wrote the whole thing about Waylon Jennings and use lines from his songs.Obviously we had to have kind of a Waylon sound or a Waylon beat through the song .
Josh came up with that cool guitar lick , and we saved the Waylon part until the chorus .
We started thinking of things that we blamed things on , then when we got to the chorus , we came up with the part about loving music and that 's why I sing - because of Waylon , Willie Nelson and all the outlaws.I think I came up with the part about having the new tattoo : ' I blame this new tattoo on a 100-proof bottle of whiskey . '
We just started listing things that we blamed , things that have happened in our lives .
Then we got to the part about ` but for my honky-tonk ways , I blame it on Waylon .
` It was a fun write .
I really had no idea he was going to even cut it .
He never mentioned the song again after that day we wrote it .
Next thing I know , I run into his producer , and he said they were cutting it . ''
