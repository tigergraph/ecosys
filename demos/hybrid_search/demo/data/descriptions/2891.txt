This is the lead single and title track of Country artist Dierks Bentley 's fifth Capitol Nashville studio album .
The record is steeped in the bluegrass and roots music that moved him to become a country musician in the first place .
Bentley penned the song together with Angelo Petraglia and it features background vocals by Alison Krauss .
This song was inspired by time that Bentley spent on a plot of land he owns in rural Tennessee .
He explained : `` I fell in love with this kind of music the first time I walked into the Station Inn with a fake I.D. at 19 years old .
These guys , who were my age , were playing their instruments so hard it knocked your head back .
After that , I never missed a Tuesday night there in almost eight years .
Without the whole bluegrass community taking me in , I would have had no place to start from .
It is my foundation . ''
