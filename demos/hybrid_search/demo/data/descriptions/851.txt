This is the title track of British electronica duo Goldfrapp 's fifth studio album .
Critics have noted that the lyrics are the group 's most optimistic and immediate to date .
Singer Alison Goldfrapp explained to The Sun March 12 that the album title reflects this new positive outlook : `` We thought Head First summed up the sentiment of the album .
The idea of being gung-ho about things , going into situations in life with an abandonment and a confidence .
Doing something without thinking and without fear is exactly where we are .
It 's this new outlook that brings us right here today . ''
