Gloriana 's Mike Gossin penned this steamy number along with the band 's producer Matt Serletic and the Nashville songwriter Hillary Lindsey , who has contributed to many of Carrie Underwood 's hit tunes .
Gossin told Billboard magazine how the song was inspired by observing a couple of lovers , who were unconscious as to what was going on around them : `` I was driving a golf cart one day after a festival , '' he explained , `` and it proceeded to break down about a mile away from the venue .
I did n't have my cell phone , so I just decided to hang with some fans at a nearby RV park and wait for somebody to find me .
There was this one couple in a car making out , totally oblivious to everything around them .
The song was written about that young and rare moment when you were having the perfect night , with the perfect girl , in the perfect place and do not care about the where , what and when of it all - and the world stopping around you . ''
Gossin told The Boot how the song came about .
`` I had this guitar riff that I had written for the first record , '' he explained , `` but I wrote it late .
We had finished up the record already , so the producer who I showed was like , ` Save it for the next record . '
I brought it back to the table and we wrote this song about being stuck in a moment with a significant other , and you 're oblivious to everything else that is going on around you . ''
