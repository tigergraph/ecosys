Ziggy Marley is the oldest son of Reggae legend Bob Marley and the father of six children .
On this song he sings about how he 's taken a different route from his father and family .
He explained to Spinner UK : `` It just means I do things on an independent level , kinda like what my father 's idea was .
But in my personal family life - if you had an eye into my family , you 'd see that I kind of stepped out of the family environment and went out on my own , into a new environment .
So things like that .
And I mean each of us think differently .
I think one way and another family member might think another way .
My father think one way , my mother think another way , and I think how I think .
I take another road and I probably take roads that other people would n't take or try things that other people would n't try , do things other people would n't do .
I see things how other people would n't see it . ''
