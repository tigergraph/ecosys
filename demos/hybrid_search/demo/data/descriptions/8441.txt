This was released as the third US single from British pop/R & B singer Natasha Bedingfield 's third studio album Strip Me .
A radio edit , featuring a newly recorded vocal from Jamie Foxx , was created for the US release .
Bedingfield explained the story behind the song in an interview with Artist Direct : `` This is the basic premise of ` Weightless . '
As humans , we 're all on a quest to not get bogged down and let things get to us .
There 's a lot of heavy stuff going on in the world , so this song is about freedom and finding peace .
I 've had my own share of brokenness and burdens .
For me , writing this song is a challenge for myself to become more weightless and less burdened by the little things that do n't matter . ''
