Justin Timberlake ends his The 20/20 Experience album on an ambient note .
He explained in an interview with MySpace that such songs as this tune and `` Strawberry Bubblegum '' were his attempts to put his own spin on Radiohead 's electronic rock .
`` I want people to close their eyes and listen to this album , '' he said .
`` I really do think my effort with the last album was to make people dance , and I think with this album , I wrote a lot of songs that make me want to sing ... and dance . ''
