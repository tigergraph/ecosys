This acoustic song finds Swift reaching for the phone to reconnect with a former boyfriend before deciding she dare not `` risk another goodbye . ''
When The Daily Beast asked Swift whether her songs are autobiographical , she replied : `` Sometimes , I write about my own life .
And sometimes , I write about situations I see my friends going through .
Sometimes , I write about a scene I saw in a movie .
I take inspiration from all different places .
It 's hard to say what different topics inspire me the most .
I think people inspire me the most .
If I meet a person who is incredibly complex and all of a sudden , I start thinking in rhymes , that person could be a muse . ''
