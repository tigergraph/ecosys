Bassist Mani told the Sunday Times that this began life as a fairly standard disco song but gradually took on its unique character - `` Like Jah Wobble playing with Chic . ''
Bobby Gillespie told Q magazine October 2008 that the song `` is about working class culture .
What have you got ?
F -- k all , except going out dancing at the weekend , looking good .
Then you 're back to work and the drudgery on Monday . ''
This song , along with several others on the album , was produced in Stockholm by Bjorn Yttling of the Swedish trio Peter , Bjorn & John .
When recording these tracks they used some of the same instruments as Scandinavia 's greatest pop exports ABBA .
Frontman Bobby Gillespie enthused to The Sun July 11 , 2008 : `` It 's a great studio and also kinda cool .
Abba recorded Knowing Me , Knowing You and Dancing Queen there .
I love all that pop mythology .
On ` Uptown ' and ` The Glory Of Love , ' our drummer Darrin Mooney played the marimba used on 'S .
O.S. ' and ` Money Money Money . '
I thought it was a good omen .
At one point , Bjorn pointed at the grand piano and laughed and laughed before saying ` Dancing Queen . '
He cracked up and so did we . ''
