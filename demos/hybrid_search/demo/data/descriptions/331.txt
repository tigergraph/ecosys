This stomping club number is a track from the self-titled debut solo album from producer and TV on the Radio guitarist Dave Sitek , recorded under the guise of Maximum Balloon .
The song features Yeah Yeah Yeahs front woman Karen O. Sitek told The Guardian : `` Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the first band I produced that people outside my neighbourhood knew about .
That 's when I really had to get my chops together because I knew they were amazing and I did n't want to f -- k it up .
I love working with Karen -- she 's one of the main reasons why I continue to try to push myself and stay creative .
Also she 's like family and I can confide in her .
Anyone who thinks Karen is just some crazy woman is wildly underestimating her talents .
She is extremely complex .
She 's nurturing and encouraging .
When you hear a song such as Maps , her sincerity is audible -- it sounds like she 's singing to you personally , which is astonishing . ''
This was a late addition to the album .
Sitek recalled to Rolling Stone that he invited Karen O to dinner just as the album was wrapping .
`` I was like , ` You know , everyone else is on this record .
If you 're not , that 's kind of lame , ' '' he said .
Sitek told NME about recording this song with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs vocalist .
`` Karen is like my sister , so it felt like a family project when we recorded the song ` Communion ' together , really easy , '' he said .
`` It is more laid-back than her stuff with Yeah Yeah Yeahs .
Her voice is very gentle and intoxicating on the track at times , but then it 's also got some of the yelping we all know and love . ''
