Gaga explained to E !
News that this track from her Born This Way Special Edition album is about how when she moved to downtown New York at the age of nineteen , she was introduced to an entirely new way of thinking that was so different from the way she was taught .
Up till then , iconic imagery had taught her entire life to look at Jesus and religion a certain way .
Black Jesus represents an entirely new way of thinking to her , -LRB- `` Jesus is the new black '' -RRB- , which she believed was caused by meeting new people and seeing new things.She added that the Amen Fashion part of the song concerns how having a new way of seeing is as easy as changing your fashion .
In a post on her Facebook wall , Lady Gaga explained : `` Black Jesus was Justin Timberlake 's favorite .
Its about how putting on a new spirit is as easy as putting on fashion .
Amen . ''
According to Gaga , the two phrases that make up the title are interchangeable .
She had used both phrases in the song , liked them equally , so she decided to use both .
