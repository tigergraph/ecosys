This song is the title track from British rapper Speech Debelle 's debut album .
This song was written partly in response to news , received as she was leaving for Australia , that Debelle 's close friend Frenchy was dying of cancer .
Frenchy died two months after she returned from Melbourne to London .
The album is dedicated to him .
Speech Therapy was the winner of the prestigious 2009 Mercury Prize for the best British album of the year .
The award to Debelle was a surprise to many as at the point when the announcement was made , the British rapper had yet to reach the Official Singles or Albums charts .
It is the lowest-selling album to have ever won the award , selling only around 3000 copies at the time of winning the prize .
Debelle 's real name is Corynne Elliot , she got her pseudonym from her Jamaican grandmother .
This song contains a shout-out to her gran .
Debelle explained to The Sunday Times July 26 , 2009 : `` She 's a fashion designer and a clothes-maker who tells stories like parables .
Her label is called Madame De Belle .
When I was old enough to speak , I 'd answer her phone and go , ` Hello , Madame De Belle Designs , how may I help you ? '
It 's ingrained in me .
My gran 's house is the strangest gran 's house you could ever walk into .
It 's all sewing machines , wall to wall , and that 's where it happens .
She 'll be working at four in the morning , she 'll be there , creating .
And I know what that is now I 'm writing .
I 'll be up then and thinking , ` I 'm on fire . ' ''
Producer Wayne Lotek recalled to The London Times September 10 , 2009 that the lyric : `` Oh Frenchy , stay on this earth longer please/I ca n't believe you 're dying/I ca n't keep from crying , '' `` was n't even supposed to be a take , It was the guide vocal . ''
