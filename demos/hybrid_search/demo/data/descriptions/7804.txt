This was inspired by an upcoming novel by American writer and thinker Mark Z. Danielewski about a 12-year-old girl who finds a kitten .
Frontman Simon Neil told NME : `` I just thought ' A Girl And His Cat ' as a title was HILARIOUS .
Another old-school Biffy one .
Not to sound mean about it but it 's our bread and butter , is n't it ?
You do n't need to stress about it .
It sat right in our pockets just nicely .
`` Danielewski is a favorite author of Simon Neil and Biffy Clyro 's previous album Only Revolutions was also titled after one of his novels .
