Mary Gauthier describes this as `` an adoptee identity crisis song . ''
Her mother was unmarried , and when she gave birth to Mary in 1962 , she put her up for adoption .
Mary always struggled with what she calls an `` orphan feeling , '' and at age 45 , she tracked down her birth mother , only to learn that she had kept Mary a secret and was not willing to start a relationship with her now .
One phone call was the only contact Mary had with her mother .
