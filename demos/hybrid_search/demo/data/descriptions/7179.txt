Two days after giving birth to her first son , Wolfie , London born and Jersey reared singer-songwriter Nerina Pallot had the traumatic experience of seeing him taken to an intensive care ward following a health scare .
Tormented by thoughts of how she 'd carry on without him , she sought catharsis in music .
Pallot told The Sun newspaper : `` We went from the greatest day of our life to the worst .
Wolfie came home and it was all fine but I kept thinking , ` What would happen if something went wrong ? '
I was n't prepared for how much of a roller coasting parenthood would be - so I wrote ` If I Lost You ' about it . ''
Pallot recorded this song quickly with both vocal and instrumentation laid down in one go .
The song features on Pallot 's fourth studio album Year of the Wolf , which was mainly written during her pregnancy and is titled after her now healthy son .
