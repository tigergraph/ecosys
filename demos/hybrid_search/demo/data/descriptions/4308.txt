Having been through a number of relationships where the flame eventually burnt out , Blunt sings here of finally meeting a girl whom he believes will keep the fire in his heart alive .
`` The song is about love , life , fear and hope , '' said the singer when sending out a link to the song stream to fans that belong to his email list , `` and more than anything , you ... and me ... '' The single was premiered on BBC Radio 2 on July 29 , 2013 .
Blunt penned the song with One Republic frontman Ryan Tedder , who doubles up as a successful songwriter/producer .
His credits include Leona Lewis ' transatlantic chart-topper `` Bleeding Love '' and Beyonce 's hit single `` Halo . ''
The song was composed in Luxembourg and Amsterdam , recorded in the US and Sydney and mixed in Los Angeles .
`` So you could say the song has already gone global , '' said Blunt before the track 's release .
The Moon Landing album takes its name from the themes of love and loss Blunt explores throughout .
`` The moon landings were a moment of incredible human achievement that for some , we do n't seem to be able to repeat , '' he said .
`` Like first love . ''
The song topped the charts in several countries , including Austria , Germany and Switzerland .
Blunt explained the story behind the climax of the music clip .
`` We shot the video throughout Wyoming and Idaho over two days using real characters , '' he said , `` and the final scene took place in the car park of a bar , where everyone we 'd met on the journey would meet up and we planned to film a wrap party .
What we did n't know was that in the bar , a wedding was taking place , and when they saw us arrive , the entire wedding piled out and joined us . ''
`` I played them all ` You 're Beautiful ' in the car park on my guitar with the bride and groom pushed to the front by the 80-strong crowd , '' Blunt continued .
`` Then we lit fires and sparklers , put on ` Bonfire Heart , ' and the bride and groom had their first dance to it , which we filmed , and which is now the climax of the video .
In fact , it stopped being my promo video , and became their wedding video . ''
Blunt told Billboard magazine that the song has a simple message that anyone can relate to : `` That notion of connection , '' he explained .
`` So the lyrics are really simple : People like us , we do n't need that much .
Just someone to light the spark in our bonfire heart . ' ''
Blunt told MusicRadar.com about collaborating with Tedder on this tune .
`` Working with Ryan Tedder on Bonfire Heart allowed me to say , ` Let 's make this upbeat , driving song that connects with lots of people , ' '' he said .
`` That was the meaning of the song when we wrote it .
He has the hyperactivity within his musicianship that I wanted . ''
