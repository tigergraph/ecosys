Jennings discussed this fast-paced love tale on his official biography : `` My heart is definitely with the ballads .
But you have to mix and match .
With ` Cops Up ' the hook is great , the beat is great , and I think it 's a song that these kids could get into .
And I think it will allow me to expand my young audience even more . ''
This was originally written for the R&B duo , Luke & Q. Jennings explained why he titled the album Lyfe Change on his website : `` My music has always been positive , touching people socially and emotionally .
But I named this album Lyfe Change because this time I wanted to take it a step further and invoke people to make a change in their lives and in the lives of others .
That 's how we 'll change the world , one life at a time . ''
