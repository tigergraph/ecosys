According to Alt-J frontman Joe Newman , this minimal , ominous track was written about `` the lingering of an old flame and the physical intimacy shared with that particular individual . ''
An Awesome Wave won the 2012 Mercury Prize , which is awarded to the best album from the United Kingdom and Ireland .
The line `` Three guns and one goes off , one 's empty , one 's not quick enough , '' is a nod to the ending of the spaghetti western , The Good , the Bad and The Ugly .
The song 's music video is a modern take on Renaissance painter Raphael 's School of Athens .
Asked by NME why the clip features a rottweiller , keyboardist Gus Unger-Hamilton replied : `` It was meant to be some sort of ` status dog ' I think .
You 'll notice others in a scene are taking pop .
It 's an edgy video . ''
Newman explained the lyric , '' 'Til morning comes , let 's tessellate '' to NME : `` I wrote it when I was going out with my ex-girlfriend , '' he said .
`` I told her it was about spooning , but I 've been telling everyone it 's about sex !
Now I do n't know !
`` He added : `` I started going out with someone else and the song 's about getting over her while I was going out with my new girlfriend .
The line ` Chunks of you will sink down to seals ' is about her memory being ripped apart . ''
This song 's couplet , `` Triangles are my favorite shape .
Three points where two lines meet , '' was voted by readers of NME as their favorite lyric of 2012 .
