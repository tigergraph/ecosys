This was written by Tia Sillers and Mark Sanders .
Sillers also wrote `` There 's Your Trouble '' for The Dixie Chicks and `` Blue On Black '' for Kenny Wayne Shepherd .
Sanders has written several Country hits , including `` Blue Clear Sky '' for George Strait and `` No News '' for Lonestar .
This song is about taking chances and not being afraid to try something new .
Many listeners found it very inspirational , and the simple hook line made it memorable .
In our interview with Bill Withers , who wrote `` Lean On Me , '' he singled out this song as one that says something that everyone can understand and remember : `` There are lines that are so profound ... ` And when the time comes for you to sit it out or dance , I hope you dance . '
Come on man , you ca n't say that any better . ''
After this became a hit , Sillers and Sanders released a book called I Hope You Dance with writings based on the song .
In an interview with Songwriter Universe magazine , Sillers explained that she was going through a painful divorce when she wrote this song .
Said Sillers : `` For ' I Hope You Dance , ' I had written the opening line , ' I hope you never lose your sense of wonder .
I had just broken up with someone , going through a brutal divorce .
I needed to get away , so I went to a beach on the Florida Gulf Coast .
Sitting on the beach and reflecting about the breakup , I felt so small and inconsequential .
But out of this difficult time came the inspiration to write ' I Hope You Dance . '
As I was leaving the beach , I remember thinking that things were n't really so bad , that I would get through it .
That 's when I came up with the line , ' I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean . ' ''
This won the Grammy Award for Best Country Song and also the Country Music Award for Song Of The Year .
It was a # 1 Country hit and also # 1 on the Adult Contemporary charts .
Irish tenor Ronan Keating released a version in 2004 that hit # 2 in the UK .
