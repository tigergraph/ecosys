Jesca Hoop is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist from Northern California .
This tribute to her late mother is a track from her second album , Hunting My Dress .
Dark songs like this one are balanced by more upbeat tracks such as the lively funk beat of `` Four Dreams '' .
`` I 'm real fond of contrast .
I do n't want to be a folk artist , '' Hoop explained to The Independent : `` I 'd rather play characters and have more fun with the medium than stick to a genre . ''
