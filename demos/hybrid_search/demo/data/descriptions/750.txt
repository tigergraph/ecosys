EURweb commented on this track 's similarities to Curtis Mayfield 's music .
Thicke replied that he had no particular creative process , adding : `` It was just the inspiration of the great music of Philly and Motown and the '70s and Gamble and Huff . ''
This song was used on an advert for Samsung mobile phones during the summer of 2008 .
Robin Thicke told the Association Press that this song came about , `` of just the celebration of having that feeling when ` Lost Without U ' finally became a hit , and there was a little release for me , a monkey off my back .
You go out there and see all the people who 've given up on their own dreams and given up on themselves , so I just wanted to write a song that said I got the magic , you got the magic , we all got the magic and we can all bend metal with our minds if we try hard enough . ''
Thicke told EURweb : `` I happened to have written that song when good things were happening to me and I was realizing how much greatness we all have in us and how sometimes the world tries to beat it out of us .
Sometimes you 're expressing your vulnerabilities and sometimes you 're expressing your positive nature and that 's what that is .
Some of us are searching for something bigger internally .
I think my music tends to connect with a lot of those people that are searching for something else . ''
Robin Thicke 's parents are Gloria Loring , who had a hit in 1986 with `` Friends and Lovers , '' and the actor and games show host Alan Thicke .
His mother and father wrote several theme songs together for TV shows including Brush Strokes .
