JCB is a company that makes construction equipment .
In the December 16 , 2005 Daily Mail , guitarist and singer Luke Concannon said : `` The single is based on a true story .
My family run a construction firm , building roads .
As a youngster , I 'd often sit in the -LRB- JCB -RRB- diggers with my dad .
We 'd have a great laugh , singing songs and holding up the traffic as we drove down country roads .
It 's a song about memories , essentially .
It 's about me feeling proud of my dad , but also about the emotions of a 5-year-old boy who is having a tough time with bullies at school .
Sitting in my dad 's digger was a release from that . ''
Luke Concannon on BBC3 's 100 Most Annoying Songs : `` It 's a song from that really strong vivid memory of being young and being with my Dad in a digger and holding up the traffic spaceship and imagining it turning into a spaceship and destroying all the bullies and teachers . ''
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England , for all above -RRB- Nizlopi is the duo of Luke Concannon and bassist John Parker .
They formed in 2001 , taking their name from a Hungarian schoolgirl , Nina Nizlopi , who they both fancied during their teenage years in their hometown of Leamington Spa near Birmingham in England .
A teenage Ed Sheeran was Nizlopi 's guitar technician in the late 2000s .
`` I followed them to every gig , '' he told The Mail on Sunday .
`` After a while they were like , ` OK , do you want a job ? '
So , rather than following them about , I was in a van with them .
That experience -- seeing how they performed , how they interacted with their fans and how professional they were backstage -- was the foundation for what 's happening to me now .
It 's all about hard work , graft and being nice to people .
That 's the best way to do it . ''
