Written by Clint Ballard , Jr. , this was originally recorded by Betty Everett .
Ballard also wrote songs for Connie Francis and The Hollies .
Everett was a former Gospel singer who , like Ronstandt , had a powerful voice , but her version went nowhere .
Everett 's next single , `` The Shoop Shoop Song -LRB- It 's In His Kiss -RRB- , '' was her biggest hit.The original Betty Everett version was recorded in 1963 at Chess Records , and was one of the first songs Maurice White played on .
White , who later formed Earth , Wind & Fire , was a staff drummer at Chess early in his career .
Van Halen recorded this for their second album .
It was one of many successful cover songs by Van Halen ; Others include Roy Orbison 's `` Pretty Woman , '' The Kinks ' `` You Really Got Me , '' and Martha & the Vandellas ' `` Dancing in the Street . ''
This is the only cover on the album .
Between 1978-1983 , Van Halen released an album a year .
Since they toured constantly , including cover songs on the albums helped ease the songwriting burden .
Emmylou Harris sang backup on this .
