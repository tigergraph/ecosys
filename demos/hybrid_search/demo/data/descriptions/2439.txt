This track finds Marling addressing her lover with a curled lip : `` Give me something .
Let me go .
Tell me something I do n't know . ''
The Observer asked the singer if this is how she approaches relationships ?
`` I sound awful saying it but I think it can be like that , '' Marling replied .
`` I see a lot of people in unstimulating relationships .
And not just boyfriend-girlfriend relationships .
They find themselves in stagnant friendships .
If people were a little less scared -LSB- of ending things -RSB- they 'd get more out of life ... You meet the right person at the right time and they fulfil a certain something in your life .
You fulfil something in theirs .
But there 's a time limit to that .
Unless you choose to be bloody good company for the rest of your life , do you know what I mean ? ''
