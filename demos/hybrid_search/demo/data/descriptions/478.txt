Dylan originally wrote this bleak ballad for the 2009 Ren√©e Zellweger starring movie My Own Love Song .
The film was directed by Olivier Dahan , who helmed the 2007 Edith Piaf biopic La Vie En Rose .
Dylan apparently loved Dahan 's Piaf story and when approached for a ballad for the main character to sing towards the end of the Frenchman 's next feature , he readily agreed .
After completing this song , an inspired Dylan kept writing and he produced nine more tunes , which made up Together Through Life .
In an article published on his website , Bill Flanagan commented to Dylan that this song `` has the formality of an old Rudy Vallee or Nelson Eddy ballad right down to the middle eight . ''
The interviewer asked Dylan , whether if he starts a song in that style , does he stick with the rules right down the line ?
He replied : `` Sure , I try to stick to the rules .
Sometimes I might shift paradigms within the same song , but then that structure also has its own rules .
And I combine them both , see what works and what does n't .
My range is limited .
Some formulas are too complex and I do n't want anything to do with them . ''
Dylan co-wrote the lyrics on this song and most of the other numbers on the album with Robert Hunter .
The poet is best known for his association with Grateful Dead and he previously collaborated with on the Minnesota man 's 1988 set Down in the Groove .
Together Through Life was Bob Dylan 's first album to top the UK album charts since 1970 's New Morning .
It also reached the summit of the Billboard 200 and at 67 years and eleven months Dylan became the oldest artist to reach # 1 in both the UK and US .
In doing so he eclipsed Neil Diamond , who was a mere 67 years and four months when he reached the peak position in both territories in 2008 .
