Demi co-write this sober soul-searching number with John Mayer .
Lovato and Mayer penned two songs together but the second one they wrote , `` Shut Up and Love Me '' was left off the album for unknown reasons .
The teenage pop star told MTV News that she did n't have to work very hard to convince Mayer to work with her , since it was he who made the effort .
She explained : `` I guess he had heard I was a huge fan , and he sent me a letter .
Then we ended up writing together .
And it was really great , 'cause he actually reached out to me , and it was like a dream come true . ''
Demi added : `` The process of the collaboration was actually really funny , because he 's a really , really funny guy , and he talks a lot , so he 'll go off on something .
I had a great time .
He taught me a lot about the business and gave me a lot of advice . ''
