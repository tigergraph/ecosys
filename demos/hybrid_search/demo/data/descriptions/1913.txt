Frontman Guy Garvey told the Manchester Evening News that this song , inspired in part by the Manchester skyline , has a very similar theme to `` The Bones of You . ''
He explained : `` I like the idea that a tower crane driver is higher paid than the people on the ground but completely on his own .
He has to start a bit early to get up there and work a bit later because it takes him longer to get down .
I thought it was a good metaphor for ambition .
Well-paid , but high and dry . ''
