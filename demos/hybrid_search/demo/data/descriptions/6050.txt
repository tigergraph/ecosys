Monroe penned this raucous cut when she was a teenager .
It tells the tale of a woman who is fed up with romance and longs to spice things up with her significant other .
Monroe recalled to The Boot : `` When I wrote that song , I was 19 !
We were laughing that whole co-write , with -LSB- writers -RSB- Sally Barris and John McElroy .
I was saying , ` Let 's just go there . '
`` She added : `` People are either going to love me or hate me for it .
But I 'm going to sing about what I 'm going to sing about .
If people ca n't laugh at it or take a joke , they can listen to something else . ''
Producer Vince Gill began work on Like a Rose by listening to Monroe 's catalogue , which the singer had been compiling since she was 14 years old .
Gill exerted a little bit of pressure for her to record this unconventional love song .
`` I said , ` We do this song or I 'm walking ! ' ''
he remembered , with a smile .
`` I would hate to see them miss the boat because it 's talking about pot or whatever .
The humor in it is outstanding , and that 's more in line with the rowdy side of The Pistol Annies . ''
The music video finds Monroe and her band performing the song on a set designed to appear like that from a 1970s TV show .
`` I wanted to do something performance-driven that was light and fun and not literal , '' director David McClister explained .
`` We were able to locate several vintage video cameras from the era -LSB- Ikegamis -RSB- .
Using the cameras from the period gave us a look unlike anything currently on television .
I wanted our finished video to feel like an artifact from 1971 -- an archival piece of video that had been re-discovered from the vaults of a local TV station . ''
Monroe 's experiences as a member of The Pistol Annie helped give her the confidence to record such a bold song .
`` The Pistol Annies showed me that I 'm not the only one who has these thoughts , '' she said .
`` I just have country in my soul .
I ca n't apologize for that anymore .
The Pistol Annies has given me a boost of confidence , or reaffirmation , that it 's OK to be original and to be you , because people will accept it . ''
Monroe explained the song 's origins during a listening party for Like a Rose : `` I talk to myself a lot , in my head , '' she said .
`` On the way to this writing session , I heard , ` Give me weed instead of roses . '
I got real tickled .
Sally 's just a beautiful writer , a beautiful singer , beautiful soul from Minnesota .
But she 's real dainty .
-LSB- John -RSB- is not dainty -LSB- laughs -RSB- .
He 's hardcore .
So , I went in and I said to them , ' I just heard the craziest thing in my head : ` Give me weed instead of roses . '
John was like , ' I love it ! '
and Sally said -LSB- affecting a ` dainty ' voice -RSB- , ` Oh , that 's funny . '
So we wrote this song . ''
The colorful suits that Monroe and her band members wear in the video were designed created by legendary Nashville tailor Manuel .
The `` Rhinestone Rembrandt '' has created clothing for many of music 's biggest stars , from Kid Rock to Glen Campbell and Johnny Cash .
