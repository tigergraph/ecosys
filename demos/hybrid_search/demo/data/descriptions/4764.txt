-LRB- thanks , Brian - Paoli , IN , for all above -RRB- Mad Season was a collaboration of artists from the Grunge era .
Layne Staley on vocals from Alice In Chains , Mike McCready on guitar from Pearl Jam , Martin Barrett from the Screaming Trees on drums .
They first played together at a show where the audience had no idea who the band was and expected them to be just some newcomers .
