This is the title track of the third album of indie rock group Band of Horses .
Singer Ben Bridwell told The Skinny : `` This song deals a lot with the major theme of the record , and being the title track that 's maybe a little obvious , but this is one I 'm not quite ready to unveil the mask on .
But I can tell you that it almost did n't make the record . ''
