This song was an amalgamation of several bits of songs/melodies/lyrics / themes that Taylor had laying around as kernels for future songs that never quite made themselves known to him .
He had a deadline to meet for completing Sweet Baby James , and stuck these loose themes together to make a single `` Suite '' and get the $ 20,000 -LRB- 20G -RRB- advance for getting the album done on time .
