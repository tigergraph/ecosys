Allen explained the song as , `` about getting into a fight and saying , ` I 've done everything I can do .
I know that I 'm wrong , but I 'm too stubborn to admit it . ' ''
He added : `` I think a lot of people can relate to that .
I want people to hear the songs and think , ` I 've been through that .
Kris is like me . '
Because I am . ''
