Frontman Kevin Parker explained the meaning of this song to NME : `` This self-mantra of someone who 's just experienced something that has really shaken them and is trying to block out the idea that they 're worthless and terrible . ''
According to an American Songwriter magazine article , Parker did n't have access to a drum kit while he was recording this song , so he used instead a drum sample from Tame Impala 's Innerspeaker album .
He ran the sample through a Roland Space Echo unit , and built the song around the new drum loop .
The song features the sounds of a person walking .
It was recorded by Parker on a Dictaphone that he stuck out of a window at a hotel that he was staying at .
