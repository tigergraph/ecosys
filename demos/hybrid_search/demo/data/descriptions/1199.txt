This song was written by a New York songwriter named Stefani Germanotta .
Sounds familiar ?
Stefani Germanotta is of course the real name of a certain Lady Gaga .
Before she found fame and fortune as an internationally famous recording star , Germanotta was hired by Sony/ATV Music Publishing as a songwriter to pen songs for Britney Spears , New Kids on the Block , Fergie , and the Pussycat Dolls .
This song was a bonus track on the European iTunes version of Spears ' Circus album -LRB- except for in the UK and France -RRB- .
The LP was released at the time when Gaga 's debut single `` Just Dance '' was climbing the charts .
Germanotta wrote another song , `` Telephone , '' for Circus , which never made it onto the final track listing .
Asked in an interview with Howard Stern if she was peeved that `` Telephone '' was rejected by Spears , Gaga said , `` Hell no !
Frickin ' Britney Spears sang my record !
I was doing back flips and ordering drinks !
`` Gaga later successfully recorded `` Telephone , '' for her own Fame Monster album .
