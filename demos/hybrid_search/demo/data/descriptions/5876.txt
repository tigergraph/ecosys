The Who had 10 minutes left to fill on the LP .
Kit Lambert , The Who 's manager , suggested to Pete Townshend that he write `` something linear ... perhaps a 10 minute song . ''
Townshend responded by saying that rock songs are `` 2:50 by tradition ! ''
Lambert then told Townshend that he should write a 10 minute story comprised of 2:50 songs .
The plot of the story is simple .
A girl is sad that her boyfriend is away .
Her friends suggest that she take a substitute lover , Ivor The Engine Driver .
When the boyfriend returns , she confesses her infidelity and is forgiven .
According to legend , Rock And Roll Circus did n't air because the Rolling Stones felt that they were showed up by The Who .
Jethro Tull , Taj Mahal , Marianne Faithful , John Lennon , Eric Clapton , and Mitch Mitchell all appeared on Rock And Roll Circus .
The Who wanted to put Cellos on the track but Kit Lambert said they could n't afford it .
So they sang `` cello , cello , cello , cello , '' where the Who thought they should go .
-LRB- thanks , James - Ashland , OR -RRB- The song was a `` mini-opera , '' paving the way for the other mini-opera `` Rael '' and eventually full length rock operas Tommy and Quadrophenia .
The Who performed this on the Rolling Stones Rock And Roll Circus , which was going to be a TV special .
It never aired on television but it was released on VHS in 1996 and DVD in 2004 .
The Who 's performance of this was included in The Kids Are Alright , a 1979 film about The Who .
A live version of this song appears on Live At Leeds and the soundtrack for The Kids Are Alright .
