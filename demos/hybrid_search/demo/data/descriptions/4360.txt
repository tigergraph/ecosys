The most un-Springsteenish track on Wrecking Ball opens with a sample of archivist Alan Lomax 's 1942 field recording of `` I 'm A Soldier in the Army of the Lord '' by the Church of God in Christ Congregation before slowly building into a solemn gospel ballad .
It features gospel singer Michelle Moore who not only provides backing vocals on this song , but also contributes a 16 bar rap , which Springsteen wrote himself .
The most overtly gospel influenced song on Wrecking Ball , the lyrics evoke biblical language , as Springsteen sings over a church organ and the Victorious Gospel Choir , of whom Michelle Moore is a member : `` Rise up , shepherd , rise up/Your flock has roamed far from the hill '' .
The title itself alludes to Jesus ' parable in Matthew chapter 13 vs. 5 & 20-21 in which he talks of seed falling on rocky ground .
Christ is referring to people who initially receive his message -LRB- the seed -RRB- enthusiastically , but because it fell on rocky ground , they have no roots and they fall away when times get hard .
The song reflects the influence of co-producer Rob Aniello , who incorporated various electronic drums and loops into the production .
Springsteen noted at the unveiling of Wrecking Ball in Paris that during the recording process he was happy to try something different .
`` I could go anywhere , do anything , use anything .
It was very wide open , '' he said .
