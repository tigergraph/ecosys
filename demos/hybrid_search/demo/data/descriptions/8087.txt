This epic thirteen and a half minute track is divided into four parts and was inspired by Nightwish keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen 's favorite poet Walt Whitman -LRB- 1819 -- 1892 -RRB- , and his famous free verse poem of the same name .
The song includes a six-minute recitation of the Transcendentalist poem .
He explained to Metal Hammer magazine : `` I wanted to pay homage to him and do the lyrics in a way that he would possibly write .
It 's a real , open , thorough , personal catharsis -- especially the spoken-word part . ''
