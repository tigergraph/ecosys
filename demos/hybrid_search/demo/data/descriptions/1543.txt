The lyrics to the song are an affirmation of who we are in Christ .
Frontman Bart Millard explained : `` The song is a reminder to me that we are not just people who happen to know Christ ; the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead lives inside of us .
We have Something inside of us that should blow our minds ... ` You are I Am ' is a reminder of who we used to be , and then the chorus talks all about how big and powerful the Spirit who lives inside of us really is . ''
