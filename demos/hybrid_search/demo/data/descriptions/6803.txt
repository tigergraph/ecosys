The lyric , `` You 're hanging with a crowd .
A load of cheats and liars , '' was taken from the Channel 4 comedy Father Ted .
Ricky Wilson explained to NME : `` There 's a line in Father Ted where he 's at an awards ceremony for priest of the year or something and he 's going ` and now , moving on to cheats and liars . ' ''
