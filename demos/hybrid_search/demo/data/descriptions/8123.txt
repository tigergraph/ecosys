This is a cover of a song that was originally a US chart-topper for Rock group Poison in 1988-89 .
The first concert Miley ever attended was by Poison , which introduced her to Rock and Roll .
Cyrus explained in a blog that she decided to cover the track after hearing a bunch of people around her singing along to it .
She decided that she wanted to give a whole new generation of music lovers the chance to hear the song .
`` It 's a song that everyone knows and loves , '' she said .
`` I feel like the way the music industry is today really shelters kids and they are n't exposed to songs as honest and real as this one . ''
Miley recalled : `` Bret and I had a great time in the studio together just hanging out and making music .
It was so surreal to have him sit down with his acoustic guitar and walk me through ` Every Rose ' and then give me the opportunity to add my own flare and edge to it .
Bret is so passionate about music and it shows . ''
Cyrus got together with the lead singer and songwriter of Poison , Bret Michaels , to consult him .
He guided her through the song , played guitar on the hook and sung back-up harmonies while John Shanks contributed behind the production desk .
Michaels noted to MTV News that Cyrus `` nailed the song .
She really knew what she was doing . ''
He added , `` She got in there and picked the guitar up .
It was one of those nights that just worked .
It was fun .
It 's got ta be her taking ` Every Rose ' and making it all hers . ''
