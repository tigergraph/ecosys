Nicks -LRB- from the liner notes in TimeSpace -RRB- : `` To understand this song , you sort of have to let yourself go a little crazy .
Love is blind , it never works out , but you just have to have it .
I think this was about the most exciting song that I had ever heard .
My friend , Rick , whom I had known since I was 18 and he was 13 , brought over this track with this incredible percussion thing , and gave it to me asking me if I would listen to it and consider writing a song for it .
I listened to the song once , and pretended not to be that knocked out , but the second Rick left , I ran in my little recording studio and wrote ' I Ca n't Wait . '
It took all night , and I think it is all about how electric I felt about this music .
And that night , that SATURDAY night , Rick and I went into a BIG studio and recorded it .
I sang it only once , and have never sung it since in the studio .
Some vocals are magic and simply not able to beat .
So I let go of it , as new to me as it was ; but you know , now when I hear it on the radio , this incredible feeling comes over me , like something really incredible is about to happen .
`` Nicks ' `` friend , Rick '' was Rick Nowels .
This was the first Hot 100 entry for the songwriter , but he would go on to become one of pop music 's leading tunesmiths , crafting memorable hooks for the likes of Belinda Carlisle -LRB- `` Heaven Is A Place On Earth , '' Madonna -LRB- `` The Power Of Goodbye '' -RRB- and Lana Del Rey -LRB- `` Summertime Sadness '' -RRB- .
Nicks says that she did drugs on the set of all her videos of the era , and in this one -LRB- directed by Marty Callner -RRB- , it shows .
`` I look at that video , I look at my eyes , and I say to myself , ` Could you have laid off the pot , the coke , and the tequila for three days , so you could have looked a little better ?
, ' '' she said in the book I Want My MTV .
`` It just makes me want to go back into that video and stab myself . ''
