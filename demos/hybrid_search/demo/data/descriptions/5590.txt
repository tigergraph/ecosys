This tribute to the satisfactions of manual labor is the opening track from Country music artist Alan Jackson 's sixteenth studio album , Freight Train .
The song is one of eight on the disc penned by Jackson .
Jackson has an unusual musical credit on this track .
He explained to The Boot : `` I get a credit on this album -LSB- as a musician -RSB- .
I play the anvil .
` Hard Hat and a Hammer ' has an anvil in there .
I said , ` Man , this thing needs somebody hitting an anvil with a hammer .
-LSB- Producer Keith Stegall -RSB- came out to the house one day with his engineer because I 've got an anvil that was my daddy 's .
It 's mounted on a telephone pole and the back of it 's broken off .
He got it when he worked for the county farm .
They gave it to him because it was broken , I guess .
It stayed in our garage my whole life , daddy 's shop garage .
Man , I beat on a lot of parts and steel on that thing , and he did too .
When he died , I got a lot of his stuff .
And that anvil 's in my car museum garage there .
Keith came out and we took a hammer and it did n't sound right .
Finally , we had to get two or three hammers and found one that sounded right .
That 's what 's on the record .
I sat there and beat on that anvil , so I get that credit ... the hammer that worked was a hammer that had a steel handle instead of the wood .
That 's the one that sounded best .
I think you hear the hammer more than you hear the anvil ! ''
Jackson explained to The Boot why he kicked off this song and the album with some fiddles .
He said : `` I love that fiddle kick-off .
I just knew when he first played that when we were recording , I said , ` That 's gon na start the album . '
Not that I 'm trying to shove it in somebody 's face , but I just liked that that it was so simple , just the fiddle by itself . ''
