Richie Sambora closes his third solo album Aftermath of the Lowdown with this track , which he wrote with his pal Bruce Foster , the guy who first got the Bon Jovi guitarist into the music business .
He recalled to Artist Direct : `` He had a deal on Casablanca Records .
I was in college , and I 'd play with him .
He 'd pull me into sessions as a guitar player .
I played with his band .
He was the real first pro I ever played with .
I 've written lots of songs with him on my other solo albums , and he 's written for other artists also . ''
Sambora and Foster wrote this about five years before he laid it down for Aftermath of the Lowdown .
`` I remembered the melody , '' Sambora recalled to Artist Direct .
`` It 's like an adult lullaby .
It 's begging the world for forgiveness because humanity has f -- ked it up -LSB- Laughs -RSB- . ''
