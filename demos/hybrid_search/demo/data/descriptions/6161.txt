Ray Dorset , who was the group 's lead singer and guitarist , wrote this song .
This sold over 16 million copies worldwide and was Britain 's biggest-selling single in 1970 .
Later on , it was used regularly in many different commercials and became one of the most recognizable songs .
Many years later , it became the world 's most-played radio song and the most successful summer song ever .
The words `` In the summertime '' appear only twice : in the first line and near the end .
