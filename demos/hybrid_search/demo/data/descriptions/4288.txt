This defiant survivor 's song is a bonus track on Hole 's fourth studio album , Nobody 's Daughter .
Courtney Love penned the tune when she was in rehab .
It was written from the point of being broken , and she vows not to repeat the mistakes of the past .
Love told Spinner UK that when she started writing for Nobody 's Daughter , she wanted it to be like Bob Dylan 's 1975 album , Blood on the Tracks , which was penned during his separation from his then wife Sara Dylan , but this is the only song left over from that period .
Said Love : `` It started off trying to be Blood on the Tracks .
It started off trying to be that midlife crisis -LSB- Bob -RSB- Dylan record and it did n't end up being that other than a song called ` Never Go Hungry , ' which was one of the first songs that I wrote in '05 in rehab . ''
