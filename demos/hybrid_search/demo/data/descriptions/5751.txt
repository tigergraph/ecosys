This was the final track of French rock band Phoenix 's fourth studio album , Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix .
Phoenix vocalist Thomas Mars commented to the Washington DC free newspaper Express : `` With the track listing you always know the beginning and the end of every record .
We pay attention to the last lyric of the last song because it leaves you with a very strong impression .
And this had the most poignant lyrics for a finish .
You want to end up with something that ends up with a little weight . ''
