Following the release of her debut album Santogold in 2008 , the alternative American singer-songwriter born Santi White spent the next two years touring .
When she returned to start work on her sophomore release in early 2010 , Santigold was , according to publicity materials , `` totally exhausted and had not written anything yet . ''
She was also unsure of her songwriting skills : `` I had to find my way back to the place where my inspiration comes from , '' the singer explained .
`` It was like , ` Am I good at writing songs ? '
And there was nobody to be like , ` Yeah ! '
`` Two years later , Santigold was finally ready to release this first single from her second album Master Of My Make-Believe .
It is an inspirational song about looking to the future whilst refusing to conform .
`` A life worth fighting for , '' she sings .
It took Santigold three months to write the lyrics .
`` Lyrically , I was trying to talk about what I want for the world and what I want people to be , '' she explained to MTV News .
`` The youth are the hope of the future , and I want people to have the courage to trust their own vision and instincts and make up the truth for themselves and question what 's told to them . ''
The song originated with a beat sent to Santigold by producer Ricky Blaze .
She told MTV News how it reminded her of a boat trip that she 'd taken with John Hill and Diplo , whom she worked with on her debut album , Santogold .
`` We were going really fast on this speedboat , '' the singer recalled , `` and I was just holding on , sitting cross-legged on the very front of the boat , and my body was just , like , flying , like I could have been thrown off at any minute .
And this guy was playing this old reggae through these little speakers , and it was blown out and distorted , and it was such a visual memory that stayed with me , and this song kind of felt like that . ''
