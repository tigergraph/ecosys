In this song , a couple make up after a nasty fight , dreaming of an idyllic life together .
The music video plays up the `` escape '' angle , as Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are seen in jail , eventually breaking out with the help of Akon .
-LRB- thanks , Donovan Berry - El Dorado , AR , for above 2 -RRB- Stefani wrote this with Akon , who sings on it with her .
Jimmy Iovine from Stefani 's label Interscope Records set up the collaboration .
Once they got together , the song fell in place quickly .
This song got a huge boost after Stefani and Akon performed it on the TV show American Idol .
-LRB- thanks , Kye - Tullahoma , TN -RRB-
