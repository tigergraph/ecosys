This is a track from W.ants W.orld W.omen , the fourth studio album by soul singer-songwriter Dwele .
The project is split into three sections , the first focusing on his alter ego -LRB- Wants -RRB- , the middle part -LRB- World -RRB- addresses current events and the last -LRB- Women -RRB- , is classic `` baby-making music . ''
Dewle told MTV News about the middle section : `` It 's an audio time capsule of things going on in the world right now or with the economy , across the world and in our country the past few years , '' he explained .
`` I 've had a few songs for a few years now that I wanted to get out , and I really did n't have the platform to get those out .
So I felt like making a specific section on this album .
It kind of came as an outlet or gave me the role to finally do it . ''
