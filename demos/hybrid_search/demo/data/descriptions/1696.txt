This song is about how people believe they will always have to work or are constantly ordered to do stuff and not getting enough out of it to live .
The lyrics , `` Anchor is part of the desk '' means that this attitude starts right away in school and most people continue working way too hard in unfulfilling jobs their whole lives - only the rich can escape it .
-LRB- thanks , Jeff - Cheektowaga , NY -RRB- This song deals with the pressures of working life , with allusions to suicide : `` These ties strangle our necks '' and `` Hanging in the closest . ''
It touches on how people are just numbers in giant organizations `` With out no name just numbers on the resume stored in the mainframe marked for delete . ''
