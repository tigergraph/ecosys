This was written by the American singer-songwriter Will Oldham .
He recorded it for the title track of his 1999 sixth album , the first on which he used his ` Bonnie Prince Billy ' moniker .
Oldham provided background vocals for Cash 's Rick Rubin produced version , which can be found on American III : Solitary Man .
Cash 's health prior to the recording of American III : Solitary Man had been poor and he 'd even been hospitalized for pneumonia .
The album contained the Man in Black 's response to his illness .
Mojo asked Oldham if he felt spooky that someone who was seriously ill was singing about darkness ?
He replied : `` No , it did n't , because the song is about seeing darkness and asking for friendship and support ... it seemed good he was singing the song ... at that time -LRB- it seemed like -RRB- an essential statement . ''
Oldham recalled Cash covering his song to Mojo October 2013 : `` I actually heard about my song being on the album from a friend of mine who plays guitar with me , '' he said ; `` He 'd talked to Rick Rubin who said , ` Oh yeah , Johnny Cash just recorded I see a darkness . '
A couple of weeks later I met Rick and we arranged I could meet Johnny Cash .
And when I did , Johnny said , ' I want to redo my vocals on that song , Why do n't we work on it together ?
That was really exciting , and we did it that same day , worked together on ' I See a Darkness . ' ''
`` It was a situation we were both very comfortable with , which is working on music , '' Oldham continued .
`` We only spoke when we had something to say that the other person wanted to hear , so it was one of the few times when I actually felt I was in the correct company .
And that 's not trying to give myself excessive grace .
He would ask the questions about the song ; a couple of grammatical questions he wanted to clear up . ''
