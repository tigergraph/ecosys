On this melancholic number , which Currington wrote together with Tony Martin and Mark Nesler , the Country singer pleads to a lover not to move to a city with cold weather and a terrible football team .
He told AOL : `` When it came time to record this one , I was reminded of it by my publishing company , so I revisited it and remembered how special it was to me , and how it meant a lot to me , and how I think it relates to a lot of people 's relationships -- mine for sure -- how people decide at a moment in time that they think they need to move on , and how I could think of nine million reasons why they should n't .
That 's how this one came about . ''
