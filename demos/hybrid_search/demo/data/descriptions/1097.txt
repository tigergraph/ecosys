The lyrics for this song came from a poem that Annie Lennox had written .
Musically , her bandmate Dave Stewart wanted to create a song that would play well in an arena setting , as he was inspired by the concert films Under A Blood Red Sky by U2 and Stop Making Sense by Talking Heads .
British synthesizer bands were n't crossing over to big arena shows , and Stewart wanted to buck the trend .
He wrote in The Dave Stewart Songbook : `` Missionary Man opened the album and became a lynchpin song on the Revenge tour .
I wanted to create a spiritual feeling at the opening of the song .
I felt like an alchemist cooking up a weird brew of Blues , Rock and Voodoo , with a strange mixture of guitars , synthesizers , backwards noises , and harmonica that spiraled toward the opening line , ` Well I was born an original sinner . '
This was the perfect way to take our shows to another level . ''
This won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal .
