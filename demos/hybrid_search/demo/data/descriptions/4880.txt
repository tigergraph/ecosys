Most of the track evolved from a jam session the band had at the studio while they were bladdered .
That 's how the basic loop of bass and drums came out .
Brian May then added lyrics and melody , the latter being surprisingly similar to `` We Will Rock You '' -LRB- compare `` Buddy you 're a boy make a big noise playing in the street '' with `` Take me to the room where the red 's all red take me '' -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , sebas - Tokyo , Japan -RRB-
