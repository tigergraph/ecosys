There are 3 persons in this song : Maynard Keenan , the Doctor , and the Dead Man .
The setting int stated , but since the Dead Man is lying down -LRB- Maynard leans over him -RRB- it could be in a hospital most likely .
We just know there is a doctor .
The first event is the passing of the Dead Man -LRB- where and when , who knows -RRB- , and the second event is the span of the song recounting Maynard 's attempts at a resuscitation of sorts .
Now , the questions should be : Are the 3 participants representing any particular people or groups of people ?
What motivates Maynard to awaken the Dead Man ?
How do you reconcile passive-aggression with being dead ?
These questions will lead you to the meaning of this song .
Understanding passive-aggression and what that type of strategy stems from will give you insight into this song .
The tragedy for Maynard 's character is that it was his own antagonism for the Dead Man that caused the Dead Man 's eventual killing of Maynard .
-LRB- thanks , randolf - greenville , NC -RRB- This song began as a creation of the Maynard James Keenan/Trent Reznor -LRB- Nine Inch Nails -RRB- project known as Tapeworm .
