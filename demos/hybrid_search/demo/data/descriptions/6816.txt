Scars On 45 is an English indie rock band , who are fronted by former Huddersfield Town junior footballer Danny Bemrose .
After being ignored by the British music industry for several years , the band secured a deal with the US with Chop Shop Records , a division of Atlantic Records .
This bonus track from their self-titled debut album finds Bemrose voicing his frustrations at Scars On 45 's early years of struggle .
He told Rick Florino of Artist Direct : `` Where we come from , there were all of these bands getting signed and doing really .
However , to me , they seemed really fake , and I knew they were fake .
They 'd put an image across with their band because it was deemed `` cool '' or it was what NME wanted them to say .
They were talking about things they did n't really know much about .
The song concerns that .
It 's me sticking the middle finger up at a people who are really fake .
I 've changed my opinion a little bit , but I do think a lot of bands say things in interviews to draw attention to themselves that are n't necessary .
They say it to sell records .
We believe you just have to be yourself .
We try to be nice to people .
We 're under no illusion that we 're doing anything groundbreaking or pushing the boundaries in regards to our music .
We 're just writing songs , playing in a band , and doing what we enjoy .
Hopefully , people like them !
However , we 're not going to try to sell records or draw attention to ourselves by saying something we do n't know anything about . ''
