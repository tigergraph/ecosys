Kingston explained to Blues and Soul magazine that on this song he 's saying , `` it 's taken me so long to get here - to be living my dream doing music - that I ca n't just let it slip away .
You know , I refuse to let my career go down the drain . ''
Kingston told Artistdirect.com the story behind this song : `` Basically , you and your girl have built up an amazing relationship .
Anybody who 's been in a long-term relationship , over two or three years , can relate to this .
After all that time , all of a sudden a little something happens , and she wants to leave -- even though it took so long to build it up .
Most of my songs go in two directions .
That song tells this story .
You and your girl have been together for a long time and suddenly she says , `` I do n't want to be with you anymore '' over something little .
She 's ready to leave , but you 're saying to her , `` It took so long .
We 've been grinding it out , arguing and getting our kinks out , and now you 're ready to leave ? ''
It took so long to get here , why do you want to go ?
Then , on the other hand , it could be a metaphor for me .
I 'm on my second album .
I 'm glad I made it here , and I refuse to let everything go .
People said I would n't be able to come back that I was just going to be a one-hit-wonder for `` Beautiful Girls . ''
Then `` Fire Burning '' dropped , and it was a huge hit .
It took so long for me to get my dream that I 'm not going to let it go .
The song can go in both directions . ''
