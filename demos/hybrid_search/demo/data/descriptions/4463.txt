This is the first single from American rapper Twista 's eighth studio album , The Perfect Storm .
The song features Chris Brown and was produced by Travisty .
The song finds the quick-tongued rapper rhyming about making a sex tape .
Twista told MTV News about his collaboration with Chris Brown : `` It was just a groove that I really felt , the whole vibe of the song , '' he said .
`` It was something that fit the criteria of what I wanted to come with as far as my next single , as far as me making the sexy jams and being able to come like that .
So when I heard the song , I knew it was a jam we could really work with .
By the time it came around to get Chris Brown on it , I was like , ` Man , we got to put the homie Chris on it . '
`` Twista added : `` When he heard the song , he immediately jumped on it , as far as the mutual respect he had for me .
When I got it back , I listened to it one time , and we knew it was a wrap .
We knew we had to roll with it , because it was a jam .
It 's sexy to the people .
Whenever we play it for different people we try to catch a vibe from , they always like it , so I knew it was the one for me . ''
An earlier version of this joint featured T-Pain 's voice instead of Brown 's .
