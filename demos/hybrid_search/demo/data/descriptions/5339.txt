Lead guitarist Will Nutter explained this song to The Alternative Press : `` I had co-written this song with -LSB- producer -RSB- Xandy Barry .
Before we started , we brainstormed where we could take it , and we both agreed that most every guy on this planet has come across a girl who has completely destroyed him .
We took that idea and ran with it . ''
