Patty Griffin 's father died in 2009 , and many of the tracks on American Kid find the singer trying to make sense of the absence of his physical presence .
This song , for instance , finds Griffin imagining a carefree afterworld .
`` It occurred to me that there 's another way to look at this besides my own grief , which is : They 're OK .
They do n't have to pay bills anymore-no taxes ! ''
she told Billboard magazine with a laugh .
This is a very uplifting and positive song written from the point of view of someone who has just lost a loved one .
In this case , it was Griffin 's father , and as he was very close to her , it sparked a lot of emotions on this album .
Griffin has said that American Kid is solely dedicated to the memory of her father .
It is a song in which she imagines what heaven would be like - a carefree world , with no more bills to pay or having to go to war .
She uses this song as a way of letting her father go , recognizing that he must be in a better place by now .
Writing the album was a way for Griffin to reconcile all the things she wanted to ask her dad , but never got the chance to .
