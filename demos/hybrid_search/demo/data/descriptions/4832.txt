When asked to describe what the song meant in a Paramore fan club web-chat , Hayley Williams of Paramore said : `` After we went through some crazy stuff last year and the beginning of this year , it was like ... I just felt , and sometimes I still feel , like I just kinda do n't know ... you know , when things are so familiar for so long and then all of a sudden it 's not that way anymore you kind of have to figure out ` What is life ? '
all over again , so that 's what it 's about .
It 's also just about realizing that the world is sometimes crap .
Not that that 's very helpful ! ''
-LRB- thanks , Lauren - Aberdeen , United Kingdom -RRB- In late 2011 Paramore set up a `` Singles Club '' on their website giving fans the opportunity to purchase three exclusive tracks , which was not available on iTunes or in stores .
This song was released on November 7 , 2011 as the second single for members of the `` Paramore Singles Club . ''
The song is a rallying cry , which finds the trio urging the listener to action .
It also explores the altered prospects of adulthood .
`` 22 is like the worst idea that I have ever had , '' Hayley Williams sings .
The vocalist was born on December 27 , 1988 , so was living through that realization of being now a grown-up when she wrote this tune .
