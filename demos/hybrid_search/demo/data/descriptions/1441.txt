This prog-rock influenced track sticks up for an old man in a nursing home , chided for reminiscing on a failed love affair .
Said frontman Guy Garvey to The Sun : `` It bugs me that old people are patronized .
And the lyrics to that song see the old man recounting the end of this affair while being patronized .
` Oh here we go again . '
I liked the idea about the last encounter of a love affair , where the bitterness has gone and the birds are the only things that witnessed it in the line .
` The birds are the keepers of our secrets . '
It 's quite a dark song . ''
Garvey expanded on the song in an interview with The Observer : `` My favourite songs pick on things I 've not heard written about before , '' he said .
`` In that song the character , who I guess is me as an old man , is looking back on that love affair .
The middle eight became the voices of his carers , quite doomy voices saying : ` What we going to do with you , come on inside , looking back is for the birds . '
Patronising him almost : ` Come on , always the same with you ' , the way that old people are spoken to generally .
I suppose I 'm saying it 's wrong to patronise old people and assume they have n't felt everything that you 've felt and remember it very clearly . ''
