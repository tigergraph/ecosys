My Chemical Romance had some rough patches in their first 3 years .
To start , Gerard and Mikey Way 's grandmother died .
Then Gerard went from being a raging drug addict to a sober man , which took a bunch of effort .
Gerard was also pretty suicidal when he was on drugs , so that was a definite problem .
This song looks back on the band 's troubles , but states that because they went through all of this , they 're more hopeful for the future : `` Did you come to stare or wash away the blood ? ''
- They can either live with these problems or clean off the slate and make a new start .
`` We hold in our hearts the sword and the faith '' - The sword is for courage to keep trying for freedom from the pain , and you need faith to be able to wield the sword .
`` From the lights to the pavement From the van to the floor From backstage to the doctor From the earth to the morgue '' - This explains how things would of been if they had given up .
`` Did we fall down ? ''
- They do n't know whether or not they 'd hit bottom or are drifting toward it .
`` Spend the rest of your day 's rockin ' out just for the dead '' - This means that if they had n't of got through it all , they would of just been playing for all the dead ones , seeing as they 'd be with them .
