album , which featured a new synthesizer driven sound .
Frontwoman Karen O told The Sun March 13 , 2009 : `` This is a new era for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs .
This record got our confidence back and was really a move towards enjoying being in a band again .
We started off writing this record with guitars , but gradually the sound developed into what you hear now .
We chose synths because they allow for more space .
They have a quality which is different to Nick -LRB- Zinner 's -RRB- grungy guitar sound .
But , at the same time , Nick 's synth work mimics what he does on the guitar .
So in a way it was a natural progression . ''
This was ranked by both Spin Magazine and the NME as the Best Song of 2009 .
