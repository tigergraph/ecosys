Hawley sings of a man who chooses to live an isolated existence on this allegorical noir-folk ballad .
The song was inspired by a 17th-century Sheffield headstone , which Hawley discovered during a country walk with his dog .
He told The Guardian : `` It 's about George Yardley , a charcoal-burner and solitary man who 's buried there .
It 's tapping into that deep folk tradition , the wood spirits and all that . ''
The song finds Hawley detailing his own funeral .
He told Mojo magazine : `` It 's not like I 'm happy about my own death , but it 's good to make sense of where we go .
So I want trees surrounding my grave , and when they grow I want them chopped down and made into an instrument .
To have your molecules go into a violin or a guitar : I thought , if that 's all death is , then that 's fine .
We 've all got to deal with this s -- t. ''
