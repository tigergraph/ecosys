This track from Devotion 's `` Gold Edition '' was released as its sixth single on April 12 , 2013 .
`` From touring the album , I realized what I wanted to have in the set that I felt was missing , was a more upbeat song , '' Jessie Ware explained to Billboard magazine .
`` I 'm really glad that I wrote one and now I can play it live and it balances -LSB- Devotion -RSB- out . ''
The Kate Moross directed '80s - tinged video sees Ware sending out some disco queen vibes as we see her dancing in a club .
