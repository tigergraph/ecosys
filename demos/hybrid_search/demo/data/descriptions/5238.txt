This song evolved from a riff developed by MCR bass guitarist Mikey Way .
His brother , frontman Gerard Way , explained to Billboard magazine : `` This song started with a riff that Mikey had always been working on and we kind of kept coming back to it .
On ` Summertime , ' whenever there was a moment we would just open the file and we really felt like we could n't have the record without this song . ''
The song is informed by Gerard Way 's relationship with his wife , LynZ of Mindless Self Indulgence , who gave birth to their daughter Bandit in 2009 .
Way said to Billboard magazine : `` It 's one of the lyrically personal songs on the album , whereas the rest of it is just me talking about my world view .
So it 's a really beautiful song and again , no rules .
We can have a soft song .
We can have a new wave song on the album . ''
