This is based on the first book in the bible , Genesis .
The line , `` Walk with me my little child into the forest of denial '' is symbolizing Adam and Eve .
In Genesis , God tells them to eat from any tree except for one tree that is possessed by Satan .
One day they disobey god and eat from the cursed tree and God gets angry because they disobeyed him .
-LRB- thanks , Billy Ross - Hagerstown , MD -RRB- The song is about the ancient Israelites and God .
The song starts out in the Garden Of Eden , then to Moses and 40 years in the desert , and then the last part is about Solomon and his reign .
The Israelites were on the top of the mountain winning battles and being faithful to God .
Then they would turn to Idolatry or some other sin and God would punish them -LRB- valley of the mountain -RRB- .
Then they would realize what they had did and repented .
God would forgive them and they would be back on top .
