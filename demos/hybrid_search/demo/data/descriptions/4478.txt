This lilting song is one of several tracks on Some Nights where frontman Nate Ruess ' lyrics have an instructive element to them .
He told The Village Voice : `` I think there 's a self-help element to the music that , I would n't say I 'm super self-conscious of , but I 've always found music to be very therapeutic for me , specifically , and the lyrics I write .
I feel like a lot of it is just trying to convince myself that everything 's okay .
When you 're singing those words every single night , you kind of start to believe it in some way or another .
The song 's Anthony Mandler directed music video is set in Fun .
's home city of New York and features clips from their sell-out tour , the band drinking and singing in various bars and dancing in an empty Grand Central Station .
`` The idea is for the story to be the truth -- playing a show , hanging out , getting dinner with friends .
It 's more of the reality of what we 're going through these days , '' Ruess said of the clip to MTV News .
`` This video is a harsher look of the realities of what it 's like to be Fun .
-- not in a sad way , but in a very honest way , '' guitarist Jack Antonoff added .
Kieran Kiely , who was once a member of the Irish Folk-Rock band Shane MacGowan and The Popes , performed the Irish drums and whistles on this track .
Fun performed this song at the Grammy Awards in 2013 , with rain falling on the band midway through the performance .
The group won for Best New Artist at the ceremony , where they insisted that they were old .
