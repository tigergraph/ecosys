This is the fourth single from Three Days Grace 's third studio album , Life Starts Now .
It was released for radio airplay on February 1 , 2011 and on March 15th on iTunes .
Life Starts Now found the Canadian rockers playing with different material and this song finds them expressing a warmer sentiment than is typically found in the band 's music .
While electric guitars still play a prominent role , the focus is on Adam Gontier 's voice and a well written melody .
Said drummer Neil Sanderson to Noisecreep : `` We wanted to think outside the box .
Part of that is , as a band , we 're a little bit sick of the sound that a lot of bands go into the studio and default to , like layer upon layer of hard panned guitars that multiply in the chorus .
It just starts to sound really mechanical and over-produced .
So we wanted to make sure that all of the parts were really together , as far as the riffs and the music and everything before we got into the studio .
We really spent a lot of time on those parts because our goal was to make it sound big without having a lot of stuff actually in there . ''
