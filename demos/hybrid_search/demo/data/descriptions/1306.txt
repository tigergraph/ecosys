This song finds Van painting a picture of idolatry as he meditates about the all-encompassing power of money and the ways in which cash has replaced God at the centre of the modern belief system .
Said Morrison : `` That came from looking at a dollar bill and turning the concept on its head .
I thought , ` what is this stuff on here , what does it mean ? '
Some people 's God is money -- we 've discovered that about a lot of people recently .
So then what happens after that ?
What happens if you do n't have it , or if you do n't have enough ? ''
This is one of several tracks on Born To Sing : No Plan B where Morrison references global economic woes .
He explained to Mojo magazine : `` That 's because that stuff is being promoted all the time .
Turn on the radio or TV and they 're going on about money all the time .
There never used to be this obsession with money , it 's very strange .
Well , not strange for them , but strange for me .
I 'm from a working class background and I do n't have this obsession with money , money , money .
I was always taught that all you need is enough , but now there 's this obsession with greed , people want more and more and more .
I do n't know why .
Money 's not gon na save you . ''
