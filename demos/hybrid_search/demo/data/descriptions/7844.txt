This offering to God to let Him take complete control of our lives was inspired by the thought of four bands playing one night and one band `` killing it , '' thereby stealing the show .
When TobyMac 's 5-year-old son heard the demo , he asked his father , `` why would you ask someone to steal the show ? ''
Toby replied : `` Dad 's asking God to take the show and do something bigger than dad can ever do with it .
Dad 's asking God to steal the show . ''
