FKA Twigs ' first single was something that she and New York producer Alejandro Arca came up with at the end of a session .
She recalled to Redbull Music Academy : `` It was n't a particularly successful session up until that point .
We were making these beats and I was whisper-rapping over some stuff , and it all felt a bit empty .
We had half-an-hour left at the end , and we started playing together .
I was on the Tempest , doing some drums .
And Alejandro started adding some synths .
The Tempest has this great function where you can record something straight into it and start manipulating it .
Very quickly the words came to me , out of nowhere .
I 'm not going to lie and say I laboured over it for ages .
I think I wrote it in about seven minutes . ''
`` It 's really emotional , '' Twigs added with a laugh .
`` We were really emotional in the studio on that day , I remember .
Two emo little souls , together .
That 's very unlike us .
Usually in the studio it 's ... it 's ridiculous .
We 'll work for an hour and then put on some Janet Jackson and dance around the room .
Then we 'll put on some merengue tune and tango through the studio .
We work very quickly .
Technically , he 's so fast , which really suits me .
I do n't like to labour over things .
In my experience , the first idea is usually the best one .
And once I start to think about it , it implodes on itself . ''
