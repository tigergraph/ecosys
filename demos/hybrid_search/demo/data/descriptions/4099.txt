On this Delta Blues flavored update of the traditional folk song , Gov ' t Mule blend a Celtic sound with a swampy feel .
Singer , guitarist , and songwriter Warren Haynes told Billboard magazine about it : `` I need to research and find out exactly how old that song is , but I 'm sure it 's over 100 years old .
I learned that song from some folk music friends of mine when I was 14 or 15 , growing up sneaking into these folk clubs in North Carolina .
It 's a traditional Celtic folk song , and I played it for -LRB- producer -RRB- Gordy Johnson one night when we were just sitting around trying to decide what we were going to record and how .
He came up with the idea of giving it a rock 'n roll treatment .
We turned the band loose on it to see what would happen from an arrangement perspective , and everybody came up with all these great ideas .
The next thing you know .
it turned out like it is . ''
