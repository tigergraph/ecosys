Williams told American Songwriter that she wrote this bracing Roots-Rock number `` after the indie rock singer-songwriter Vic Chesnutt took his own life . ''
The song continues a theme that Williams has visited in the past on tracks such as `` Sweet Old World , '' where she ca n't take her mind off of everything a person gives up with suicide .
On the recurrent theme of suicide in her music , Williams said : `` I 'm fascinated with the subject of suicide .
I 've suffered from horrible sadness , melancholia , as a lot of us do , but I ca n't imagine going to that place .
My dad used to describe it as like a deep dark well , and we 're all standing around the edge , and some of us fall in .
`` I think what informs my songwriting is my empathy with that .
Maybe that 's what bothers people .
It scares them to go to the edge of the well and look in .
But it 's what they like also .
And would n't you rather feel the pain than not feel anything ? ''
-LRB- The Telegraph , 2013 -RRB- Williams told the A.V. Club she was actually in the middle of writing this song about a different friend when she got the news of Chesnutt 's suicide .
She continued the story in an interview with Pop Matters : `` I was very emotional about it .
I did n't know Vic very well , but any time you hear about , you know -- he 's one of us , a songwriter and singer and we were mutual admirers of each other 's work . ''
Chesnutt also named a song after her on his 1991 album West of Rome .
