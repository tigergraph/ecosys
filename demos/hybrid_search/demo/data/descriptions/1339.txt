Whilst touring in Spring 2007 , American singer-songwriter Mary Chapin Carpenter experienced severe chest and back pain .
The diagnosis was a pulmonary embolism - blood clots in her lungs .
She was forced to cancel her summer tour to recover , and this song describes the frightening experience .
Carpenter explained to The Boot : `` It 's about the feeling at that moment when I was so ill and I did n't know what was going to happen to me .
I 've never been so terrified in my life .
I felt this burden of all these things - my own life , my place in the world .
I wanted to just float above all of it and to be free .
I wanted to not hurt any more .
So that lyric speaks to being completely helpless . ''
