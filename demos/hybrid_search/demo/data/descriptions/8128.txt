Allen has a solo writing credit for this sweetly sentimental song , which he penned for his wife , Katy , long before he appeared on American idol .
He 's the second `` Idol '' winner to have a sole writing credit on a track from his debut post - `` Idol '' album following in David Cook 's footsteps .
Unsurprisingly , Katy has said this autobiographical ditty is one of her favorite tracks on the album .
The song was inspired by , and written on , a cheap beginner 's guitar Kris bought for Katy , which she never learnt to play .
However , Allen told Entertainment Weekly shortly after laying down the track , that it 's open to interpretation .
`` I know what it means to me , '' he said , `` but it might mean something else to you .
-LSB- Mike Flynn -RSB- and I were working on the track last night .
It was fun to be in the studio and working with a producer who sees your vision for a song you wrote . ''
Allen told Billboard magazine the story of the song : `` I bought a red guitar for my wife for her birthday and she never played it -LSB- laughs -RSB- , so we ended up sticking it on the wall in our house - it was a horrible guitar , just like a $ 50 guitar - but it was a good house decoration .
And one day I picked it up and tuned it and started playing it , and this song just became kind of a metaphor for how I feel about my wife .
It was nice to get that one on the album because it was something from before the Idol stuff and I feel like it 's an amazing song .
It shows who I am as a songwriter and as a musician . ''
