There were a couple of occasions during the writing and recording of Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray where Seether frontman and songwriter Shaun Morgan felt completely demoralized and was ready to throw in the towel .
He explained to Artist Direct that this song was inspired by one of those occasions .
Said Morgan : `` Those lyrics were definitely influenced by the feeling that I was getting like I 'm just a piece of s -- t to these people .
It 's the thought that I 'm nothing but a number and my feelings are never taken into account .
There were a couple of moments where I was having a really hard time .
A lot of honesty came out , and a lot of my innermost thoughts and secrets came out .
It was tough at times , to be honest .
I literally almost quit twice .
If it had n't been for Brendan -LRB- O'Brien , producer -RRB- , I do n't think this album would even be finished . ''
