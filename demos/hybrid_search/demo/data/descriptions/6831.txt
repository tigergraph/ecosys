Ariana Grande 's second single from her debut album , Yours Truly , finds her expressing her special love for someone but admitting that she ca n't formulate her strong feelings into words .
`` Baby I got love for thee , so deep inside of me I do n't know where to start , '' she croons .
The song was released on July 22 , 2013 .
Several reviewers compared Ariana 's vocal performance on the song with another singer who has a large vocal range and a whistle register : Mariah Carey .
The Sam & Cat star told MTV News that her debut album was inspired , in part , by the superstar songstress .
`` You know I love just like old R&B .
I love the '90s , that whole vibe .
I love Mariah Carey , of course , she 's the goddess of all vocals , '' she said .
Ariana told MTV News that she can relate to the song 's lyrical content about getting tongue-tied when you 're with somebody you like .
`` Personally when it comes to me expressing myself with other people , especially if it 's towards the beginning of a crush or the beginning of a relationship , I 'm so awkward and so flustered in that way , '' she said .
`` I 'm always so nervous to express myself that I feel like it 's a very me song in that way . ''
The song was written and produced by Kenneth `` Babyface '' Edmonds -LRB- who is best known for his contribution to the creation of New Jack Swing in the late 1980s -RRB- , Antonio Dixon , and Patrick `` J. Que '' Smith .
The trio also penned together Beyonc√© 's hit single , `` Best Thing I Never Had . ''
The song has a strong nostalgia vibe to it .
Ariana told MTV News : `` I love that .
It felt like '90s , Aaliyah , Destiny 's Child .
I like that it has that throwback feeling to it .
And that 's when I grew up and it was such a feel-good song to me . ''
`` And I love what it says , '' she continued .
`` I love it 's about loving somebody so much that you just do n't know what to say .
I think that 's really cute .
I laughed the first time I heard the lyrics .
I like that I get to sing a little more on it ... It 's quirky . ''
The song 's 1990s throwback video was filmed July 28-29 , 2013 .
`` When I said ' I want it to look like this , ' I said like a TLC , Fresh Prince type vibe , '' Grande told Billboard magazine .
`` I was like , ` Let 's just get really silly , 90 's amazing outfits , and just go out and dance around and have fun . ''
