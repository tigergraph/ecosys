In Barry Toberman 's biography of Elton , it is claimed that he prompted Bernie into writing `` Grimsby '' because Randy Newman had written a song about Cleveland .
There was some suggestion they could make it sound like The Beach Boys .
Grimsby is an unprepossessing fishing port on the Lincolnshire coast , so this was probably a private joke .
In His Song : The Musical Journey of Elton John , Elizabeth Rosenthal writes : `` The joke has probably been lost on many non-British listeners '' who may have taken it literally .
Taupin was born on a farm near Sleaford , which is about fifty miles from Grimsby .
