Palma Violets are a back-to-basics indie rock quartet from South London comprising vocalist and guitarist Sam Fryer , bassist Chilli Jesson , keyboardist Pete Mayhew and drummer Will Doyle .
A series of frantic gigs in their locality generated much hype amongst certain sections of the music press and they were soon snapped up by the Rough Trade label .
This is their debut single , which was released on October 22 , 2012 .
Jesson admitted to NME : `` We did n't even want it to be the first single because it was so under rehearsed , but Rough Trade liked the fact anything could go wrong at any point . ''
Jesson told The Sun about this song : `` It 's like ` Walk On By ' or ` Just My Imagination ' by The Temptations to me .
It 's concerned with growing up and not getting what you want . ''
Sam Fryer added : `` As soon as we start it , I feel it welling up inside .
People say it sounds like The Clash , but to me it 's like The Troggs -- dirty , mean rock 'n' roll .
It 's more sixties than anything we 've done . ''
This was named # 1 in NME 's Best Tracks of 2012 .
Jesson said to the magazine in response to hearing the news : `` It 's such a rough , raw song .
We wrote it one day and recorded it the next , so it was all pretty quick .
That song is at its freshest point .
Every note we 're hitting , like , no one really knows what they 're playing .
It 's tongue-in-cheek .
We 're making s -- t up as we go along and I think that 's maybe why people like it . ''
The 180 album cover is a photo taken by Rough Trade co-owner Jeannette Lee .
She told NME : `` The cover of The Who 's Meaty Beaty Big And Bouncy has kids sitting on some steps outside a rundown house .
They looked like a gang out to cause trouble , which seemed like a spot-on idea to me . ''
