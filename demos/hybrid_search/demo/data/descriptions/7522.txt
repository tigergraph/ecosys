This song was written by Toby Keith and his frequent collaborator Bobby Pinson .
Keith wrote about the writing of this steamy love song on the press release for That Do n't Make Me a Bad Guy : `` We were on the back of my bus with the windows open .
I had a show that night and was about 30 minutes from having to take my shower and get ready .
The sun was going down ; it was summertime .
We were writing this , which is a really steamy song .
Really sweaty , wet-sheet-sticking-to-your-skin kind of lyrics .
I always say the best way to have a hit love song is to say bunch of stuff in the song you 'd never really say to a girl .
So I 'm putting all those kinds of lyrics in and Bobby was running the computer typing in the lyrics .
I came out with some big erotic line .
He looked up at the sunset and it was starting to get dark in the bus .
And he said , `` Hey , hoss .
After that one you 're either going to have to turn some lights on in here or you 're gon na have to light a candle . ''
