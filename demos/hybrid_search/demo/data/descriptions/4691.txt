Guitarist Ryan Ross recalled to VH1 : `` We wrote it one night and it was a lot slower and on acoustic guitar .
I wrote some lyrics and showed -LSB- producer -RSB- Rob -LSB- Mathes -RSB- .
He was n't that excited about it and I think that just made me want to make it better .
Then we sped it up and we played it for the band .
Our keyboard player , a guy who tours with us named Eric , sat in on a session with us , and it just got this vibe going .
I think it feels the most like the band at this point .
Me and Brendon -LSB- frontman Brendon Urie -RSB- .
sing back and forth , everyone is doing backup vocals on it - it was definitely the most group sounding .
In the last refrain the ` reinvent love ' thing kind of just summed up the whole process . ''
