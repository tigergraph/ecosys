Chautauqua County is located in Upstate New York .
It was where Lemuria 's drummer/songwriter Alex Kerns was born .
Kerns told us that many fans are baffled by the song , as it 's not a location that shows up in many works of art .
`` If you look at Chautauqua County on a map , you wo n't recognize any of the cities , '' Kerns said .
`` It 's New York , but Buffalo 's not there .
My hometown where I was born is there , but it 's just like a random town .
There are counties in Utah that do n't have Salt Lake City in it .
There are a handful of people who are from that county who are , like , ` Why did you write about Chautauqua County ? '
That 's the county where I was born in and the song 's kind of about my early childhood during that time period .
It 's not all that weird , but it 's unique from all the other songs I 've written . ''
