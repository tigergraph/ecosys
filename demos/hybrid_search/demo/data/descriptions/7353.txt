There are several possible interpretations for this song , but it seems to be about two teens who have sex in their car -LRB- `` A teenage vow in a parking lot '' -RRB- , and take the chance to not be protected -LRB- `` Sometimes we take chances , sometimes we take pills '' -RRB- .
The girl gets pregnant , and both are scared what others will think when they find out -LRB- `` To hell with our good name we mix up your guts Your insides x-rayed '' -RRB- .
The boy is not sure whether to leave or not -LRB- `` One foot in your bedroom And one foot out the door '' -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , Aria - Chicago , IL -RRB- Fall Out Boy 's lyrics are written by bass player Pete Wentz , and some of these could relate to his life , as `` I sing the Blues and swallow them too '' could pertain to his overdose on the anxiety drug Atavan in 2005 .
-LRB- thanks , Aaron - Jackson , MS -RRB- The `` Hallelujah '' the singer hums in the song could be the Hallelujah chorus of Handel 's `` Messiah , '' or the song `` Hallelujah , '' which was written by Leonard Cohen .
