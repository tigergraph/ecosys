Vocalist Ricky Wilson -LRB- from The Sun October 17 , 2008 -RRB- : `` We could have had the opening line ` I 'm a bit lonely ' but no one would have picked up on that .
It 's all about visualizing things .
People say , ` What 's it about ? '
And I go , ` What do you think ? '
They always say , ` Someone being lonely ' .
Why ask the question ? ''
Rix commented to Drowned in Sound : `` There 's a lot more imagery on this album than the last one .
Particularly in this song .
It 's meant to be a laid back Beach Boys kind of song and features some old fashioned style backing vocals from Nick that you do n't really hear much any more . ''
Kaiser Chief bassist Simon Rix explained the song 's unusual title to Drowned in Sound : `` This song has a title that everyone seems to be intrigued by .
We had written most of the music for this song in Old Chapel -LRB- a rehearsal room in Leeds -RRB- and then the title just came out of nowhere .
When we are playing in the room , Rick and Nick -LRB- Hodgson , drums -RRB- often just sing things over the top until they come up with something good .
Sometimes the best lyrics just come into your head .
So one of them will be singing something and then one of them will say ; ` did you say ` Tomato In The Rain ' ? '
The idea will then develop from there .
I think in this case Nick came up with the title then Ricky went away and wrote the rest of the words . ''
On this track , the band 's keyboardist , Nick ` Peanut ' Baines , played a Farfisa organ , which was put through guitarist Andrew White 's amplifier .
