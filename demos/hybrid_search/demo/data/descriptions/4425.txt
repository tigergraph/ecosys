Thousand Foot Krutch vocalist Trevor McNevan -LRB- from NewReleaseTuesday -RRB- : `` This is another firecracker , more of an adrenaline rock song .
I could n't help but picture NASCAR drivers flying by on the track to this .
I love big , anthemic songs that are calls to action - so this one is case and point . ''
