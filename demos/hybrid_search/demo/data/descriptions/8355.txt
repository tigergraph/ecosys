This vibrant uptempo song with a tender core was inspired by singer Doug Robb 's baby girl , who was born during the writing for Fight or Flight .
`` That is a very literal song , '' he explained .
`` Magnolia is my daughter 's name .
The first line is , ' I watch and wonder as you discover ' - it 's me looking at my child as an infant discovering the world , and hoping that I find something in her that reminds me of myself .
More generally , it 's a father looking at his daughter and realizing how fleeting and precious these moments are . ''
The rhythmic whooshing sound heard at the beginning of the song and repeated in the bridge is an ultrasound recording of Magnolia 's prenatal heartbeat .
`` It was n't altered tempo-wise to fit the song , '' Robb pointed out `` It just fit .
It 's one of the songs I play for Maggie , and the second she hears the guitar in the beginning , she starts dancing .
Maybe it subconsciously reminds her of being in the womb . ''
