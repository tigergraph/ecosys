This Hillary Lindsey , Steven McEwan and Gordie Sampson penned song finds Lauren singing of taking a drive down to Tupelo in Mississippi with the boy she loves .
She told Taste of Country : '' ` Tupelo ' has been one of my favorites since the very beginning .
It has one of the coolest vibes to it .
It 's not like any other Country song out there .
It has a summertime feel to it -- like the wind is blowing or you 're lying in a hammock .
It 's about taking a trip with this boy that you are in love with , and having fun with him as he does things like picking a wildflower and putting it in your hair .
It 's a cute story about a boy and a girl taking a trip just to spend time together , driving around and doing nothing . ''
Tupelo is best known as the birthplace of Elvis Presley .
Other songs that namecheck the Mississippi city include John Lee Hooker 's `` Tupelo Blues , '' which chronicles a flood there and Bobby Gentry 's `` Ode to Billy Joe , '' where the brother of the tragic titular character buys a store in Tupelo .
Van Morrison also has a song called `` Tupelo Honey . ''
