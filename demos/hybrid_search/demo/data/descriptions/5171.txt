This song is a swipe at The Stones ' home country of England .
They imply that the people are lazy and the politicians incompetent .
The Stones rarely performed in England because of the huge taxes that were levied on entertainers .
It was much more profitable for them to live and work elsewhere .
This was released as a single in America but not England .
The Stones first recorded the track in 1978 at the Some Girls sessions .
Lyrics were added and it was repackaged for Tattoo You .
The original title was `` Lazy Bitch , '' probably referring to British prime minister Margaret Thatcher .
