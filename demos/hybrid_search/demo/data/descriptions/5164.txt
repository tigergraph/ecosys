This song features Icelandic unknown vocalist Hafdis .
Tricky explained on his record label 's website : `` The song 's inspired by Scorcese 's The Last Temptation Of Christ and I just thought her voice would be great because its kinda innocent .
I thought she 'd be good at playing Jesus .
Not everybody could get away with that . ''
