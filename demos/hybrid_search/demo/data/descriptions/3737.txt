This track which runs to nearly 7 and a half minutes is as good as Deep Purple Mark III ever got .
A Blackmore/Coverdale composition , it appears that Ritchie wrote the music some years before , but it never found its way onto the Machine Head album which featured lead vocalist Ian Gillan in the Mark II line up .
Like the rest of the Burn album , the 7th track was recorded at Montreaux , Switzerland in November 1973 .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 3 -RRB- Although it has some fine guitar work -LRB- what else would one expect from Ritchie Blackmore ? -RRB-
`` Mistreated '' shows David Coverdale at his rawest and most powerful , and it is just a shame that he chose to develop his undoubted talents in another direction - downwards .
