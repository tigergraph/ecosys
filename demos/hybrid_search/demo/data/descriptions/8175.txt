This is a song from Basic Instinct , the fourth studio album by Atlanta based R&B singer Ciara .
The song features American R&B and pop singer The-Dream , who also co-penned the track along with his songwriting partner Christopher `` Tricky '' Stewart .
Ciara relocated to the West Coast to work on Basic Instinct with Tricky and Dream , who previously collaborated with the Atlantan on two tracks from 2008 's Fantasy Ride , `` High Price '' and `` Like a Surgeon . ''
The-Dream was a major contributor to Basic Instinct .
Ciara discussed with The Boombox how the R&B hitmaker 's input gave her a renewed vision for making music : `` The beauty of music is that it allows you to express yourself and paint a picture .
I 've really approached things differently than I did with a lot of my records .
I let Dream also be a part of laying my foundation and I 'm not afraid to say that because anybody will tell you that the way that I 've written my records over the years is definitely different than the way that I 've approached these records .
I wanted fresh energy and having Tricky and Dream , and Dream in particular , allowed some of the lyrics to be a little bit different than in my past .
So he may make a story from something that I 'm going through , -LSB- some of the music -RSB- was definitely -LSB- from -RSB- some personal experiences , some things that happen around me ... things that inspire me .
I get inspired from many different places .
It just depends on the day . ''
