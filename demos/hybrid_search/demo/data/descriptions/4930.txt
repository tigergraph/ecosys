U2 wrote this for the soundtrack of the Wim Wenders movie of the same name .
In the movie , angels come to earth and assume human form .
Bono 's duet with Frank Sinatra , `` I 've got you under my skin , '' is the B-side of the single .
In 2002 , Bono recorded a new version of this with Scottish composer Craig Armstrong .
It is on Armstrong 's album As If To Nothing .
In 2000 , Bono teamed up with Wenders to write the movie The Million Dollar Hotel .
Wenders directed the film , which stars Mel Gibson and Milla Jovovich .
On the 2001 Elevation tour , while The Edge played the acoustic intro , Bono would say `` This is from the period where we got art-y , we went to Berlin , and started out on two extraordinary albums by our point of view -LRB- Achtung Baby and Zooropa -RRB- .
Then we thought we were genius .
Pop we just floated out there . .
this song was kind of a diary of the float . .
you find some extraordinary things while you are out there . ''
