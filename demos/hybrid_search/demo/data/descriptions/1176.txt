This is a track from You Get What You Give , the second major-label studio album by the Zac Brown Band .
The album 's title comes from a line in the song .
In a `` hue-morous '' coincidence , the week You Get What You Give debuted at # 1 on the Billboard 200 , directly below the Zac Brown Band at # 2 were the also monikered-with-a-color act Maroon 5 with their Hands All Over set .
You Get What You Give debuted at # 1 on the US Billboard 200 dated October 9 , 2010 , giving the Zac Brown Band their first ever chart-topping album .
It was also the first instance of two different Country groups recording # 1 albums in a calendar year , Lady Antebellum having topped the charts previously in 2010 with their Need You Now record .
The song features a guest appearance from bluegrass guitarist Tony Rice .
Guitarist Clay Cook told The River Front Times his contribution was , `` a perfect fit .
It was one of those things where we did n't know if it was going to work , because he 's a traditional bluegrass player , but the tape rolled and he was perfect .
And it totally makes the song ; I mean , you take him out of the song and it 's just kinda flat . ''
