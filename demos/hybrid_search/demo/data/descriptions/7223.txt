This was the second single taken from British rock band Roxy Music 's seventh studio album , Flesh + Blood .
Singer Bryan Ferry explained to The Mail on Sunday June 28 , 2009 : `` In this song I was trying to create a picture of Americana , and long hot summer evenings at drive-in movies .
It is wistful and nostalgic , rather like a country record . ''
