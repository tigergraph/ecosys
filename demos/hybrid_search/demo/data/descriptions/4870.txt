This emotion-packed tune finds Scott pleading with God to heal her broken heart following her break-up with John , who is the father of her son Jett .
She told UK newspaper The Sun : `` It 's supposed to hurt when you hear it .
At that point I had stopped believing in love .
That was a very strange place for me to be .
I 've always believed in love .
I 've always enjoyed it .
I 've always loved to see it .
I 've been a fan my whole life .
I thought I was dying .
I do n't know how many times I 've been close to death but this was a time I was very aware of it .
I 'd never been so sad in my life and I wrote ` Hear My Call ' at that time . ''
