Black Country Communion frontman Glenn Hughes found himself battling drug addiction at the height of his professional success in the mid - '80s when he was the lead vocalist for Black Sabbath as well as playing bass and performing vocals for some of the later Deep Purple lineups .
He penned this bluesy song about those difficult times for BCC guitarist Joe Bonamassa to sing , but he ended up performing the vocals himself .
Hughes explained to Musicradar.com : `` The first really slow song I 've ever written , and I wrote it for Joseph to sing . '
I want you to write a song about a little secret , ' he told me , and I wrote about my relapses with drugs and a lot of painful stuff .
We 're talking about a very intense period .
Let 's just say that I went from this really euphoric time -- when I experimented a bit ... or a lot , shall we say -- but I wanted Joe to sing about it .
When I went in to do a rough vocal just to show Joe the song , he was blown away and said , ` No way , man .
This is your song . '
He was talking about the lyrics , on one hand , but he also had something else in mind .
` Everybody knows I 'm a blues singer , ' he said , ` but this is your chance to sing a blues track .
Go for it . '
I love performing it .
It 's a very honest song .
In fact , it might be my favorite on the whole album .
Like the title says , it 's about secrets , and I 'm a man who does n't want to have any secrets from anybody anymore .
The weight 's too much .
I need emotional freedom . ''
