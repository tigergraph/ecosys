Springsteen wrote this for Donna Summer , but decided to keep it for himself after recording the demo .
A fan of Donna Summer , Springsteen gave her a song called `` Protection '' instead of this .
This was recorded at The Hit Factory in New York City , where artists like Stevie Wonder , John Lennon and Paul Simon liked to record .
The studios catered to the needs of the musicians and the staff would go out of their way to make sure they were comfortable .
The Hit Factory finally closed in 2005 .
This was the second of 7 Top-10 US singles on Born In The U.S.A. Springsteen was not known for hit singles , but this album was wildly successful .
After this album , he made music that did n't do so well on the charts but was important to him and many of his fans .
