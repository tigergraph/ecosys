This is a track by British R&B singer Jay Sean , from his compilation album , Hit The Lights .
American producer and rapper Timbaland helmed the uptempo cut .
The song finds Sean channelling the Hip-Hop side of his musical background .
`` That 's a complete swagger record , '' said the singer .
`` I 've never done anything like that before .
A lot of the intricate flows come from my Hip-Hop background when I used to write raps . ''
Sean told DesiHits why this song differs from anything else he has done .
`` That 's me singing in a whole different style , a different voice , using my voice as an instrument to try and find out different ways of using it .
Its interesting and song writing - wise its very different too . ''
