This was the third track to be unveiled from Little Boots , aka Victoria Hesketh 's , sophomore album .
Asked by NME what motivated the song she replied : `` It was inspired by the idea of wanting to go out with your friends but not enjoying the music being played , so sneaking your own headphones into a club so you can dance to the music you want to , kind of the ultimate silent disco soundtrack ! ''
The song 's music video sees people in a booth wearing headphones .
Hesketh explained its concept to NME : `` The inspiration for the video was partly from the Wim Wenders film Paris Texas and the idea of a peep show revolving around headphones and listening to music as opposed to talking.The idea is that everyday characters enter a booth and on listening to the song their extrovert selves appear in the reflection , so the song is a way of releasing their inner selves and setting the crazier side of them free .
`` Hesketh added : `` We wanted to create an energetic party atmosphere to fit the song whilst avoiding the clich√©s of a lot of current club themed videos . ''
