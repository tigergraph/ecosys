The band 's songwriter Pete Shelley told Artist Direct that the song was inspired by a television program he happened to be watching : Said Shelley : `` I had written the tune , but I had n't got any words , and I was watching a business channel and they were talking about credit , people being in debt , really .
And so the word credit was under tuned in my head .
And I got this idea of credit , then added the idea of people buying stuff they do n't want and the ` video phones with all the latest ring tones . ' ''
