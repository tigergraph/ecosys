When asked about his rapping on singersroom.com , Trey Songz replied : `` If I 'm going to do it then it 's not going to be something that 's thought about .
It 's going to have to come naturally .
Like ` Wonder Woman , ' I did n't say man I 'm a rap on this track .
I just went in and rapped on it .
If I 'm rapping on some songs on the album then it felt good and I was like I 'm gon na rap on these songs .
Rapping is something I take seriously .
I love it .
It was my first love ; I started rapping before singing .
If I ever go that route , it wo n't be wack . ''
