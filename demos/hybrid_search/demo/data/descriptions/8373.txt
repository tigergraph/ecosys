This song is about how someone creates a fantasy of their own life before realizing that it 's all rubbish .
Tunstall penned the song before she ended her four-year marriage to drummer Luke Bullen , who was also the drummer in her band , and its musical director .
However , the lyrics reflect the sense of foreboding she felt .
`` I wrote that before things happened , '' she told The Daily Mail .
`` But that was my life .
All the boxes ticked but I was n't happy .
Clearly , in my subconscious I understood what was going on . ''
Tunstall explained the song 's meaning to The Daily Telegraph : `` This song is the title track of the first half of the record , and sets the scene .
It 's about creating a reality that is only based on what you want to see , not what 's real .
It 'll either come crashing down , or you 'll want to set it alight yourself to find the truth . ''
`` It 's about the idea that if you try and control life , you kill it , '' she continued , `` but if you let it flow in its own way , it can flourish . ''
