Frontman Brett Anderson underscores Bloodsport 's love-as-violence title as he sings , `` I smile as the rope cuts through me . ''
He told NME about this glimpse of a sordid relationship : `` Sabotage is n't a real rocker but it 's not that mellow either - it 's mid tempo .
It 's quite '80s indie in its darkness , akin to The Cure or Joy Division and that kind of stuff , quite slow and very atmospheric . ''
Anderson explained the album title to The Sun : `` In a way , it is a concept album , '' he said .
I was writing and realised that every song was about a different stage within a relationship .
Co-dependency , suspicion , obsession - it 's almost like a journey through the arc of a relationship .
`` I wanted my lyrics to have that sexual tension and ambiguity that classic Suede had without it being self-referential , '' he added .
`` And the title Bloodsports summed up the carnal chase of love - the word carnal meaning meat . ''
