Jewel discussed this song on her website : `` This is an older song and falls in my Pieces of You category .
It 's my little brand of folksy , country hard-to-define genre .
It has whimsical lyrics , and has a shuffle similar to ` You Were Meant For Me . '
For those hardcores who know this song from bootlegs - it is different .
I changed it from waltz time to 4/4 , I created a chorus hook by changing chords , and I wrote a sweet bridge -LRB- I borrowed some lyric theme from the song I wrote with Joe Firstman , for those keeping track of how I cannibalize my own material -RRB- I added steel drum to this song , as it has a breezy quality that works perfectly with an island drum .
