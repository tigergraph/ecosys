The lead single from the Rock band P.O.D. 's eighth album Murdered Love , this song is a meditation on heaven .
In our interview with lead singer Sonny Sandoval , who wrote the lyrics , he explained , `` It 's definitely more of a thought on the afterlife .
Sometimes I find myself thinking about it a lot , because here we are .
The meaning of life , the question , heaven and hell , everybody 's wondering what 's going to happen after we die .
And being of faith , I have a peace of where I 'll spend eternity , but at the same time , I have a heart and a burden for people that do n't know and do n't understand .
So if I believe that heaven and hell exists , then well , wait for me , because I believe I 'm going to go there .
But what about the people that are lost and maybe are n't ?
My heart breaks for them .
So that 's just a thought of sometimes it 's a peaceful thought , and sometimes it 's a very scary thought . ''
The video was directed by Spence Nicholson , who has also done clips for Augustana , Hollywood Undead , and Angels Fall .
Shortly after it hit YouTube , the video accumulated over a million views .
In the clip , an astronaut is haunted by memories as he walks on a barren planet .
In our interview with Nicholson , he explained : `` To me , ` Lost in Forever ' was a very powerful track .
There are many beliefs about what may come after life -LRB- and I wo n't get into mine here -RRB- , so I felt like going with something specifically vague that could serve as a proxy to many people 's beliefs would best serve the track .
I 'm glad you saw the '60s sci-fi vibe in there .
I 've always been a fan of shows like The Twilight Zone , The Outer Limits and Alfred Hitchcock Presents , shows that had big ideas wrapped in small packages . ''
