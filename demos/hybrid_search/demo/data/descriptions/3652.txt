This is the title track of the British Alternative Rock band Young Guns ' second album .
Frontman Gustav Wood told the story of the song to Kerrang !
`` We borrowed our producer Dan Weller 's studio to get ourselves out of our practice room that we 've written in for years .
Dan said , ` Borrow the studio , get some work done , and please do n't have any parties ... ' Obviously we proceeded to have loads of parties and get absolutely nothing done for two weeks !
On the last day we were really hungover , and the boys were sitting in the room with their instruments .
Ben -LRB- Joliffe , drums -RRB- was messing around with a simple Queen-esque ` We Will Rock You ' type tom beat .
Out of nowhere , Fraser -LRB- Taylor , guitar -RRB- came up with the lead riff that ` Bones ' uses .
I ran into the room and was like , ` There 's something about that !
Keep doing it !
When we got to the chorus part I just opened my mouth and ' I feel it in my bones ' came out '' We just looked at each other and were like , ` F -- k !
That 's cool !
Keep going !
I knew right then that we 'd written something special .
`` Wood added that his improvised hook was a reaction to hearing the song itself : `` We were really buzzing off it , '' he said , `` so I just sang something that felt right in the heat of the moment and that chorus just came out !
It instantly felt very familiar , we knew it was gold . ''
This was chosen by Kerrang !
magazine as their Best Song of 2012 .
