Paul Weller told Mojo magazine June 2008 about this spoken word piece : `` It was -LRB- guitarist , Steve -RRB- Craddock suggested we had a spoken-word piece .
I 'd had a poem knocking around for two or three years .
I showed it to him and he liked it .
It 's Aziz Ibrahim -LRB- one-time Stone Roses guitarist -RRB- reading it - he also put some Punjabi at the end .
He 's a Muslim but agrees with the words . ''
This track suggests to some that The Modfather has found religion .
Weller told The Sun : `` I do n't know about finding God .
God finds you , I think .
I do n't have any belief in any organized religion .
I find that all very divisive .
I would n't knock any organized religion .
If it gives people faith and strength it 's a good thing .
But if it divides people it 's the antithesis of what it 's supposed to be about . ''
Weller added in an interview with told The Sun newspaper : `` I 've had the poem for ages .
I 've not been able to use it even though I liked the sentiment in it .
Then Steve Cradock was saying we really needed a poem on this album .
Aziz just came down on a social visit and we got him to do it .
It 's an interesting one because he 's a very devout Muslim man - it 's an interesting twist . ''
Weller discussed his religious beliefs further during an interview with The Observer March 11 , 2012 , telling the newspaper that he believes in God , `` but not in a Christian way . ''
He added that he believes , `` Some kind of force , energy , '' has mapped out his life .
`` You do n't always choose the life you have , do you ?
, '' he concluded .
