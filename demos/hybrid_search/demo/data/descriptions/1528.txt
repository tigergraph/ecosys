This song is about a man 's lover , who he ca n't marry because she has died .
He lives a life of crime , killing people , doing the same things every day and also killing every day .
A closer look at some of the lyrics : `` A thousand bodies piled up , I never thought would be enough to show you just what I 've been thinking . ''
- In order to be with his lover , he must kill 1000 people to prove that he loves her and to get out of purgatory and be with her .
`` These hands , stained red , from the times I have killed you and then , we can wash down this engagement ring with poison and kerosene '' - He has killed so many people and he is ashamed .
He thinks that the blood will never wash from his hands , and he knows he will never be able to marry his lover so he wants to kill himself .
`` We 'll laugh , as we die , and we 'll celebrate the end of things with cheap champagne '' - Once he has collected the 1000 corpses to escape purgatory , he can join his lover again , and they can laugh and celebrate together .
