Frontman Corey Taylor told Kerrang !
that this song is in the same vein to the previous track on the album , `` Dying . ''
He explained : `` It 's the point where you say , ` Can we just level with each other ?
Can we figure this out , please ?
Just talk to me .
I do n't care what the hell you say to me , just be honest with me . ' ''
Taylor expanded on this song to Artist Direct : `` It 's one of those songs where you 're basically saying to someone , ` Let 's cut the s -- t. Can we just cut through the bulls -- t for ten seconds and level with each other ?
Give me what I need , so I can give you what you need .
We can be better people for it . '
That song especially is such zero bulls -- t. It 's like , ` Can we just f -- king move on ?
Are we going to live in this forever ?
Can we get away from this negative energy and be alive for a little bit ? ''
