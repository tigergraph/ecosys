This song is about being in a relationship and coming to realize the other person involved does n't have closure from their previous engagement/relationship .
The lyrics , `` My 2 cents says you remember the way your Ex smells '' and `` It 's on the bed , on the sheets right where I forgot it '' hint at him having thoughts in his head of them sleeping together ... even on the same bed and sheets he lays with her on .
He is fighting within himself as of whether to up and leave or stay involved with this girl .
A beautiful song about feeling second place in someone 's heart when you should be # 1 .
