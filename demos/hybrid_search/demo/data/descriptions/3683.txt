Lumineers lead vocalist and guitarist Wesley Schultz recalls his early days as a musician on this song , when he moved from Ramsey , New Jersey to Brooklyn , hoping to make the big time .
However , the glamorous bohemian lifestyle and the rewarding gigs did n't happen .
`` New York , it lied to me , I needed the truth , '' he sings .
`` The cost of living is so high , '' Schultz explained to American Songwriter magazine .
`` I became so disenchanted -- there 's this myth that New York is the place to be to express and build yourself as an artist .
And it may be for some people .
But it was n't for me . ''
