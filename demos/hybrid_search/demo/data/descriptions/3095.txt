This song draws on reggae-inspired genres like dancehall and dub to illustrate an eccentric young woman .
`` I love the picture of what this girl is like because I do believe , much like the narrator believes , that there is a person for every person , '' Kirsten Bush told CMT News .
`` There might even be more than one , but I do believe in it .
I 'm a hopeless and helpless romantic .
When that song started to unfold , we got to the bridge of it , and I was referencing dancehall , like hyip-dibi-dibi-dibi , hyip-dibi-dibi-dibi . ''
Jennifer Nettles told CMT News that she embraced the chance to write lyrics based on the dub rhythm of the actual words .
`` The lyrics themselves can just be fun words that sound really ` riki-tiki ' to say , '' she noted .
`` It does n't have to always have to make narrative sense but just have fun with having fun words .
If you remember the Sugar Hill Gang -LSB- a pioneering hip hop group in the '70s check out Rapper 's Delight -RSB- , when everybody wanted to learn ` hip-hop-hippa-to-the-hippity-hip-hop . '
Everybody wants to learn that .
It 's fun to say . ''
