Rock explained to Billboard magazine how this roadhouse shuffle was inspired by a Rolling Stones inspired jam : `` That one 's a blast to play .
It had more of a ` Tumblin ' Dice ' feel to it and -LSB- drummer -RSB- Chad Smith just started bangin ' out this shuffle beat and everyone started getting their lick on here and there and I started singing it , and Rick -LSB- Rubin , producer -RSB- was like , ` hold on , stop , let 's record . '
It was just fun , we were just having a ball .
Kind of like Mick Jagger 's writing , what the hell 's he talking about ?
I do n't know , but it just sounds fun . ''
