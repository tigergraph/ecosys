On September 12 , 2003 , the legendary singer Johnny Cash died at the age of 71 , just a few months after the death of his wife , June Carter Cash .
That same day , another singer , Shelby Lynne , wrote a tribute to the couple called `` Johnny Met June . ''
It 's not a song about how the couple first met , but about how they were reunited in heaven : Now we 're starting over it 's the place that we areYou look more than pretty underneath all the starsLove , love is a burning thingOh how I still love to hear you singAnd everything we ever heard about heaven is trueToday 's the day that Johnny met June `` Johnny Met June , '' is featured on Lynne 's 2005 album , Suit Yourself , the same year she made her acting debut as Cash 's mother , Carrie , in the biopic Walk the Line .
Needless to say , Lynne is a fan of the Man in Black .
`` I was a fan all my life not just of the music but of Johnny Cash as a figure who stood very strong , '' she says .
`` He 's someone who had his troubles in his life but he was always inspirational . ''
