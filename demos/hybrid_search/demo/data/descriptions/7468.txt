During the recording of An End Has A Start , frontman Tom Smith lost a much-loved grandparent and heard that a buddy of his had been murdered in a homophobic attack .
He responded by penning this song .
He told the Mail on February 10 , 2008 : `` It shocked me how senseless death can be .
I did n't want to go out after that .
What 's the point when there are people like that around ?
But the record is n't just about death and I 'm not angst-ridden the whole time . ''
