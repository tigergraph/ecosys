This track from Long Island rockers Taking Back Sunday self-titled fifth studio album finds vocalist Adam Lazzara singing in the chorus , `` This is all I ever ask from you / The only thing you could n't do / Tell me the whole truth . ''
`` The lyrics went through three or four different drafts , just to get everything straight and make sure that we were getting our idea across , '' he told Spin magazine .
`` There 's a couple lines in that song that are definitely a little uncomfortable to sing . ''
Taking Back Sunday marked the return of original members John Nolan -LRB- guitarist -RRB- and Shaun Cooper -LRB- bass player -RRB- after they exited the group in 2003 and some fans have interpreted the lyrics as a sign that all is not well between Lazzara and Nolan .
However , the singer explained they are n't aimed at his colleague .
He told Spin : `` It 's not so much our relationship as it 's about our relationship with faith and growing up in and out of the church and everything like that .
Seeing that some of those lines are so harsh , it was good to get that out and it makes for a really personal tune for the both of us . ''
