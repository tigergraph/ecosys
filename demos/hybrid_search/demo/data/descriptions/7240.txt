Lamar lays boastful rhymes over Hit-Boy 's menacing soundscape .
`` It 's about me and my homeboys really getting in the backseat and starting our day , '' Lamar explained to Complex magazine .
`` Sometimes we 'll rap , it takes away from everything else .
That 's one of the feelings that the record produces . ''
The song 's black and white video was directed by Lamar with Dave Free and JeremeD .
The clip is set in both Compton and Paris and introduces K-Dot 's dad whom we see smoking some weed while getting on his son 's case over his misplaced domino set .
We also see his mom teasing her husband about his hat .
The rear-shaking girl is meant to be Sherane , the young seductress whom Lamar raps about on `` Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter 's Daughter '' and `` Poetic Justice . ''
She is played by a model who bears a strong resemblance to K-Dot 's teenage crush .
