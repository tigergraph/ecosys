This is the second single by English pop rock band McFly , from their fifth album , Above the Noise .
The group penned the song with chart-topping singer and producer Taio Cruz .
Despite only reaching # 4 , this became McFly 's longest-running hit to date and their first song to spend over 9 Weeks in the UK Top 30 .
The group 's chart trajectory is traditionally a high entry -LRB- often at # 1 -RRB- , then a swift descent and prior to `` Shine a Light , '' they had never previously spent more than eight weeks in the Top 30 .
At the exclusive launch for Above the Noise , McFly described the process of the creating the song `` like working backwards . ''
Rather than working from a piano before adding all the additional instrumentation , they built up the song from beats , bass lines and drum sounds .
