Maxwell described this to MTV News as `` a bittersweet love song about meeting the right girl at the wrong time . ''
Black was the first album of Maxwell 's BLACKsummer ` snight trilogy .
He explained to MTV News : `` Three sides of my crazy personality .
Black is dark .
Summer 's is the lighter side .
That album is more of a gospel side - not in the traditional sense , but more like Deepak Chopra meets that minister or that pastor down in the South somewhere .
The Night album is the ultimate love record . ''
Maxwell told Billboard magazine : `` I met this girl who I still respect very much , and although it did n't work out , I got lots of inspiration from it .
This track speaks of my time with her . ''
This was Maxwell 's first single release since his 2002 cover of Kate Bush 's `` This Woman 's Work . ''
This was Maxwell 's third # 1 on the Adult R&B airplay chart .
The song took eight weeks to fly to the top position , the chart 's fastest since Anita Baker 's `` You 're My Everything '' reached the summit in its fifth week in 2004 .
This was Maxwell 's first # 1 on R&B / Hip-Hop Songs , since he topped the chart for eight weeks with `` Fortunate '' in 1998 .
His spell between # 1s set a record for the longest gap between chart-toppers since the R&B / Hip-Hop Songs chart began using Nielsen SoundScan data in December 1992 .
The late Aaliyah held the previous record for the longest gap between R&B / Hip-Hop # 1s .
She took seven years between `` If Your Girl Only Knew '' in 1996 and her posthumous 2003 chart-topper `` Miss You . ''
