This Christopher Bridges and Adonis Shropshire penned ballad is the title track of R&B singer Monica 's sixth studio album .
The track features guest vocals by her cousin-by-marriage - the rapper Ludacris .
This song was originally earmarked as the album 's lead single , with its production and release being tracked by an episode of her reality show .
However , as Monica and the label were not in agreement with this becoming the first single , `` Everything To Me '' was released instead .
The song serves as the theme song for her BET reality show Monica : Still Standing , which made the second highest series debut in BET history .
