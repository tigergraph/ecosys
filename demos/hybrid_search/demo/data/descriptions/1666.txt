Singer Justin Pierre explained the song 's meaning : `` The song is about procrastination and sort of the idea of ` Yeah , I 'm gon na do it .
I 'm totally gon na do it .
I 'm just going to sit here and take a nap and think of all the things I 'm actually going to do one day but never actually do , ' '' he said .
`` The Coma Kid , somebody who 's just unable to actually do .
Someone who 's thinking of doing but not actually doing . ''
