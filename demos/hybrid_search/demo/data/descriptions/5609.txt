This is a track from Utah based Indie Rock band Neon Trees debut album , Habits .
Singer Tyler Glenn explained the story behind this song to Artist Direct : `` It 's basically about my younger siblings and seeing my little sister go through high school .
Once you 're past high school age and you 're on the other side , you see how petty and small the drama in high school is .
I based the lyrics on those funny experience of noticing how small and narrow that age thinks .
They think their lives are over if something happens or someone is talking about them or there 's a rumor .
They do n't realize that there 's so much more ahead of them , and it 's such a small part of life .
Basically , the song is about that .
It 's a commentary on youth in general . ''
