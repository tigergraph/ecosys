Imani Coppola explained this song to Digital Spy : `` You know , I go the gym and I watch TV for an hour and it 's always like four or five people : Paris Hilton , Nicole Richie , Britney Spears , Lindsay Lohan and maybe one other .
That song 's just a sarcastic little ` f -- k you ! '
I thought , ` I 'm going to show you guys what you 're doing but I 'm going to be black doing it ' .
It 's me living out their little puny fantasy of being famous for no reason : getting drunk , having an accident , flashing your p -- sy , going to jail , finding God , getting pregnant , having a baby and then the world loves you again 'cause you 're a nice mom !
It 's so f -- king annoying !
Do you guys have anyone like that ? ''
