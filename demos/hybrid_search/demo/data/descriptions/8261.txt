This demure lullaby with melancholic piano chords is an ode to love and misery .
Vocalist and chief songwriter Britt Daniel admitted to The Guardian February 18 , 2010 that he feels things intensely , which seems to be where the spark to write songs comes from : `` I 'm lucky enough to be able to pull that stuff out of me . ''
He added : `` As a band , I feel we 're great .
But there are a lot of personal demons that do n't have anything to do with the success .
Right now I 'd actually like to be in somebody else 's band .
To get my mind clear . ''
