Courtney Love co-wrote this song with Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins , then later fell out with him .
When the track listing for Nobody 's Daughter became available , Corgan lashed out at the Hole singer on Twitter for allegedly including this song and others on the album without permission .
The Smashing Pumpkins frontman tweeted : `` My face is my face , my heart is my heart , my money is my money .
Oh , and my songs are MY songs .
If you ca n't write your own songs , maybe you should just be happy that you fooled someone into doing your work for you . ''
