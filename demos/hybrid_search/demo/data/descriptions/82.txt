This electrified track features Los Angeles electro-hop group LMFAO .
Jon later returned the favor when he guested on the duo 's single , `` Shots . ''
Crunk Rock moved away from its original crunk and rock mash-up concept to a far more eclectic album that flirts with house music , pop , electro and R&B .
`` I kind of took Crunk Rock to another level , '' Lil Jon told Rolling Stone .
`` It 's not just dealing with crunk music and rock - it 's basically a lifestyle .
Living life to the fullest , getting crazy , getting crunk and just partying ... I 'm just trying to make everybody have fun and make 'em dance again .
Because in rap , people stopped partying .
You go to a hip-hop party and people just stand around trying to look hard and cool .
I want people to wild out and sweat and mosh pit again . ''
