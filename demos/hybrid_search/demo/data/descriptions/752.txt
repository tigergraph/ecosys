Guitarist Jason Hook told Loudwire that he brought this in for the American Capitalist album .
He admitted , `` It pretty much was stuck on the back burner for the whole record , I 'm not sure if anyone else liked it .
I know our producer liked it a lot and it went through many different face lifts before it ended up at ` If I Fall . ' ''
Hook told Loudwire that he loves vocalist Ivan Moody 's lyric for this song .
He said : `` Ivan takes something that 's potentially pretty safe sounding and puts a lyric to it that makes you say ` Huh ? '
The lyric is something like ` If I fall , I 'm taking everyone down . ' ''
