This is a track from is the self-titled debut album by the American Country duo Court Yard Hounds , who were founded as a side project of the Dixie Chicks by sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire .
The song is a duet with Jakob Dylan and it 's a wry tale of a couple from the northernmost and southernmost parts of the country who find their biggest obstacle is climatic .
Jakob Dylan told The New York Times : `` There 's something the girls have being sisters , something a family has when they sing together , whether it 's the Louvin Brothers or the Jacksons .
It 's just about the last thing you ca n't reduce to a computer . ''
