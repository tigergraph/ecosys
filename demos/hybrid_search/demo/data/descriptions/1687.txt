Carey explained to Billboard magazine that O.O.C. is short for `` Out Of Control '' : `` Jay-Z said something to me that was really interesting , and I do n't even know if he really remembers this .
He 's known me for a long time , and he 's like , ` You need to use some of your phrases in your music . '
I have my own little slang that I make up and say stupid stuff just for laughs .
-LRB- On -RRB- the song ` O.O.C. ' - that 's a -LRB- American hip-hop producer -RRB- Swizz Beatz track - it means , ` Out of control . '
So me and my friends will say that to each other , ` OK , you 're a little O.O.C. right now , tone it on down . '
-LRB- Female rapper -RRB- Da Brat , who 's a really good , close friend of mine since we worked on ` Always Be My Baby ' - we wrote the lyrics together , and it was so fun .
By saying -LRB- sings -RRB- , ' I get so O.O.C. / So out of control , baby ' we could explain it .
When somebody was helping me type up the lyrics , and they wrote ` Out of Control ' in parenthesis -LRB- by the song title -RRB- , I was like , ` Get rid of that .
It 's ` O.O.C. ' !
Let them figure it out !
It 's not that tough !
I say it in the next line ! ' ''
Carey : '' ` O.O.C. ' is a song that , well , we went in with Swizz Beatz and I actually wrote that song with my friend Da Brat .
And it 's so amazing to write with someone who is also a rapper because she comes with a different set of , with a different perspective .
And then we can put our minds together and come up with something really unique and cool and I think we both kinda understand each other in terms of where we come from as writers and so ` O.O.C. ' seems to be like a favorite of a lot of people and that surprised me , because that night when we left the studio , I was like ' I do n't know , how Swizz feels about it , I do n't know , whatever ' but I really like it .
