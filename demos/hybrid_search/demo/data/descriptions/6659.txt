This is the title track from the eighth studio album by American Nu Metal band , P.O.D. Frontman Sonny Sandoval explained to Christianity Today the song is , `` about the moment our Savior died - Jesus on the cross and what that moment must have felt like with the earthquakes and the sky going black .
It 's that and the imagery of the two thieves , and the one who told Jesus he believed , and Jesus said , `` Today you 'll be in Paradise with me . ''
Ramon Boutviseth directed the song 's music video , which features a man dragging an old television through a busy city street as onlookers take photos of the tormented soul .
He proceeds to remove his shirt , revealing the words `` The Day They Murdered Love , '' carved into his chest .
Sick Jaken of American Hip-Hop supergroup , The Psycho Realm , makes a guest appearance in which he contributes vocals to the song 's chorus .
Sandoval explained the `` Murdered Love '' album title to PureGrainAudio : `` When we started Payable On Death , we were young kids at the time .
It 's a religious term , y' know , when someone passes on , what they leave behind -- we 've always related that to our faith in Christ .
We believe in faith in the ultimate sacrifice for sin and doing that , we have redemption .
So that 's the pathway to our music . ''
`` Murdered Love is a very similar concept , '' he continued .
`` It started out with the song ` The Day We Murdered Love ' , which was based on the idea that the moment Christ was crucified , how dark , how somber and sad it was .
The earth quaked , the sky went black .
It 's talking about desperation for the people who believed in him , just the anguish that must 've been felt .
Y' know , just the idea that we crucified the Savior of the world ; we murdered ... love ! ''
