Natalia Cappuccini is an English singer-songwriter who records under the name of Natalia Kills .
She started her recording career under the name of Verbalicious and released her debut single `` Do n't Play Nice '' in March 2005 .
The song charted at # 11 in the UK singles chart but her then record label later filed for bankruptcy and little was heard from her for a few years.After signing with Interscope imprint Cherrytree Records , Cappuccini was encouraged to find a name that was more direct and descriptive , and she then came up with the stage name , Natalia Kills .
Her debut studio album , Perfectionist initially was dropped in Europe before being released in the United States a few months later on August 16 , 2011 .
The music video features images that are intended to parody the money-obsessed and fashion-concerned .
Cappuccini created the treatment for the clip herself .
`` It 's quite silly , I think - fashion and luxury , '' she told Billboard magazine .
`` I mean , it changes every 3 months . ''
This dancey track , featuring the singer/songwriter 's label head , will.i.am , is the third single from the album .
It was released in the US on June 28 , 2011 , the UK on July 18 2011 and in Germany on July 22 , 2011 .
Cappuccini told Billboard magazine she penned the song soon after moving to Los Angeles from London : `` I wrote it when I was still a waitress , '' she said .
`` I was selling my stuff on eBay just to pay the rent , but I felt just as great as I do now . ''
