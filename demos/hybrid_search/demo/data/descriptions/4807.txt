English musician Charlie Simpson has a strong musical pedigree dating back to one of his mother 's ancestors , Sir William Sterndale Bennett -LRB- 1816-1875 -RRB- , who was a distinguished classical music composer of the romantic school .
Charlie first shot to fame as the lead guitarist of Busted , who were one of the most popular pop acts in the UK during the mid 2000s .
Unfulfilled by the pop star lifestyle , Simpson formed the rock act Fightstar in 2003 .
Following three studio albums , Fightstar initiated an extended hiatus in 2010 , allowing Simpson to focus on his solo career .
This is the lead single from his debut solo full-length album entitled Young Pilgrim , which was released on August 15 , 2011 .
An acoustic-driven record , it was heavily influenced by the 1970s Americana music Simpson listened to growing up .
Simpson was asked by CMU what inspired Young Pilgrim ?
He replied : `` I think this record was inspired by looking at life in retrospect .
` Young Pilgrim ' feels like a journey to me , and it was nice to look back over my life so far and be able to write about it .
I dug out a lot of my 70s Americana records as well to feed my inspiration .
Those albums will always be very special . ''
Simpson told Digital Spy about the song : `` It 's one of the more instrument-heavy songs on the record - I wanted to strike a balance between the acoustic nature and more upbeat instruments .
It 's also the first track I 've ever written with a piano , so it 's a good contrast to other songs on the album . ''
Simpson told CMU about his songwriting process : `` I tend to start writing on either an acoustic guitar or a piano .
Once I have found some melodies I like I then start to build the track up in my head , which usually means writing a drum part and then adding other instrumentation .
I usually leave the lyrics until last , once I have nailed down all of the melodies . ''
