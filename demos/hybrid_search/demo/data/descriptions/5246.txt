Hollywood actor Jeff Bridges is by no means a novelty musician , having revealed his musical talents as early as the 1989 film The Fabulous Baker Boys .
He and Karen Allen -LRB- who is the subject of the song `` Separate Lives '' -RRB- also did a highly proficient version of `` All I Have To Do Is Dream '' on the Starman soundtrack .
Bridges even recorded an album , Be Here Soon , through Ramp Records , a label he created specifically for that project with Michael McDonald .
However it was his portrayal of Bad Blake , a fictional Country musician who falls on hard times in the movie Crazy Heart , which brought him a whole new level of musical recognition .
His turn earned him an Academy Award for best actor in 2009 .
Following the success of Crazy Heart , Bridges took a year off to record and perform his major label debut album which was released on August 16 , 2011 , via jazz music label Blue Note Records and EMI Records .
It found him re-uniting with his longtime friend T-Bone Burnett , who was previously the producer of the Crazy Heart soundtrack .
This piece of California Country Rock was released as the album 's first single on August 15 , 2011 .
It was co-written by the late Stephen Bruton , who co-produced the Crazy Heart soundtrack with Burnett .
Bridges had played the song informally for years before choosing it to lead his self-titled set .
