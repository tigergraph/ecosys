Zac Brown penned this song with his frequent songwriting partner Wyatt Durrette and Country singer-songwriter James Otto , who is best known for his own solo chart-topping tune , `` Just Got Started Lovin ' You . ''
Otto also co-wrote Jamey Johnson 's hit , `` In Color . ''
The song 's message that life is too short not to make time for the people and experiences that matter most continues to resonate with Otto who became a father for the first time in 2011 .
He explained how the arrival in this world of his daughter Ava Katherine has enabled him to live out the song , `` When she came along , I realized it was time to slow down and focus on what really mattered to me in this life , '' he said , `` and that was being there for those unrepeatable moments of her first steps , words and discoveries ... and I 'm still in ` no hurry ' to let those little moments go . ''
The ballad was released as the fifth single from Zac Brown Band 's second album , You Get What You Give .
`` When I got the call , my wife and I stopped what we were doing and started dancing around the kitchen of our house , we were so excited , '' said Otto .
`` There 's nothing like the feeling of knowing one of the most successful bands in country music right now is going to release your song .
I 'm simply blown away , and utterly humbled . ''
