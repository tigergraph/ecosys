While performing this on an MTV awards show , the line `` Feelin ' good from the pills we took '' was bleeped .
As an subtle `` screw you '' to the show , they replaced `` It 's too late to turn back '' with `` It 's too late to take pills '' for the rest of the song .
This incident is further evidence of why they never were as famous as they could have been .
The tune and chorus were lifted from their song `` Portland . ''
