Even though the lyrics are satirical , some listeners perceived it to be racially offensive .
Phil Collins ' phony Mexican accent does n't help matters .
This song was # 13 in Blender magazine 's list of the 50 Worst Songs Ever .
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England , for all above -RRB- Particularly controversial was the part of the song where the immigrant offers sexual favors from his sister as a bribe to let him cross the border .
This was edited from radio versions of the song .
