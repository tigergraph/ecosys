This is a track from Destroyer of the Void , the fifth album by Portland , Oregon-based experimental folk rock band Blitzen Trapper .
The band 's Marty Marquis described to Billboard magazine this song as `` a really crazy , psychedelic tale along the lines of Furr but the arrangements are not so folky and simple .
The tale itself and the poetry that expresses it is , I think , the next level above what we did with Furr . ''
