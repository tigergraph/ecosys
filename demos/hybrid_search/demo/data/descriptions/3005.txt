The Bay City Rollers were a Scottish boy band who scored their first UK hit in 1971 with `` Keep On Dancing . ''
In 1975 , they had the UK 's best-selling single with `` Bye Bye Baby , '' and were primed to break through in America .
This infectious Pop song , with its very memorable chant -LRB- S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y ... Night ! -RRB-
stormed the States , becoming the first US # 1 hit of 1976 -LRB- America 's bicentennial -RRB- .
The song got a huge publicity push , and the band made their US TV debut performing the song on Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell , which was an Ed Sullivan-style variety show that lasted just a few months , but had a huge viewership since there was n't much else to watch .
The Bay City Rollers may not have lived up to the huge hype they received in America , but they did have 5 other Top 40 hits in the States , including `` Money Honey , '' `` You Made Me Believe In Magic '' and `` Rock And Roll Love Letter . ''
It took 35 years for another song with a day of the week in the title to reach # 1 in America .
Katy Perry finally broke the drought when `` Last Friday Night -LRB- T.G.I.F. -RRB- '' reached the top spot in 2011 .
This was written by the songwriting team of Bill Martin and Phil Coulter , who had written 4 UK # 1 hits , including `` Puppet on a String , '' which won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1967 for Sandie Shaw .
This song was first recorded in 1973 with original Rollers vocalist Nobby Clarke , but this version tanked when it was released in the UK .
The band , as well as songwriters Martin and Coulter , had faith in the song and re-recorded it for US versions of their 1975 album Would n't You Like It .
