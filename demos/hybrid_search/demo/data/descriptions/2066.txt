Nick Carter began work on his second solo album in 2003 , but the recordings were aborted when the Backstreet Boys returned to the studio .
He eventually completed I 'm Taking Off in 2010 and released the record on February 2 , 2011 in Japan and May 24 , 2011 in the USA .
Nick explained the meaning of the album title to AOL Music : `` It means I 'm finally blasting off into outer space and the world unknown and the place that I always wanted to go , but I had to assemble all the pieces and tools to create that rocket to ride in .
I did n't have all the necessary supplies to build my spaceship .
It 's about time for me and I feel like I was ready . ''
This title track was written by Nick with Canadian record producer Matthew Gerrard , who was also responsible for the Backstreet Boy 's 2002 debut solo single , `` Help Me . ''
