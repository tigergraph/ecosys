The England-based R&B / Soul band Sade released their second greatest hits studio album , The Ultimate Collection , on May 3 , 2011 .
The disc contained three new songs , including this post-break-up ballad , where a desperate Sade Adu conveys the emotion of love lost .
She pleads , `` Call on me , baby / If there 's anything I can do for you / Please , call on me , baby / Help me see it through . ''
Phil Lynott , who was the singer of Thin Lizzy , wrote the song and it was originally recorded by the Irish rock band on their Nightlife album .
The claim has been made that the bulk of the song was written by Irish guitarist Gary Moore , who briefly joined Lizzy following the sudden departure of guitarist Eric Bell , but had left the band by the time the album was put together in the autumn of 1974 .
