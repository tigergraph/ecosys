It also serves as the album 's title track .
Hesketh explained to Artist Direct why she titled the LP Hands : `` Well , it 's the name of the first demo that I did as Little Boots .
It 's about having faith in your hands and what you can make .
It 's about taking things into your own hands , having confidence in yourself and what you can achieve .
There are so many different connotations to the word that you can have a variety of meanings .
I try to give listeners a lot of layers with the music , and they can take what they want to from it . ''
