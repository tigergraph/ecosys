Several of the tracks on English indie rock band Field Music 's fourth album find them questioning aspects of the modern life .
This song is about the struggle to contribute anything worthwhile in the political arena .
Co-frontman David Brewis told Mojo magazine : `` Although I 've had a year of outright political outrage , ` Choosing Sides ' is about the difficulty of being politically engaged .
The level of political discourse is depressing , enraging .
And you feel you ca n't do a bloody thing about it . ''
