Currington told AOL the story of this song , which he wrote with Bob DiPiero and Scotty Emerick : '' ' I Shall Return ' came about kind of on accident also .
I was sitting in an office at a publishing company one day , playing on my gut string guitar , and the first line of the song just kind of fell out with the melody .
As I was singing it , two writers , two of my buddies , happened to be walking by the room at that time .
They asked me what I was singing , I told them , just kind of goofing around , and they said ` Man , we oughta finish this ! '
It was finished in a couple of hours .
It remains a fun track for me on the album , and I love to hear it , love to hear the guitars in it . ''
