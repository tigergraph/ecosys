The title track to British Indie Rock band Maccabees third album also serves as an introduction to the record .
Guitarist Felix White told NME : `` We wanted the intro to be that ' I Wan na Be Adored ' - style zooming in to a record , setting the tone . ''
Weeks told NME why they named the album after this track : `` Given to the wild , is the first line on the album -LRB- on the second track `` Child '' -RRB- and was a title idea that we had pretty early on .
But it was n't until we 'd finished recording that we could come back to it and know that it suited .
It just felt right .
`` He added : `` Being ` given to the wild , ' it 's not a choice that you 've made .
It 's something out of your control . ''
The band worked on Given To The Wild at both Rockfield Studios in Wales and their rehearsal space in London 's Elephant and Castle district , before decamping to Suffolk to finish the record .
`` For the first time we were n't thrashing it out in a rehearsal room , we were writing on our own , at home or in our studio , '' vocalist Orlando Weeks told The Sun .
`` I think that is why the record sounds so cinematic , because it 's constructed from different pieces of music we had written . ''
