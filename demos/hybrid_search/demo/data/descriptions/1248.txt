Katy Perry co-wrote this song , along with Billy Steinberg and his songwriting partner Josh Alexander .
Steinberg has written several US # 1 hits dating back to the mid-1980s , mostly with Tom Kelly composing the music .
They include `` Eternal Flame , '' `` Like A Virgin '' and `` True Colors . ''
Since linking up with Alexander , their credits include Nicole Scherzinger 's UK # 1 hit `` Do n't Hold Your Breath . ''
The song subverts the traditional homemaker role that women once took on after they were married .
Selena told Billboard magazine : '' ` That 's More Like It ' is a little bit of a cheeky '50s kind of theme .
Back then you always kind of assumed that the woman would cook for you and the guys would go work .
The song kind of flips that and says ` you can massage my feet , you can take care of me , you can cook me dinner . '
I think girls will enjoy singing that though I apologize to all of the boys who will be hearing that song . ''
