This album is based on the 1985 Miners strike in Wales , which was a very hard and bitter time .
The album has a pull out map of the area of Wales -LRB- UK -RRB- that paid a heavy price for losing the strike .
This track is based on a sad event that took place when an innocent Taxi driver -LRB- Mr. Wilkie -RRB- was taking a working miner -LRB- called scabs by the strikers -RRB- in to the pit .
Two striking miners dropped a 46lb concrete block and a concrete post weighing 65lbs from a bridge over the head of the Valleys Road at Rhymner .
It fell on the taxi and the driver was killed within seconds from head and chest injuries .
The passenger , Mr. Williams , was unhurt but deeply traumatized .
The miners were jailed for life .
The story of the album is told from the point of an handicapped boy Billy who stays with his uncle in the USA while the strike was going on , but he is soon homesick .
-LRB- thanks , Graham - Port Talbot , Wales , for above 2 -RRB-
