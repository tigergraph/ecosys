The Click Five keyboardist Ben Romans has to reach back in his memory for this song .
But when he gets there , the memory is clear : `` That was a fun situation , '' he says .
`` Things were moving kind of fast in the days back in 2005 .
And we had a day off after this long run in L.A. doing a whole lot of press and shows and just all kinds of mayhem .
And I remember we wanted to do this Christmas album .
We were listening to the Cars a lot , and Tim Kelly and I went to Santa Monica Beach , and just hung out .
And it was one of those awesome moments where we just kind of wrote the song on a day off on the beach .
And it was a Christmas song , '' he laughs .
`` It was sunny out .
But it 's just a typical song , it 's just kind of tongue-in-cheek song about getting everything you want , but the one thing you 'd rather have .
It 's the same concept as the Beatles ' wrote about with ` Money Ca n't Buy You Love . '
it 's just that whole same vein of there 's always those materialistic things , but what you really want is that feeling.It was really like a quick song , actually .
We kind of just banged it out .
And I think we also recorded it like really fast , too .
It was like two days and we were done .
Things were moving so fast , though , I think that 's just kind of what happened . ''
