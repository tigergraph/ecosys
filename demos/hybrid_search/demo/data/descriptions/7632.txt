Mick Jagger got the title for '' -LRB- I Ca n't Get No -RRB- Satisfaction '' from the line in this : `` Ca n't get no satisfaction from the judge . ''
This was Berry 's second single , after `` Maybellene . ''
Officially titled `` Thirty Days -LRB- To Come Back Home -RRB- , '' it is usually alluded to as simply `` Thirty Days . ''
According to Berry 's piano player and collaborator Johnnie Johnson in Bruce Pegg 's unauthorized biography Brown Eyed Handsome Man ... , like the B-Side `` Together -LRB- We Will Always Be -RRB- , '' this track was written by Berry while they were on the road , and recorded in haste at Chicago .
`` I do n't think that it took more than an hour for each one , '' he said .
An attempt to reproduce `` Maybellene , '' it was released on the Chess label , made # 8 on the R&B chart , but never troubled the Hot 100 , and was soon covered by Ernest Tubb on Decca .
