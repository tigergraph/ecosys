This ballad is from the 2011 movie The Muppets .
It finds the film 's main characters , Gary -LRB- Jason Segel -RRB- and Walter , -LRB- Peter Linz -RRB- questioning themselves on the subject of their true identities .
The song also features Bill Barretta as Gary 's Muppet form and Jim Parsons as Walter 's human form .
It was released on November 22 , 2011 as part of the film 's soundtrack .
Along with `` Real in Rio '' from the movie Rio , this was one of just two songs nominated for the Best Original Song category at the 84th Academy Awards .
It was the third Muppet song to be nominated for an Oscar , following `` Rainbow Connection '' and `` The First Time It Happens . ''
2012 was a long way from the days when some of the biggest hits were written for movies -LRB- example : `` Eye Of The Tiger '' losing to `` Up Where We Belong -RRB- , and this marked the first time that just two songs were nominated - Golden Globe entries `` Hello Hello '' -LRB- from Gnomeo & Juliet -RRB- `` Lay Your Head Down '' -LRB- from Albert Nobbs -RRB- were snubbed .
In an interview before the Oscar ceremony , McKenzie discussed the writing of the song with the radio network NPR .
He explained that there were some unusual lyrical obstacles to overcome , including resisting the temptation to rhyme Muppets with ` puppets . '
Said the New Zealander : `` Early on , I was going to get ` puppet ' in there , but you ca n't do that .
Muppets are real .
So then I was riffing as to how I could get that melody and those lyrics to flip back and forth , so that 's why I ended up rhyming Muppet with Muppet and man with man . ''
The song was written for the movie by Bret McKenzie , who is best known for being one half of the musical comedy duo Flight of the Conchords .
He told MTV : `` I really wanted -LSB- this song -RSB- to be hilarious and beautiful , and I feel like we got that combination .
It 's sincere but ridiculous .
The idea of children singing the song at school cracks me up . ''
This won the Oscar for Best Original Song .
In his acceptance speech , McKenzie reminisced about watching the Muppets in his native New Zealand .
`` I was genuinely starstruck when I finally met Kermit the Frog , '' he recalled .
`` Once you get to know him , he 's just a normal frog .
And like many stars here tonight , he 's a lot shorter in real life . ''
McKenzie told NPR that when the time came for Jason Segel to perform the track , McKenzie acted it out for him as a guide .
He explained : `` I would sing a line and he 'd watch me through the studio window .
And I 'd sing it quite dramatically .
And he would copy , and that 's how we got the performance going . ''
