The music video was shot on October 9 , 2009 in The Bank club at Bellagio in Las Vegas .
The clip has attracted over 10 million views online .
The song features Flo Rida , Sean Kingston and Tiësto , who also produced the track .
Three 6 Mafia 's Juicy J told Artist Direct : `` We just went into the studio and did it .
Tiësto made the track , and we recorded our parts .
Sean Kingston came in on the record , and it 's banging .
It 's heating up , man .
Flo Rida 's on it too .
It 's one of those records that when it comes on you 're like , `` Holy s -- t ! ''
We 've got a lot of different fans .
We 've got a pop fan base and we 've got our original fan base , so we tried to please everybody on this new album .
The record is for original Three 6 Mafia fans , and we 've got other kinds of songs on there for people that like the pop stuff .
We 've got a huge following . ''
Tiesto told MTV News about the collaboration : `` It was an amazing experience to work with those guys , '' he recalled .
`` I just made in the studio a little beat , a little melody .
I never really developed it .
And they went to the studios and they were all sitting right next to each other - Three 6 Mafia , Sean Kingston and Flo Rida - and the whole collaboration comes together .
It 's phenomenal how something so underground can become so big . ''
