Primus frontman Les Claypool is a keen fisherman and this song is about the decline in the salmon fishing industry in Northern California .
He explained to Artist Direct : `` I have a handful of friends who are commercial fishermen .
It has always has been hard for them ; it 's not like fishermen get rich .
But now they 're going the way of the lumberjack .
When you 've got over 125 golf courses down in the desert in Palm Springs and there 's water being diverted there from the North , it 's going to effect the fish populations .
I 've always been outspoken about that notion of sacrificing one industry , one legacy , for another that just happens to have a lot of money around it .
I mean , I like hanging out on the golf course , too , -LSB- laughs -RSB- but this seems a little ridiculous . ''
