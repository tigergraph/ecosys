Musically , the first single from The Heavy 's third album , The Glorious Dead , was inspired by a 1978 Fender Precision Bass that guitarist Dan Taylor happened upon while writing for the LP .
`` The first baseline I played was ` What Makes a Good Man , ' '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` The song basically came from that guitar .
It was almost as if we were destined to be together . ''
The song was used in the launch trailer for the 2012 video game Sleeping Dogs .
