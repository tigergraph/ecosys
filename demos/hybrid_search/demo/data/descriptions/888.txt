This song is probably about heroin use .
The lines , `` Cut up from the chase , '' `` Nothing better , the feeling is so fine , '' `` Delicate and wild , '' `` Dying to get high '' and `` love stream flow '' all support this interpretation , as well as the abundance of RHCP songs about heroin use .
