Mike Rosenberg is a British singer-songwriter who records under the name of Passenger .
He explained this song 's meaning to VH1 : `` As we get older , we become cynical as far as love goes .
When you first fall in love at 15 , it 's the most wonderful and incredible thing .
And then , inevitably , that probably does n't work out as a relationship and your heart is broke and you do n't know what to do . ''
