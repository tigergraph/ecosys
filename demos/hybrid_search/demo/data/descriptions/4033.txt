This track is from American hard rock band Day of Fire 's third studio album , Losing All .
It was co-written by American Idol finalist and Daughtry frontman , Chris Daughtry .
Day of Fire vocalist Josh Brown told Artist Direct about the song : `` It 's written about me and my wife .
During the writing of the record , we 'd been married for eight years and we were separated for a year there .
We almost got a divorce .
For me , that song is one of the most truthful songs on the record .
It 's about wishing you could go back and change things -- even if you could n't change them , you would go back and do it all over again .
Dean Deleo from Stone Temple Pilots listened to it and thought it was awesome , so that 's good enough for me . ''
