This is the fourth single from American rapper Diddy 's fifth studio album , Last Train to Paris , which he recorded with his group Dirty Money .
The song features the Canadian rapper Drake and was originally named `` Hurt . ''
Gil Green directed the song 's music video .
Said Diddy to MTV News : '' -LSB- The clip -RSB- is really about me being in a relationship with a young lady and you 're constantly loving this person .
And hoping that this day comes where they change and they love you back .
`` Green added that he saw the visual as framing Diddy in a detached relationship .
`` We show these moments of him and his love but you could tell there 's an emotional distance , '' he explained .
Last Train To Paris is a concept album that tells a love story , which coincides with a journey from London to Paris .
Diddy told Spin magazine the narrative is based on real life experiences .
He explained : `` It 's about different pieces of different relationships I 've had , and my unsuccessful love life .
That was the concept of the album : to talk about something that 's been my Kryptonite . ''
Diddy explained to MTV News : `` The concept of the song is about when you love somebody so much that you forget about yourself .
You love them more than you love yourself . ''
Diddy told MTV News that he wanted to get some of hip hop 's young guns on board for Last Train To Paris and Drake was more than willing to come for the ride .
Said Diddy : `` I wanted to be smart enough to go to the newest generation , the flyest , young gun of MCs and writers and humbly ask them for help , '' he said .
`` To be honest , a lot of cats were busy .
I can respect that .
But Drake took the time to stop what he was doing and he was the hottest one in the game .
He came to my house for two days , we went to Canada for three days . ''
