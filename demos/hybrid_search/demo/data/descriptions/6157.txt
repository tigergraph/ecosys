This song is about a guy who loves a girl so much that even though she is not with him , he still will be happy as long as she is too .
-LRB- thanks , Boris - Perth , Australia -RRB- An acoustic version of this song was included as a bonus track on the rerelease of Chiodos ' 2005 album All 's Well That Ends Well .
Craig Owens of Chiodos said at a concert that this was one of the first songs he wrote , when he was 15 years old .
It is about a girl that he really liked , but he did n't talk to her much and never dated her - he just admired her from a distance .
-LRB- thanks , Jennifer - St.Louis , MO -RRB-
