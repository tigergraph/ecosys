American Hardcore band Hatebreed close their sixth studio album , The Divinity of Purpose , with this cut .
Vocalist Jamey Jasta explained to Artist Direct that the song 's subject matter is something the band touched on with the Hatebreed track `` No Halos for the Heartless . '' ''
It almost has more relevance now , '' he added , `` three years later when you look at the state of our society with addiction and the way we give celebrity to people who have such problems and really do n't need to be under spotlight .
It was a good way to close out the record .
Lyrically , it says a lot about our view on things . ''
