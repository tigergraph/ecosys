Odell penned this song during a dark time in his life .
He explained to Artist Direct : `` It was n't long after I signed my deal , I had actually split up with my girlfriend .
I had a lot of time on my hands because I was trying to finish up writing the album .
I 'd do this thing where I 'd go to my flat in London and I 'd lock myself up for a day .
I 'd buy enough food , drinks , and cigarettes .
I 'd write as many songs as I could .
I 'd try different things , see what happens , and experiment . ''
`` One of those songs happened to be ` Ca n't Pretend , ' '' he continued .
`` It lived on my phone for a long time .
I recorded it on my phone , and I did n't really do anything with it .
When I got to the studio , I heard it again and thought , ` This sounds really cool .
Why do n't I try it with a band ? '
It locked in a little bit more and felt quite compelling .
I never intended for that song to be on the album .
It felt more like just one feeling than a song .
It worked so well live though and in recording that it ended up on the album . ''
