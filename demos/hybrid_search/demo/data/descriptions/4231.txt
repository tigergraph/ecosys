The song title is a French nickname for someone who is seen as all dressed up but still lacking grace and manners .
It is widely interpreted as a thinly veiled attack on French president Francois Hollande , in which Bruni mocks his `` sovereign air . ''
However , the singer denied to UK newspaper The Sunday Telegraph he is the titular bird .
`` No , '' Bruni insisted , `` le pingouin is anyone unpleasant , aggressive , badly brought up , we all have our penguins . ''
`` Actually , children really like Le Pingouin , it 's like a sort of nursery rhyme , '' she added .
`` The album is a sort of tribute , not to the grandiose lyric creations of Brel or Ferr√© , but to the little jewels you also find in French chanson . ''
