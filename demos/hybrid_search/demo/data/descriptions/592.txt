Vocalist Max Bemis -LRB- From Alternative Press -RRB- : `` This song was written as I was finishing up the record .
I felt like we needed an anthem to define the place I have been brought to and define the sense of self-preservation and self-worth .
It talks about a sense of fighting against the people who try to put me down , not necessarily being angry and confrontational against the world .
I think this song is a healthy version of ` Hate Everyone ' in which this anger is actually being channeled for the greater good and not blindly thrown out there for anyone who walks by .
It 's about being proud of who you are and angry at anyone who would try to rob you of that .
I felt like this was an important component to the record because a lot of Say Anything songs are very self-conscious and questioning .
I needed a song that said , ` Screw you .
This is who I am and who I will be for the rest of my life . '
This is that song .
It 's important for anyone who likes our band to have this song .
It 's unapologetic . ''
