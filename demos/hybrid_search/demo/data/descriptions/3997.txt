This song is an example of how Our Lady Peace challenged themselves while making Curve .
When we spoke with OLP guitarist Steve Mazur in 2012 , he said , `` There are definitely some songs on the record where we 're stretching into some very new ground . ''
Mazur went on to explain that `` Window Seat '' is one tune that takes OLP to an entirely different place .
This song is based around some very dreamy guitar sounds and swells .
Steve Mazur told us how it came together : `` When we started making this record , we recorded a few songs , and a fellow named Jason -LRB- Lader -RRB- , who actually ended up producing the record with us , came in , heard what we were doing , and said , ` Why are you guys making music like this ?
It 's not the kind of music you listen to or love .
` So we trashed what we were doing , decided to bring him on board to produce the record with us , and we had a big discussion about challenging ourselves and really moving into some new ground and how to do that specifically .
One thing we said was that we 've got to challenge it from the bottom up - rhythm parts , chord progressions , guitar parts - the sonics of the record.For that song specifically , Raine kind of said , ` Go write me a chord progression that 's something that we would not normally use . '
So I went out and listened to a bunch of Bowie stuff and analyzed it .
I had that progression and brought it in .
It was something really new for us , so we kind of just built it around that in that song . ''
