This song features a children 's choir .
PB & J 's Peter MÃ³ren told MTV News that the American rapper Jay-Z was an unlikely inspiration .
He explained : `` We listened to Jay-Z 's ` Hard Knock Life ' with the ` Annie ' sample , and we needed clear , bright voices going straight through little radios .
So we recorded with a children 's choir .
Plus , you know , cheap labor . ''
Kanye West is a fan of the Swedish three-piece .
He sampled Peter Bjorn and John 's breakthrough single `` Young Folks '' for a track by the same name on his mixtape Ca n't Tell Me Nothing and in January 2009 he posted this track on his blog .
