This song finds a heavily auto-tuned West lamenting over a failed relationship with a good girl gone bad .
`` This is the time when my heart got shot down , '' he recounts .
Kid Cudi arrives at the end to spit the outro .
The former GOOD Music man is a frequent contributor to West 's work with writing credits on several 808s & Heartbreak tracks as well as features on `` Welcome to Heartbreak , '' `` Gorgeous '' and `` All of the Lights . ''
The song features a chopped up sample of Dancehall artist Popcaan taken from Pusha T 's `` Blocka . ''
The street anthem is from the Clipse man 's Wrath of Caine mixtape and the track also features Travis Scott .
West also interpolates Lords of the Underground 's 1993 single `` Chief Rocka . ''
A line on his first verse , `` the one Chief Rocka , number one Chief Rocka , '' was the hook of the original song .
Grand Hustle rapper Travis Scott first became widely known for his production and verse on GOOD Music 's `` Sin City , '' and West enlisted the Texan early on to travel to Paris to work on Yeezus .
This is one of several tracks that he has co-producing credits on .
`` I went to Paris super early , '' he told MTV News .
`` At one point it was just me , Kanye and Noah -LSB- in the studio -RSB- , and that 's when he first introduced me to some of the -LSB- song -RSB- ideas .
I was just around him a lot , especially for this album , curating sonics , '' he added .
`` It 's like crazy memories . ''
`` I just heard the songs and added to -LSB- them -RSB- , '' Travis said of his contributions .
`` I was just giving my thoughts .
Like I said , his process of working , it 's ill , man .
We -LSB- were just trying out -RSB- mad ideas and then whatever comes out , comes out . ''
The Dallas-based producer S1 , -LRB- also known as Symbolyc One -RRB- , supplied the beat .
He previously worked with West on his My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy single , `` Power . ''
Speaking with Hip Hop Magazine , S1 recalled his contribution : `` Before Kanye started this album he had like 20 beats from me on hold , but what 's crazy is none of those 20 joints made the album , '' he said . ''
` Guilt Trip ' was actually a joint I did in London for Watch the Throne .
In fact , Kanye and Jay were in the room with me when I did it .
I did it on the spot and they loved it -- Kanye laid a verse immediately on it , and he ended up using it for this particular project .
I make music to the best of my ability and move on , ` Guilt Trip ' is an example of that -- a seed I planted a while back that was used later on . ''
