Guitarist Phil Demmel told Sonic Excess magazine why the band decided to write lyrics about addiction for this song .
He explained : `` It was a song without lyrics really for a while , without a concept .
We kind of came up with an idea to write about addicts and addiction , when talking to each other and watching Breaking Bad episodes to kind of catch up and start again to see it .
-LRB- laughs -RRB- It 's not a song about hope .
It 's just a song about being in the throes of addiction , in its claws , and a lot of my lyrics are in there .
So , there 's a lot of descriptive thoughts of addiction .
It 's not a song of hope for sure .
It 's not ` Stairway To Heaven . ' ''
The phrase `` Pearls Before Swine '' originates from Jesus ' Sermon on the Mount -LRB- as reported in Matthew 7v6 -RRB- .
He is saying that people of faith should be discerning in what they say and do as valuable things -LRB- such as pearls -RRB- should not be put in front of people -LRB- or swine -RRB- who do not appreciate their worth .
