Karen O married noted film and music-video director Barnaby Clay in late 2011 .
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs vocalist penned this delicate vow of love and devotion and sang it to her husband at their marriage reception .
Karen told NME : `` This is our sealing the deal song .
It 's also a song about finding The One .
I wrote it for my wedding .
We did n't have vows at my wedding .
I feel really awkward about saying stuff - so saying it in a song made perfect sense . ''
Guitarist and keyboardist Nick Zinner told Spin magazine this minimalist track features his favorite guitar moment on the entire Mosquito album .
`` We recorded the guitar for that the last day we were in El Paso , '' he said . ''
-LRB- Co-producer Dave -RRB- Sitek was really into building bonfires at that time , and the last night we all walked through the fire .
Karen and I fu -- ng walked through the fire together .
`` He added : `` That will forever be one of my strongest memories .
After that , we did the last piece of music that we recorded in Texas .
One take , one note . ''
