Keith told Artist Direct that this song is `` about a preacher 's rebel daughter running off on the back of a motorcycle with a bad boy .
The lyrics go , ` She is a rebel child , a preacher 's daughter , baptized in dirty water . '
I knew that those lyrics would make the single . ''
This was Keith 's 18th # 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart and his 15th chart-topper of the ' 00s .
He already held the record for the most chart-toppers in the '90s , and with this song he extended his lead .
This song was written by Toby Keith together with Vicky McGehee , who also wrote Jason Aldean 's hit `` Johnny Cash . ''
Keith explained on the press release for That Do n't Make Me a Bad Guy why he hooked up with McGehee : `` Vicky and I were co-Songwriters of the Year a couple years ago at the BMI Awards .
After the awards were over someone said , ` You 've got two songwriters of the year here , you ought to get together and write one . '
So she came out on the road , we wrote a couple songs and this was one of them . ''
