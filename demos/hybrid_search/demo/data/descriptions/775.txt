Palms is an American Rock band that consists of Deftones ' vocalist Chino Moreno and three members of the Post-Metal band Isis : bassist Jeff Caxide , drummer Aaron Harris and guitarist Bryant Clifford Meyer .
This opening track from their debut album was laid down at Harris ' house .
Vocalist Chino Moreno explained to Artist Direct : `` To me , it 's a great foundation of what the sound of the group is .
It starts vaguely electronic , and it opens up .
There are really pretty verses .
Then , when it gets to the chorus , it sounds very triumphant .
I picture a female warrior whether it 's Joan of Arc or another strong female .
It 's the beauty of it , but there 's power too .
When we got to that song , I feel like we found what we were trying to do with this project .
This was probably halfway through writing the vocals .
We finished that up at his pad .
Then , I remember we walked up the street to El Compadre , had a beer , and sat at the bar there in the daytime .
I thought , ` Wow , this is actually going to be pretty good . '
Like I said before , I took the song , and I knew it had potential to be great . ''
