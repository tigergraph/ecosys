This was the first song written for English indie rock band The Coral 's fifth full-length studio album , Butterfly House .
Vocalist and lyricist James Skelly is an avid reader of graphic novels and this song was inspired by a comic book .
He explained to Spinner UK : `` That was inspired by Swamp Thing , you know , the Alan Moore comic ?
He uses the land as a metaphor for so many other things and I liked that idea .
In Green Is The Colour , it could just be about a girl with green eyes walking in a forest , but it 's more about jealousy and being trapped . ''
