This song follows on from `` Planets '' as M. Shadows sings about getting cast into space with your loved one to die after the planets collide .
Guitarist Synyster Gates commented to MusicRadar.com : `` It 's a cool way to end the record -- not a typical ballad , but it 's not soft or sugary , either .
The song takes you to an emotional place , especially if you pay attention to the lyrics , which are some of the best Matt has ever written . ''
He added ; `` The song is about coming to the realization that you 've lost the battle , but at least you 're with that one special person who matters .
It 's something of an apocalyptic love story , which is pretty unique for us . ''
