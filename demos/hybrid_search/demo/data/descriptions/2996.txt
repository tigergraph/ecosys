I Got Your Country Right Here is the fourth studio album by American Country music artist Gretchen Wilson .
It is also the first release for Wilson 's personal label , Redneck Records , which she founded after leaving Sony Music Nashville in 2009 .
Rivers Rutherford together with Sam and Annie Tate penned this song .
Wilson told CMT News about it : `` The songwriter , Rivers Rutherford , I asked him to come out to my studio , and he pretty much set up in one room with his acoustic guitar and I set up in another room .
All we did afterwards was add a little cello .
I felt like it just needed a little something , but I did n't want it to get big because it 's such a personal song .
What a beautiful song .
It 's hard for me to sing it without tearing up a little bit .
I 've known this song for about four years , and that was one of the decisions I made after I left Sony - to put that song on there . ''
