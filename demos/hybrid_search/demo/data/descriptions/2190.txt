A year before the global financial meltdown that lead to the occupy movement , Madball released Infiltrate the System , an album that deals with taking on established power structures and subverting authority .
The title track started with a riff their bass player Hoya Roc came up with .
Guitarist Mitts wrote the music for the chorus and their lead singer Freddy Cricien came up with the words .
The song has a distinctive breakdown at the end , which went through a few iterations before the band was happy with it .
In our interview with Madball guitarist Mitts , he explained : `` We had it written , everything up to that part , and we were rehearsing it , but we did n't have an end part for it .
We were stuck on it , and finally I went home and I wrote an end part to it and demoed it and played it for the guys .
I liked it , and my singer liked it even to the point where he wrote some lyrics over it .
I even have somewhere - not that it will ever see the light of day - but I have a version of it where you hear an alternate ending .
My bass player , he did n't like it , so it kind of motivated him - if he did n't put something on there , then it was going to stick , and I know he did n't like it .
He ended up going home and coming in one day and being , ` All right , try this . '
He put this ending on it that 's the ending you hear now , and nobody can complain because that 's the way the song finished , and it fits great now .
At the time I was like , ` Oh , that 's very different . '
But that 's what we ended up going with and that 's how the song is today . ''
