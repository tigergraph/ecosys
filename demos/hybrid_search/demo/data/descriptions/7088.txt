This was embraced as a theme song by 2010 NHL Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks during their successful season , which culminated in them winning their first championship since 1961 .
This was the first hit for The Fratellis , and it became a popular song among soccer fans , where it is often played at games .
The Celtic team of the Scottish Premier League often uses the song .
John Lawler recalled to the Guardian newspaper June 27 , 2008 about writing the song : `` I remember the night I wrote it - I found the notebook with the lyrics the other night .
It came to me really quickly .
I was going -LSB- sings the familiar refrain -RSB- ` Do-do-do-do-do-do ' and it was so easy to write that I could n't believe nobody had ever used -LSB- the melody -RSB- before . ''
This is by far the band 's best-known work , but Jon Fratelli calls it `` just another song . ''
`` I really never have , and never will , think about it in any special way , '' he said in 2013 .
`` It 's just a song in the middle of a bunch of others songs .
I had n't even written ` Chelsea Dagger ' when we got our first record deal .
So I know that there was other stuff that people were interested in . ''
Jon adds that the song has been wonderful for the band , as its royalties have supported them financially .
