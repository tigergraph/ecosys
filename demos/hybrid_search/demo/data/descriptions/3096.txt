Estelle recorded two versions of the song , one with R&B singer-songwriter John Legend and the other one with rapper Nas .
Two versions of the video were shot as well , each with one of the featured artists .
The Sanaa Hamri directed clips were shot in Brooklyn and both feature Grey 's Anatomy actor Jesse Williams as the singer 's love interest .
The song was a commercial flop , only reaching # 71 on Billboard 's Hot R&B / Hip-Hop Songs .
Because of its underperformance , `` Fall in Love '' , was ultimately left off the final track listing of All Of Me .
