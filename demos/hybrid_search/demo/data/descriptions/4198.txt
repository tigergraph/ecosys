This was the first Placebo album that drummer Steve Forrest played on .
For Forrest , jamming on this track on his first day in the studio was a defining moment .
He explained to Click Music : `` From the very first time we played together , it just popped into my head that this is the last band I am ever going to be in .
It was on my first day and in the first five minutes playing with each other , but as soon as we started jamming ` Kitty Litter , ' I just felt it : I 'm not going anywhere and I am going to make damn sure I get this job and keep it , you have gone 15 years and I am going to take you 15 more .
So , I think the very first time we played together was the defining moment .
For me it was like this is the band I have been searching for all these years , I have played with all these different bands and dealt with different people but it was like finally I have found it , I 've found the love of my life .
