This song has two major interpretations .
It is widely believed to be about genetically engineering puppies that will never grow old as stated by lead vocalist/guitarist Matt Bellamy .
It could also be a reference to his love for the electric guitar , and how he only has to plug it in and play , for all his critics to be proven wrong -LRB- `` crucifies my enemies '' -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , Phill - Columbia , SC -RRB- On the show Muse : The Making of Origin of Symmetry , which aired on the UK radio station Xfm , lead singer Matthew Bellamy described this song as : `` A feeling of not being connected to each other , but we are , and it 's a feeling of the mind evolving from the body , but when that happens you just get this yearn to do something physical and feel something sensational . ''
This song came top of a 2010 poll compiled by Total Guitar magazine in to find the Best Guitar Riff of the 21st Century .
It was followed by Velvet Revolver 's Slither in second place and Avenged Sevenfold 's Afterlife in third .
Guitarist Matt Bellamy used a Hugh Manson custom electric guitar , with a built-in Z Vex Fuzz Factory set for the classical-influenced intro riff .
The song helped Bellamy establish himself as one of the most innovative guitarists of his generation .
Featured as the opening track on the band 's second album Origin of Symmetry , the song began as a piece played during the soundcheck during the band 's 1999 tour supporting the Foo Fighters , with the piano intro written later .
