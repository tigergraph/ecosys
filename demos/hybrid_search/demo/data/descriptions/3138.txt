This is the B-side to `` Caravan , '' the first single from Rush 's 2011 album Clockwork Angels .
The song is an additional studio track whose title stands for the lyric `` brought up to believe '' .
It was recorded the same day as `` Caravan '' on April 13 , 2010 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville with producer Nick Raskulinecz .
Geddy Lee plays a theremin in the middle part of this song .
The Theremin was invented by a young Russian scientist Leon Theremin in 1919 and was famously used on Star Trek and The Beach Boys `` Good Vibrations . ''
Raskulinecz told MusicRadar they came across a theremin lying around in the studio , `` So we took the theremin , '' he said , `` plugged it into an amp , put some delay and a phaser on it , and he did a solo .
I think he might have played one back in the '70s .
His performance is cool .
He did it once and it worked out great . ''
Guitarist Alex Lifeson told Musicradar.com about his guitar solo : `` At first we experimented with something more traditional , but it just sounded , I do n't know ... ordinary .
So we decided to punctuate points in the solo section with a more screaming guitar presence .
I think it worked . ''
This is the second song on the tracklisting of Clockwork Angels .
The album is built around a narrative of a young man 's journey to follow his dreams in a dystopian alternate world .
Bassist-singer Geddy Lee told MusicRadar.com : `` This is more about his personal upbringing and values that were instilled into this character and this is what you find when he goes out and faces this world that is not so cool .
This and ` Caravan ' were the first two pieces of the puzzle , the rest of it was all to be filled in later -LRB- laughs -RRB- ! ''
