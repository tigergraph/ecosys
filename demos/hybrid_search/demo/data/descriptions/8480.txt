Alanis Morissette 's eighth studio album Havoc and Bright Lights is also her first since giving birth to her first child , Ever Imre Morissette-Treadway .
While motherhood is a theme , the songs she wrote for the record explore other elements of her new life .
`` The form -LSB- of the album -RSB- is the motherhood , but the essence of it really is a deepening of intimacy and a deepening of commitment , and therefore there being a lot of healing , '' she explained to MTV News .
`` I 'm healing a lot of wounds from my childhood , and so is my husband , and ... that healing definitely shows up in songs like 'Em pathy ' and ` Lens , ' the whole idea of fostering connection , that horrible feeling of disconnection from God or each other or our own selves .
It 's a very hollow , piercing , terrible feeling . ''
