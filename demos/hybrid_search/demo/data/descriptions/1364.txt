On this track Lifehouse vocalist and principal songwriter Jason Wade is assisted in his writing duties by Chris Daughtry and Richard Marx .
Wade explained to Billboard magazine : `` I just felt it was necessary to get a different vantage point .
I 've been writing songs since I was 15 , and usually I use my own personal experiences and life situations as kind of a canvas , and there are certain times where there 's not a lot of turbulence in your life .
I felt like I needed to get inspiration elsewhere . ''
Wade expanded on this collaboration with Chris Daughtry , whom he met and became friends with on the road : `` I have n't done much co-writing in the past and I 'm a bit leery of it , '' he admitted .
`` You can end up with a song that is not good and just wish you had that day of your life back -LRB- laughs -RRB- however , I went over to Chris 's place in LA and within an hour we had ` Had Enough . ' ''
Chris Daughtry also sings backing vocals on this track .
