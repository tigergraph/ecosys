This was the first single from Springsteen 's album Magic , which was his first with the E-Street Band in 5 years .
The song deals with the search for energy and passion in life - what Springsteen refers to as `` Soul . ''
It 's a common Springsteen theme , especially at his concerts where he implores the crowd to live in the moment .
The line , `` Is there anybody out there '' is something he 's said at live shows to get a response from the crowd .
Springsteen -LRB- from Rolling Stone magazine , November 1 , 2007 -RRB- : `` It 's an end-of-the-world scenario - he 's seeing the apocalypse .
All communications are down .
That 's my business , that 's what it 's all about - trying to connect to you .
It comes down to trying to make people happy , feel less lonely , but also being a conduit for a dialogue about the events of the day , the issues that impact people 's lives , personal and social and political and religious .
That 's how I always saw the job of our band . ''
This song references `` Mystery Train , '' a hit for Elvis Presley , who Springsteen looks up to as an artist .
