Written by Kyuss guitarist Josh Homme , this song is about the life , pains , and lust that come from being a prostitute .
It preceded the popular Hip-Hop song with the same title by 7 years .
Nick Olivieri was the bass player for Kyuss at this time .
He and Homme , along with drummer Alfredo Hern√°ndez -LRB- who joined the band in 1994 -RRB- , formed Queens Of The Stone Age in 1997 .
When they named their new band , they did so with the intention of scaring off the homophobic fans they saw in their days with Kyuss .
-LRB- thanks , Brian - Winchester , MA , for above 2 -RRB-
