American Songwriter magazine asked Kimbra what track on Vows she is especially proud of .
She replied that she was , `` particularly excited by this song , '' as `` it was sort of my moment to get really indulgent musically , and throw in lots of key changes and interesting rhythmic moments . ''
Kimbra continued : `` Deantoni Parks from The Mars Volta played drums on that track and he 's a favorite drummer of mine so that was exciting to take the song into a bit of a ` prog ' territory .
I also feel it 's one of the more lyrically aggressive tracks on the record and has some really fun turnarounds and surprises . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Guy Franklin and shot across two days in late 2012 at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Parkville , Melbourne .
We see Kimbra as a mental patient , whom is under observation by concerned doctors and nurses .
Sydney-based stylist Cassandra Scott-Finn designed her white structured dress .
