This is a song about Karima Francis ' mother .
She told the Observer Music Monthly January 2009 : `` I wrote it when she was drinking .
I Ô¨Ånd it physically draining to sing , because it takes me back to that time .
I really find it hard , and it scares me to know that I 'm going to have to keep singing it . ''
