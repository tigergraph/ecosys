This song was written several years before it finally found its way onto a disc .
Gary Barlow explained on his his official website : `` We started work on this song on the Circus album .
Of course it did n't fit that album at all but we played what we had to Rob -LRB- Williams -RRB- and he loved it .
It was in the running to be on Progress too but again we never agreed on the final lyric until we revisited it for Progressed .
I think the drums and guitars even made it from the first incarnation 3 years ago ! ''
