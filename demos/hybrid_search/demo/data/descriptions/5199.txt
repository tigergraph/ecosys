This pumping anthem to hot females was released as the first international and third American single from R&B singer-songwriter Usher 's sixth studio album , Raymond Vs Raymond .
It features the song 's writer/producer Will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas .
This was Usher 's fourth # 1 single in the UK and his first since `` Burn '' in 2004 .
The song 's ascension to the # 1 position meant that Usher became the first artist to top the Hot 100 in the in the 90s , 00s and 10s .
Only Madonna and Janet Jackson accomplished the three-decade achievement in the 80s , 90s and 00s .
Will.i.am broke down his hit-making strategy for MTV 's The Seven .
`` We call it ` A-B-ing . '
Anything you make , there 's nothing new under the sun .
So there 's always an ' A and B ' to whatever your approach is , '' he said of producing smash hits for the likes of Usher .
`` So if you want a song to be a big # 1 smash , then you have to play a Michael Jackson song while you 're making your song . ''
Usher was accused of borrowing the song 's hook from a tune used in the 2003 The Simpsons ' episode , titled `` Dude , Where 's My Ranch ? ''
On `` OMG , '' the R&B star sings , `` Honey got a booty like pow , pow , pow / Honey got some boobies like wow , oh wow . ''
Meanwhile on the long-running animated show Homer Simpson belts out his own home made carol , singing , `` Christmas in December , wow , wow , wow / Give me tons of presents , now , now , now . ''
It was a DJs at Jackson , Mississippi radio station Y101 .7 who unearthed the connection and they created a video comparing the two lyrics , leading to leading to online fans speculating whether Usher based his chart hit on The Simpsons song .
Usher and Will.i.am shot the video on the weekend of March 6th and 7th with director Anthony Mandler in Los Angeles .
Mandler told Rap-Up .
com about the clip : `` Let 's just say that the video is a spectacle .
It really emphasizes what we love about Usher and the character and the icon that he is , and most importantly , it 's really a video that showcases his superstardom . ''
This was Usher 's ninth # 1 on the Hot 100 .
In the period between the singer 's first chart-topper during Valentine 's Day week 1998 with `` Nice & Slow , '' and this song 's ascension to peak position , no other artist has outpaced Usher 's production of # 1 singles .
Mariah Carey and Rihanna had the second-most chart-toppers in that time span with six each .
Usher and Will.I.Am shot the Anthony Mandler directed video on the weekend of March 6 , 2010 .
Usher told MTV News about his original concept for the clip .
`` We wanted to bring Will.I.Am into my world .
Obviously , the international sound and look and feel has already been set , but we wanted to do something theatrical , fun and energetic to show us working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists , but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible .
`` Mandler 's inspiration was Max Headroom , an animated science-fiction character from '80s British TV .
`` The original idea was kind of Max Headroom , '' said the director .
`` That 's where it came from -- the TV flickering on and there 's this character .
We just wanted to bring it up to date .
`` He added that the key to the clip was simply letting Usher 's talent take over .
`` The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where he does what I think he does better than anyone else in the world , which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us , the viewer , whether audible or visually , on a journey , not a ride .
And , in that , I wanted to create an unpredictability , so one set leads to another and another , and you never know what 's gon na happen .
Along the way , Usher becomes our guide .
We 're so focused on him , we do n't notice the change .
The thing is unfolding little by little , and you ca n't quite see far enough ahead to know what 's gon na come next . ''
The tune topped MTV 's Best Songs of 2010 list .
Runner up was Kanye West 's `` Runaway , '' and in third place came another West track , `` Power . ''
