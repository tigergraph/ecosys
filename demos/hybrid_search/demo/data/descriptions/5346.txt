This moderately paced love song adds to the ebb and flow of Disarm the Descent .
Frontman Jesse Leach told Artist Direct that 's why it was included on the album .
`` Initially , a couple of the guys were like , ' I do n't know if this fits on the record , ' '' he said .
`` Adam -LRB- Dutkiewicz , guitar -RRB- and I were like , ` well , it 's perfect because it gives a breather right before the last song . '
Every song is put in that particular order for a reason .
In a day and age where people do n't necessarily listen to records from start-to-finish , we 're still an album band , and we wanted to make sure this album was an experience from beginning-to-end .
I feel like ` Always ' was the breather before the final song .
It 's sort of the closer . ''
Disarm the Descent was Killswitch 's first album with Jesse Leach on vocals since 2002 's Alive or Just Breathing .
Leach explained to Artist Direct the album title is `` a creative way of saying ` Redemption ' or rising again .
You 're in a state of your life where you 're approaching rock bottom and you find a way to pick yourself up again before you hit the floor . ''
Leach added that bassist Mike D'Antonio came up with title as a reference to his return to the band .
`` That 's initially what Mike had in mind , '' said the vocalist .
`` He felt like that 's where we were all at .
I took it and ran with it .
It 's not just about the band .
It 's about the state of the world .
I 'm writing lyrics about people in my life and family and friends so the subject matter is really broad .
I tried my best to be ambiguous enough for people to draw their own conclusions in terms of what the lyrics are about .
I feel like I was able to do it in a way where it 's still cohesive . ''
Guitarist Joel Stroetzel described this to Pop-Break .
com as , `` a sludgy ballad song , which is also fun to play . ''
