This is a tribute to the Country singer Tammy Wynette , best known for her late '60s hit `` Stand By Your Man . ''
The Jimmy Ritchey , Don Poythress and Leslie Satcher penned song nearly did n't make it onto 100 Proof as Pickler was aware that the current generation did n't grow up on the '60s and '70s Nashville legend .
She told The Boot : `` After they hear it - the ones that say , ` Who 's Tammy Wynette ? '
- I hope they go and look her up .
That 's my goal with this song : I want this generation to know her and appreciate her style of music like I do . ''
