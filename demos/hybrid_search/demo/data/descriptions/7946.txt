Despite clocking in at 4:09 , this is the shortest track on alternative rock band The Horrors ' third album Skying .
The brass comes from several different sources including a six piece section led by trumpeter Derek Watkins , who once played with The Beatles .
Cowan explained to The Quietus : `` Some of it is sampled , some of it is live , and some of it is on mellotron .
It was just a real mishmash of stuff .
The live stuff was great .
It was great to see if we could do it .
We had some of the world 's finest trumpet players playing parts we 'd been playing on keyboards . ''
The song features a cracked-sounding brass refrain , which repeats several times , sometimes becoming percussive .
Synth player Tom Cowan told The Quietus , `` We did talk about brass .
But listening to hip hop , I really like hearing really great brass samples that are really simple .
I never liked brass when it was really in your face and over the top , but there 's a tasteful way of doing it , and that 's on a few tracks actually , but it has a very emotive sound .
It 's close to singing .
`` Guitarist Joshua Hayward added : `` I remember bringing in loads of things like hip hop with brass and saying ` Tom , this would be great on guitar . '
He said ` Yeah , you need to learn to play a brass instrument . ' ''
