Hot Hot Heat employed an experimental method of recording for their 2010 album , Future Breeds .
For this song they integrated an improvised sax solo from a homeless busker .
Singer Steve Bays explained to Spinner UK : `` Paul -LRB- Hawley -RRB- wrote this awesome guitar riff -LSB- for ` Zero Results ' -RSB- , but we could n't figure out how to make it work , '' he recounted .
`` Then one day we were listening to the riff on a loop and we heard this guy busking outside on his saxophone , and he just so happened to be playing in the same key as the song .
It just sounded so perfect that we had to invite him to come play in the studio.We ended up smoking a ton of pot with this homeless guy and recorded him playing through four different microphones set up throughout the room .
The next day I spent about eight hours cutting it up and treating it more like a collage than a solo .
I think it 's probably my favourite part on the record . ''
