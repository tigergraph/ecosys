This is a biographical song about the Newman family .
Newman was born in Los Angeles on November 28 , 1943 .
It is evident from the lyrics that his grandparents were Orthodox Jews who were trying to throw off their Jewishness and live the American Dream .
In the song , his mother leaves Los Angeles bound for New Orleans where her family lived , on the Dixie Flyer , which was a train that traveled from the midwest to Florida .
