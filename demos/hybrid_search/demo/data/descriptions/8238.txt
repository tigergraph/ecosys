`` Faaip De Oiad '' means `` Voice of God '' in the Enochian language .
The Enochian language was invented by Edward Kelley in the 16th Century .
Kelley said this language had been revealed to him by angels .
The Art Bell Show , a Nevada-based radio show that purported to discuss conspiracy theories and the paranormal , was the venue for a strange occurrence on September 11 , 1997 .
During an Area 51-themed call-in program , a hysterical man claiming to be a former Area 51 worker called in to warn Bell 's listening audience that he knew of a series of impending disasters .
This is the source of the monologue on this track .
Before the man was finished speaking , the Art Bell show mysteriously left the airwaves for about 30 minutes .
Several weeks later , the man called back apologizing for the -LRB- apparent -RRB- hoax , but the mysterious and somewhat coincidental outage has never been adequately explained .
-LRB- thanks , Matt - pitts , PA , for above 2 -RRB-
