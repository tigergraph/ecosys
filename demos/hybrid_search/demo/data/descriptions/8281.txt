This is a track from jazz-pop Canadian singer Nikki Yanofsky 's self-titled debut studio album , which she released at the age of 16 .
The record combines standards and originals that Yanofsky co-wrote with songwriters Jesse Harris and Ron Sexsmith .
Yanofsky told the Associated Press that each track she co-wrote reveals a little bit about herself .
She explained : `` Every song kind of opens up a tiny little crack into who I am , like ` Never Make It on Time , ' because I 'm always late .
And I was late going into the studio to record it and Jesse texted me , ` You never make it on time , ' and I 'm like , at least we have a song about it . ''
Yanofsky told The Associated Press that the trio secluded themselves in the basement of her family 's Montreal home writing .
`` An hour goes by , two hours goes by and you forget to eat because you 're so consumed with writing , '' she said .
`` So my mom would just knock on the door and like , bring us cookies and water . ''
