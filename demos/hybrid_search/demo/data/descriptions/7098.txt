This piece of psychedelic flamenco was penned by Weller with Ocean Colour Scene 's Steve Craddock , who also plays guitar .
Weller explained to Mojo magazine that his initial inspiration for the song was the expressive jazz of John Coltrane .
For years Weller had loved the idea of Coltrane , but struggled to find an entry point .
`` I had ' A Love Supreme ' and listened to it a few times over the course of maybe 20 years , '' said Weller .
`` Then one day - not too long , really - it just hit me . ''
`` The jumping-off point there was -LRB- Coltrane 's 1962 track -RRB- Ole , '' he added .
`` There are things you can take from great music and apply them to something new .
They might not even be detectable by the time you 've finished the song , but you know they 're there .
I already had the lyrics for Drifters , so the idea was to try and sing them across the bar lines , outside of a time frame . ''
