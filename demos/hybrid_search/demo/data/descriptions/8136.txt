This song finds vocalist Michael Barnes singing about how all humans are attracted to what destroys us .
Guitarist Anthony Armstrong told Artist Direct : `` This track is about leveling the field .
Regardless if we are believers in a higher power or not , the bottom line is that we are all infected with falling short as human beings .
`` He added : `` Much like ` Die For You ' , this track stared off with a programmed beat that just felt great and the song was literally birthed from that . ''
