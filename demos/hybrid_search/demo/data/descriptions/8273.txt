Fallen Empires is an album inspired by Snow Patrol frontman and chief songwriter Gary Lightbody 's childhood in Bangor , Northern Ireland .
He told The Sun how the record has delighted his family : `` My folks freaked out when they heard it - especially the song Lifening , which is about my dad .
I 've mentioned my mum a few times in songs but never my dad so he was very chuffed . ''
Lightbody explained the song 's meaning to Billboard magazine : `` It kinda boils down what is important in my life and I think it 's relatable in that the essence of what truly is important .
Family , friends , football and music for me .
Trying to remove yourself from what does n't matter . ''
Lightbody lists the things he most desires from life in this song , which include `` to share what I 've given , some kids eventually . ''
`` That song is really about the line , ` to be a father like my dad ' , '' he told The Guardian .
`` That 's probably the most personal thing I 've ever written .
I want kids for sure .
I was n't sure men had biological clocks , but I can hear mine so f -- ing loudly , it 's right behind my eyes .
But they rarely let single guys in rock bands adopt , and that 's not actually a bad policy , is it ?
I know that my moral compass is still spinning randomly , but I want to rediscover the playfulness and innocence I had as a kid .
That time when I could just round around , covered in mud , laughing out loud and not giving a s -- t about anything . ''
