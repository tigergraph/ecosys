Following the success of `` Wicked Game , '' Chris Isaak released a compilation album in 1991 , which he followed with San Fransisco Days .
This was the album 's first single , and it was a modest hit , though it got some air time on VH-1 and is fondly remembered by fans .
It 's about a man who stumbles into an affair with a woman he probably should n't be with , but neither have the strength or control to stay away from each other .

Isaak 's videos for `` Wicked Game '' and `` Baby Did a Bad , Bad Thing '' were equally provocative .
