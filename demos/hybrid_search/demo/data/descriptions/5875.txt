This is about a vow that 2 people take when they fall in love and commit to each other .
The song talks about a church , and how it is not made of flashy or glamorous objects , but of love : `` Its commandments are of consolation and warmth . ''
The chorus discusses how their sacrament will never fail ; his sacrament is her .
In the second verse he talks about how his prayers are not enough to heal his pain , and that this world has led her to believe the wrong things in life .
