Alternative rock band Jack 's Mannequin 's third studio album , People and Things is considered by frontman Andrew McMahon to be a `` relationship record . ''
He explained : `` My goal with many of the songs was to strip away the flowery language and sentiment attached to newer love and replace it with starker , less blinded language about more binding love .
In the time following the last Jack 's album the people in my world were moving in together , getting married , trying to find ` real jobs ' and reconciling new lives that looked a lot less like youth than some of us cared for . ''
It was this song which led to the theme running throughout the record .
Said McMahon : `` Marriage is a bit of a beast to tackle in a pop record but when I wrote ` My Racing Thoughts , ' it became clear how powerful and loaded a subject this kind of love is and somewhere in that moment I began to lock into the broad concept for the writing sessions to come . ''
The song was released as a single on August 2 , 2011 .
