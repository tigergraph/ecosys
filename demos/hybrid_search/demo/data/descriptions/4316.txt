Singer Josh Francesci revealed to This is Fake DIY that the band wanted to name their album after this song , but were denied by their record label .
He explained : `` We wanted to call the album ` Little Death ' but our label and our management would n't let us because it actually means ` orgasm ' in French , and they were n't into that .
Then , our producer Garth Richardson actually said that when we said that title , it made him think of his daughter , who 's only fourteen , being abducted and killed and we did n't really think that was good , if that 's what parents thought about it . ''
The song was inspired by the sudden death of drummer Daniel Flint 's father .
Francesci explained to The Independent : `` When it happened , it was a shock for everyone .
That 's why in ` Little Death ' I say ` f -- k what you believe in ' , because people say dumb s -- t like ` it was his time ' .
It has nothing to do with religion , a good man passed away for no reason .
I hate people trying to make a reason for it .
I like to think they 're watching over us and looking after our fortune and bringing us good luck when we need it . ''
