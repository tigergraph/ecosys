This is probably the only song to reference both a classic 19th century novel -LRB- Emily Bronte 's Wuthering Heights -RRB- and a Pop song by a 1980s one hit wonder -LRB- `` Safety Dance '' by Men Without Hats -RRB- .
In the UK the song 's title was shortened to `` 10,000 Nights . ''
This was Alphabeat 's first song to go to # 1 in their native Denmark .
