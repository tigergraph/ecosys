This song is a family affair , deriving its dreamlike sensibility from the ethereal vocals of Neil Finn 's wife , Sharon Dawn Johnson .
The song 's coda benefits from the psychedelic guitar work of Liam Finn , Neil 's son and long-time collaborator in the studio and onstage .
Finn told Spinner UK about his wife 's contribution to this song : `` She 's done some aaaahs and oohs and various things in the past and I 've always known she had a lovely tone in her voice , but it was Jim Scott 's idea that the song Isolation might take a woman 's voice in the second verse , that juxtaposition .
And we tried it with her , and I thought it sounded beautiful . ''
