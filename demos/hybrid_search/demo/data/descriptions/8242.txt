The View singer Kyle Falconer told the NMEthe story of this song : `` Kyle was visiting Drew McConnell -LRB- Babyshambles -RRB- after Which Bitch , he stays in a big house with loads of musicians and they were all getting together and jamming ideas , making techno tunes and loads of weird cuts .
Kyle just came up with a few lines during those sessions that stuck in his head and he wanted to bring them back to The View and try something with more groove than straight out rock 'n' roll .
Our keyboard player Darren wrote the middle eight and there a great ` Ibiza style ' remix of this track by the 2 Bears , which has quite a bit of airplay on dance shows . ''
