This song finds frontman Anthony Kiedis singing about a midlife crisis .
`` We all know and struggle with some loneliness , '' he croons .
The title is a turn on the phrase `` Misery Loves Company , '' as Kiedis points out that Happiness is also effected by the law of attraction .
`` Happiness '' is one of several tracks on I 'm With You that features Flea playing the piano , an instrument he 'd previously only tinkered with .
This came about through the RHCP bassist going to USC for a year during the band 's hiatus and studying music theory .
Part of his course work involved him playing the piano , which prompted him to start writing songs on the keyboard instrument .
