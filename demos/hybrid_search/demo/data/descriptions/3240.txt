Like Lawson 's debut single `` When She Was Mine , '' frontman Andy Brown penned this song about his split from The Saturday 's Mollie King .
The singer told Capital Radio how he penned the tune with bassist Ryan Fletcher after seeing photographs of Mollie with her next boyfriend , male supermodel David Gandy .
`` What happened was , we split up and I wrote quite a few songs about it , '' he explained .
`` It was hard because she just started going out with a ridiculously good-looking guy after me .
` When She Was Mine ' was a song about that , but ` Standing In The Dark ' was the first song -- I wrote it with Ryan on the day we saw her with this new guy in the paper and stuff .
It did hurt me hard . ''
The song 's music video sees Brown looking through a window as his former girlfriend romantically embraces her new love .
Brown 's ex is played by actress Nicole O'Neill who also featured in Labrinth 's `` Treatment '' as the ` Ghostly girl . '
This is the third single from Lawson 's debut album , Chapman Square .
Bassist Ryan Fletcher said in publicity materials announcing its release : '' ` Standing in the Dark ' has been our favourite song to perform live for such a long time .
Andy -LRB- Brown -RRB- and I wrote it whilst staying in a mate 's flat which was overlooking the O2 Arena a couple of years ago and getting the chance to perform it earlier this year at the arena itself was a definite highlight for us as a band . ''
Chapman Square is named after the London street where frontman Andy Brown once shared a flat with his then girlfriend , Mollie King of The Saturdays .
Drummer Adam Pitts explained : `` We used to crash and write songs there all the time .
It 's where Andy was living with his girlfriend at the time , who a number of the songs on the album were actually written about . ''
