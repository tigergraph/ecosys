Billy Currington originally wrote this five years prior to the recording of Little Bit of Everything , together with a friend of his , Brett Jones .
It was originally intended to be included on his 2005 album Doin ' Somethin' Right but he `` just did n't want to ` love ' that one up too much . ''
Currington added that he believed this to be a stand-out track on Little Bit of Everything .
He explained to AOL : `` To me , this song , as a writer , is by far probably my best piece of work .
The best lyrically .
And I think it has a great melody , and it was one of the songs I started playing acoustically in many different places , whether it be on the bus , or at a show somewhere , and it just seemed to always go over well , and as time went on people started requesting that song , and I knew it was something special .
I did n't know when it was going to make it onto an album , so when this one came up here , I made sure there was no way it was not going to make it onto the album .
I feel like it 's a great recording , and I 'm very proud of it . ''
