On this track Jeezy raps about visiting one of his good friends in prison .
He explained to MTV News why this is one of the tracks on the album that means the most to him .
Said Jeezy : `` You see this person that had all these things , and he 's in a position where he does n't have any control over all of that .
It 's like a sense of pride .
When you walking into the building to see him , you 're -LSB- thinking about -RSB- how he 's gon na be reacting , how he 's gon na feel .
It 's a hard feeling , but I think it was a harder feeling for me than it was for him .
I was like , ` Whoa . '
He was like , ` What 's up ?
So how 's the club going ?
Who 's doing what ? '
I was on the free side , and I still felt awkward .
But that 's my man , though .
To see him stand up there like , ` I 'm cool .
You all right ? '
He was like , ' I see you riding with Barack . '
Everybody had to go see somebody who they loved at a funeral or either a prison - it 's nothing you can do .
That 's your song .
I been to so many funerals .
I 'm like , ` Man , I ca n't go again . '
But you have to go .
That 's the song to get you through . ''
This samples Willie Hutch 's `` Overture of Foxy Brown '' from the soundtrack for the 1975 movie Foxy Brown .
