Martina McBride is well known for her powerhouse vocals .
The singer told CMT News why she did n't sing this song , which consists of a conversation between an alcoholic man and his woman , who still believes in him , at full volume .
She explained : `` It 's a very intimate conversation , so it needs to be what you would say when two people are in a room .
It needs to be intimate .
I try to find what fits the song .
Sometimes the only way I can really reach those notes is to belt it , so it 's just however it comes out . ''
