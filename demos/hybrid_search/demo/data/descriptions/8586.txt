Bombay Bicycle Club is an alternative rock band from North London , who were formed by vocalist Jack Steadman , guitarist Jamie MacColl , and drummer Suren de Saram under the name of The Canals when they were 15 .
Bassist Ed Nash later joined them as they switched between various aliases before picking Bombay Bicycle Club , after a chain of Indian restaurants in London .
Vocalist and chief songwriter Jack Steadman wrote this song in the early days of the band .
He told NME : `` I made this when I was about 15 , with a hip-hop beat and a sample of a baby crying .
It was terrible .
But I started fiddling with it , took away the baby and gave it that marching band beat . ''
