After Contemporary Christian musician Jeremy Camp had almost finished recording his seventh studio album , We Cry Out : The Worship Project , the singer 's brother-in-law , Brad Peens , showed him an idea for a song that included an African choir .
Camp came up with a few ideas of his own and the pair re-wrote it together .
`` It 's very anthemic , a worldwide kind of song , '' he told TheWorshipCommunity.com adding , `` It feels like a war song , a cry of God 's glory . ''
We Cry Out : The Worship Project was released on August 24 , 2010 , and peaked at # 1 on the Billboard Christian Albums Charts .
This song was released as a single the following year and it proved to be one of Camp 's most successful releases topping the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart .
