This mostly instrumental song finds August Burns Red blending bongos , cello , Chinese harp , marimba , trumpet and violin into their musical arsenal .
Guitarist and principal songwriter JB Brubaker told The Alternative Press : `` Every once and a while , we like to write songs that are completely off the wall .
`` Creative Captivity '' is an example of this .
I have a feeling this will be either a ` love it or hate it ' track for a lot of people . ''
Brubaker explained the meaning behind the album title : `` Rescue & Restore is about challenging other bands and ourselves , as well as fans of this music , to want more than whatever happens to be the current buzz , '' he said .
`` We 've done our best with each new album to try to push our sound in new directions and we 'd like to see our peers do the same . ''
`` People need to realize that there 's not much of a difference between a metalcore song that has a couple breakdowns with a repeating chorus and the latest Lady Gaga song .
This genre used to be better than that .
It can still be better than that . ''
The song turns a critical eye to the Metalcore genre , as August Burns Red attempt to prove by example that bands can still find exciting new ways to expand the genre .
Brubaker explained to Alternative Press : `` It is about how boring our genre has become and how we all need to try hard to break out of the slump that is currently plaguing Metalcore . ''
