This angst-ridden track was produced by Just Blaze and features rapper Lil Wayne .
The two MCs previously worked together with Drake and Kanye West on the single `` Forever '' and as a pair on Weezy 's `` Drop The World . ''
However , this is the first instance of the duo trading rhymes on the same song .
Eminem told Billboard magazine : `` I did a song with Wayne called ` Drop the World for his album and we had just agreed to do an even swap , so I wanted him on my album .
I kind of waited , and when -LSB- producer -RSB- Just Blaze had finished that beat we jumped on it . ''
The song contains a sample of `` What Is Love '' by Trinidadian Eurodance musician Haddaway .
The song 's music video was directed by Chris Robinson , who previously collaborated with the pair on the `` Drop The World '' clip .
It shows a kid being picked on by three bullies at his school , who eventually stands up to them .
Eminem told DJ Whoo Kid his own Shade 45 satellite radio station that it was easy to link that topic with the song 's lyrics .
`` As far as conceptually with the video , we felt like that 's kind of what the song was saying -- kicking somebody when they 're down or somebody being bullied or picking on somebody , '' he explained .
`` So we kind of just came up with that concept and went with it for the video . ''
