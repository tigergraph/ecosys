This song refers to Sean Bell , who on November 25 , 2006 was shot dead by NYPD officers on the morning of his wedding day .
This understandably provoked much criticism of the police and three of the detectives in question went to trial but were found not guilty of all charges .
Yayo added in an interview with The Village Voice : `` Matter of fact , I think G-Unit is number one in the Hip-Hop police book .
We definitely on the radar .
Banks and them got arrested at Madison Square Garden , leaving the Garden .
We 've been pulled over and harassed , but it is what it is .
The police just shot Sean Bell fifty times , and they got a not-guilty verdict .
That 's why we got a tribute on our album called `` Straight Outta Southside , '' a tribute to Sean Bell .
So rest in peace to him and shout out to his family . ''
Tony Yayo told MTV News that this his favorite track off the album .
He said : `` My favorite , hands down , is ` Straight Outta Southside . '
Rest in peace to Sean Bell .
It 's a tribute to him .
It starts off the album .
It 's real aggressive . ''
This features elements from N.W.A. 's 1988 track `` Straight Outta Compton . ''
