Gene Simmons explained the meaning of this bludgeoning track to Billboard magazine : `` A lot of the lyrics and points of view have less to do with sort of the cocksmanship , craftsmanship - ` Hey babe , I 'm gon na rock you all night long , ' and are more about sort of primal notions about who we are and how we feel , '' he said .
`` So something like ` The Devil is Me , ' for instance , is more confessional ; you can keep pointing your fingers at all the evil in the world , but you 've got some of it and here 's the Lord 's decree -- the devil is me .
Maybe there 's a little devil in all of us . ''
