When you work with your girlfriend , sometimes you find yourself doing things your way and then asking for forgiveness later .
That 's what interview with Joshua Scott Jones of Steel Magnolia told us about creating songs with Meghan Linsey .
And `` Without You '' is and example .
Said Jones : `` I started that one when I came home real late one night , or early , probably ... actually .
It was in the middle of a fight and I thought I 'd lost everything that we 'd worked on .
So that 's where that song started , the genesis of that song , the verses .
And then I kind of stole the chorus from a song that I 'd written with Meghan and Van Preston , and I inserted the chorus of that song into the verses of ` Without You . '
And I just asked for forgiveness later . ''
