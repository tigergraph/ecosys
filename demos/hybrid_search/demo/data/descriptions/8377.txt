Cancer Bats are one of the hardest working bands in the music industry , spending close to 300 days away from home in 2011 .
Frontman Liam Cormier told Terrorizer magazine that though this song is about his own struggles with the hardships that come with a career spent on the road , he hopes others will relate to the song 's sentiments about being away from loved ones .
He explained : '' ` Road Sick ' is my one tour song that I still have on the album , but trying to change up .
I mean as we 've been on tour for six years , it 's like now I 'm not really trying to glamorize it , it 's trying to look at the other side of it.My big thing with this one too though was I did n't necessarily wan na write this specifically for myself .
When I meet people at shows , and talk to people , a lot of people come up to me and tell me they appreciate all the songs like ` Lucifer 's Rocking Chair ' and the big one is guys who are in the army will tell me how they listen to ` Hail Destroyer ' while they 're in Afghanistan and traveling .
So it 's like my song for all of us , obviously the verses and stuff are specific about me but just the idea of being away from the ones you love , you 're just trying to get through and work as hard as you can.Even as I say in the chorus , it was n't exactly what you planned but you 're doing your best with what you 've got .
I meet guys who have one foot and they 're with their wife and they 're like `` you know what , I never planned on going there and getting my foot blown off but man I listened to ` Hail Destroyer ' every day while I was there '' and I 'm just like `` holy s -- t ! '' .
So that song was about tour but also about all those people that I know that can relate to tour songs just as much , if not more . ''
