During an interview for VH1 's Heavy : The Story of Metal , Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio stated that the song is about each human being 's ability to choose between doing good and doing evil , essentially that each person has `` heaven and hell '' inside themselves .
Dio said it was one of his favorites .
-LRB- thanks , Neil - Conroe , TX -RRB- The Christian metal band Stryper surprised some of their fans by recording a version of this song for their 2011 covers album , The Covering .
However , frontman Michael Sweet told Rock Confidential they should give the lyrics a listen before condemning the music .
Said the singer : `` There were some songs we were thinking about and decided we probably should n't .
There were some Ozzy songs , some Maiden songs , some Priest songs .
We tried our best to be appropriate with the lyrical choices .
Some may argue , ` How can they justify doing a Sabbath song ? '
If you read the words to ` Heaven and Hell , ' those are lyrics that Stryper would 've written .
There 's nothing wrong with those lyrics .
They 're absolutely dead-on the money . ''
The song was parodied by Tenacious D in Dio 's music video for `` Push . ''
In the video Jack Black and Kyle Gass are playing the song on a sidewalk with modified lyrics about marijuana when Dio approaches and offers them money to play one of their songs .
