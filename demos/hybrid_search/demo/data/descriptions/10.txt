Miike Snow is an indie pop band formed in 2007 .
The band consists of American vocalist Andrew Wyatt and Swedish producing team Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg , who under the guise of Bloodshy and Avant have worked with Britney Spears , Kylie Minogue and Madonna .
The trio named themselves after a friend of the band called Mike Snow , with the extra ` i ' of `` Miike '' coming from the Japanese film director Takashi Miike .
This is a track from their second album , Happy To You , which is titled after an old computer that Karlsson found in Thailand .
Winnberg told The Sun about the genesis of this '90s piano-led House tune : `` We were messing about with piano chords that gave us the start of The Devil 's Work , '' he explained .
`` It reminded us of that old school dance feel .
Hands in the air , ready to dance . ''
