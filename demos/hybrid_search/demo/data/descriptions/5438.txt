Kanye West told concreteloop.com how the lyrical inspiration for this song came from a higher place : `` Like on this one , I did n't even try , I just zoned out , I 'd go into the studio and vibe to the beat and just -LSB- he starts to rap some of `` Flashing Lights '' -RSB- and it came and God gave me the words . ''
The lyrics , `` Like Martin with no Gina '' are a reference to the '90s TV show Martin , where the characters Martin and Gina -LRB- played by Tisha Campbell -RRB- were a couple .
`` Flashing Lights '' features vocals from R&B and soul singer Dwele and Connie Mitchell .
The latter is lead singer of the Australian dance act Sneaky Sound System , and is featured on four of Graduation 's tracks .
Sneaky Sound System producer Black Angus told The Sun February 27 , 2009 , that it was he who suggested Connie Mitchell to West when he was out having dinner with him one night .
He explained : `` Kanye was sat there sipping tea like it was soup , with a teaspoon .
He was working in the studio for three weeks but was struggling for inspiration .
I told him he should meet our singer as she is amazing .
The next day we got a call so told Connie to get down to the studio in her prettiest dress and to sing .
`` Connie Mitchell added with a smile : `` The boys were pimping me !
But it was an amazing experience and I got to know his late mother , who was lovely .
She raised a good boy . ''
Unusually for West this song contains no credited samples .
