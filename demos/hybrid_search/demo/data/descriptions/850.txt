This cover of Foreigner 's 1984 Hot 100 # 1 hit is the second single from Mariah Carey 's twelfth studio album , Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel .
Other early '80s tracks Carey has covered include Journey 's `` Open Arms , '' Def Leppard 's `` Bringin ' on the Heartbreak '' and Phil Collins ' `` Against All Odds -LRB- Take A Look At Me Now -RRB- . ''
Long-time collaborator Big Jim Wright , along with Christopher `` Tricky '' Stewart , produced this song .
Carey told MTV News about Wright 's contribution to Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel : `` I worked with Big Jim Wright , who works with Sounds of Blackness a lot , and so there 's live-feeling songs on the album .
A lot of my fans , since I 've been twittering , a lot of the fans are like , ` We want some live-sounding stuff , ' so you have to find that middle ground . ''
