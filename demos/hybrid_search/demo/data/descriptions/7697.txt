Moore penned this party anthem with his producer Jeremy Stover and country songwriter Rhett Akins -LRB- `` All About Tonight , '' `` The Shape I 'm In , '' `` Farmer 's Daughter '' -RRB- .
He told the Charlotte radio station WSOC : '' ` Beer Time ' is just a fun party redneck song , it 's one of those get crazy and have a good time , crank it up songs .
It 's a whole lot of fun to perform live . ''
Moore references Hank Williams Jr. when he sings , `` Hearin ' Hank play live .
Country boy can survive .
I need something cold when the show ends . ''
It 's not the first time Moore has referred to the country singer-songwriter , and its something that he has been criticized for .
He told American Songwriter magazine : `` Somebody gave me crap about that in an interview or something .
It was when the new album came out .
I referenced him in ` Beer Time . '
I said , ` Well , I really did that .
I saved my money to buy Hank Jr. tickets , and it was in the top row , it seemed like , of the arena .
I really did that .
So to you it may come across as clich√© and crappy writing , but to me it 's real . '
Really , honestly , that 's all I care about is if I like it and I 'm proud of it as a songwriter and an artist , and if my fans like it .
And they do . ''
