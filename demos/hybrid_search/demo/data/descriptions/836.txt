They put most of it together while they were touring together in 1969 ; Clapton with Blind Faith , and The Bramletts supporting them with their group Delaney And Bonnie .
Blind Faith broke up after their first tour , and Clapton formed Derek and the Dominos with Delaney And Bonnie 's backup group , who Clapton became friends with on the tour .
The members of Derek and the Dominos , as well as Stephen Stills , were Clapton 's band on his first album .
The drummer was Jim Gordon , who wrote the piano part of `` Layla '' and later suffered terrible mental illness and bludgeoned his mother to death .
