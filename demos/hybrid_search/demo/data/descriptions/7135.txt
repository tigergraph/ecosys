Lead singer Jehnny Beth described this taunting one night stand song 's meaning to NME as being about , `` the sense that we 've very dispersed as people .
We 're becoming like smoke , almost : we 're not touched by things anymore . ''
The song was named after a grim 1970 John Cassavetes film which tells the story of three middle class men in the throes of a midlife crisis .
The song is a new recording of The Savage 's debut single `` Husbands '' b/w `` Flying To Berlin , '' which was released on Jehnny Beth 's record label Pop Noire in June 2012 .
