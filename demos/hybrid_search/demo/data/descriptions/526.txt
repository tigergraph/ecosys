Craig Morgan closes his sixth album , This Ole Boy , with this memory of some summer lovin ' under the stars and moon .
He told Yahoo !
Music : `` Just a fun , simple , easy listening , sittin ' on the creek bank kind of song .
And that 's what that 's all about .
A lot of that came from real-life experiences . ''
