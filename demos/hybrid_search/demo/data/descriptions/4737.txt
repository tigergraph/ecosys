This track and the rest of the album was produced by Emmylou Harris ' ex-husband Brian Ahern , the man behind her classic '70s albums such as Pieces Of the Sky and Elite Hotel .
It was their first album together for 25 years .
Harris explained to The Sun June 6 , 2008 : `` We 'd done one-off projects over the years since our big split-up .
This album kinda just happened .
He lives five minutes from me and I wanted to stay at home to do it . ''
All I Intended to Be became Harris ' highest-charting solo set on the Top Country Album list in 28 years .
`` It 's # 4 placing was Harris ' best solo showing since Roses in the Snow spent five weeks at # 2 in 1980 .
Brian Ahern originally recorded this evocation of the rites of passage , with Nashville singer Karen Brooks in 1982 .
Emmylou Harris had wanted to cover it for a long time and when she finally did so she told The Sun that it became `` the springboard for everything else '' on the album .
