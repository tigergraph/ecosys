Codeine Velvet Club is a collaboration between The Fratellis lead vocalist Jon Fratelli and Glasgow singer Lou Hickey .
This is the first single from their self-titled debut album .
Fratelli explained to The Sunday Mail August 23 , 2009 : `` Lou was making an album and I had known her for a little while .
She asked if I had anything she could maybe use and I had part of the song Vanity Kills .
I gave it to her and , two days later , she came back with words and a tune .
It was almost perfect from the get go .
It was meant to be for her but I could n't let it go .
We did it in two days so I wondered what else we could do - so we did a record , then thought we 'd put a band together . ''
Fratelli told The Sunday Mail about this tune : `` The song that started it all .
Again it sums us up .
I am singing a whole register lower because Lou 's voice is naturally higher .
I enjoyed it . ''
