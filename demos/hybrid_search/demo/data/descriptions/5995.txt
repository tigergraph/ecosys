This is a track from Welsh rock band Funeral for a Friend 's fifth studio album , Welcome Home Armageddon .
The line-up for the record comprised Matthew Davies-Kreye , guitarists Kris Coombs-Roberts and Gavin Burrough , drummer Ryan Richards and bassist Richard Boucher .
The record was Funeral for a Friend 's first long player to feature Ryan Richard 's former bandmate in Honda Maclean , guitarist Gavin Burrough , who originally joined the band in September 2008 as a bass player .
Ryan Richards discussed Burrough 's contribution to this track in an interview with Rock Sound magazine : `` This song was actually the first idea Gav brought to the table after joining the band , and I think he made it obvious to us what we had been missing for the last few records - RIFFS !
Gav has definitely reawakened the guitar demon within Kris , and I think this song was the catalyst for that .
It was the first heavier song I 'd written with Gav for about eight years -LRB- after leaving Hondo Maclean -RRB- and we locked in straight away again , which you can hear on the intro and the verse .
It 's quite reminiscent of the way we used to lock the guitars and drums together in our old band and Matt 's done a great job of getting the melody in there over it . ''
