This reggae-flavored track features the Rolling Stones ' Keith Richards on guitar .
Crow and the Stones go back a long way .
She has performed with the British rock group in concert , sung duets with Mick Jagger , and Richards previously appeared on Crow 's 1999 Sheryl Crow and Friends : Live from Central Park set .
When she came up with this track , there was only one guitarist she could imagine adding his signature slashing riffs to the mix , and Richards duly obliged .
`` He has been such a champion for me , and the Stones gave me so many breaks along the way , from very early on , '' she said .
Crow told Rolling Stone that Richards ' contribution was not the only way the Stones helped her with the making of 100 Miles From Memphis .
`` Writing the lyrics , it was like having a term paper hanging over my head , '' Crow explained .
`` But I saw the documentary of making Exile on Main Street , and there 's a scene where Mick has all these tunes that do n't have any lyrics , and it made me feel so much better .
That 's one of my favorite records of all time , and I figure , ` Well , if he had a suitcase full of songs he had to write lyrics for and it turned out that good , there 's some hope here . ' ''
