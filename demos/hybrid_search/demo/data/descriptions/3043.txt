Is This Desire ?
found Harvey switching from her earlier guitar-driven rock style into subtler , quieter , atmospheric soundscapes and mood pieces based around keyboards , bass and electronics .
There were reports that Harvey gave herself so completely to the record that it was detrimental to her health .
It was claimed that she was particularly unsettled by the dark , distorted missing girl narrative of `` My Beautiful Leah . ''
She told Q magazine April 2011 : `` I was aware that Is This Desire ?
was a very uncomfortable record .
But there was nothing else that was sounding like it and that really excited me .
I 'd never explored really debasing keyboards and drum equipment and loop and samples .
Really debasing my voice .
And -LRB- being -RRB- debasing lyrically .
Clawing things back into minimalism , very stark contrasts of light and shade .
Maybe at the time it was feeling like quite a gamble for me .
I 'm really glad I went through with it cos it 's something that I feel really proud of now . ''
