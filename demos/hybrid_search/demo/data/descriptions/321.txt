Marling sings of a crumbling relationship with a father figure lover accompanied just by her acoustic guitar .
The lyric of this sparse waltz is laden with guilt and recrimination .
`` You were my speaker/My innocence keeper . ''
The song is written in the form of a communication by Marling to her former beau .
She told The Independent : `` Someone told me a good writing tip is to write conversations with people you ca n't have conversations with , that it 's quite useful for developing characters .
I did that a lot while I was writing this album .
There 's of a lot of one-sided conversations in it . ''
