This is the first single from R&B singer Jamie Foxx 's fourth studio album , Best Night of My Life .
The song was produced by and features Justin Timberlake and has a guest spot from rapper T.I. Foxx and Timberlake anchored the `` Win or Go Home '' cinema marketing initiative for the 2010 NBA playoff promotional campaign , which coincided with this hoops-referencing song 's digital release .
Foxx said he hoped their collaboration will `` play throughout the NBA finals . ''
Foxx described working with Timberlake to talk show host George Lopez : `` I get into the studio , this dude produces three tracks for me .
It is absolutely crazy and I had to bow down .
The way I got him on the track -- 'cause he was n't gon na get on the track -- I just literally said , ` Man , my people suffered for 500 years .
You owe me this . ' ''
The track reunites Justin Timberlake and T.I. , who previously worked together on Tip 's hit `` Dead and Gone '' and Timberlake 's 2006 chart-topper `` My Love . ''
