This is the title track of British boyband JLS 's second album .
Marvin of the band explained to Digital Spy why they named the LP after this song : `` There 's a song on the album with that title , but we also thought it made for a great theme .
We asked fans for suggestions , and there were some really good ones , but in the end we thought Outta This World was the best because we could do something amazing with the artwork . ''
