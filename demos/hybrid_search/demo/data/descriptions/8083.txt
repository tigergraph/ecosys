This is a cover of a song by American country/folk singer-songwriter John Prine .
Lambert said , `` I was really nervous to record it the way we did , because I respect John Prine beyond belief .
But to me , if you 're going to cut somebody 's song , do n't do it just like they did it .
Put your own twist on and make it your yours .
We cut it `` crazy '' -- a little bit Miranda , a little bit country , a little bit punk .
That song was the most fun I 've ever had recording .
It sounds like we were having a party when we cut it , and believe me we were . ''
