This heartbreaking yet triumphant autobiographical tale is the title track of singer-songwriter Ashley Monroe 's sophomore album .
The song was the product of Ashley 's first writing session with Nashville legend Guy Clark .
`` I was trying to pitch him my best ideas , '' she recalled to Billboard magazine , `` and he just looked up at me , and said ` Tell me about you . '
So , I started to tell him about myself , about my dad dying , and told him all these things , and at the end , I said , ` But , look , I turned out like a rose . '
I do n't know why I said that , I guess it was a nervous way to wrap up my story .
He looked at me and said , ` Well , why do n't we just write that . ' ''
Vince Gill sings back up on the track .
The Country icon not only lent his vocal talents to the album , but also produced it .
Monroe explained how Gill helmed the record the old-fashioned way .
`` We just got the band in a circle and started playing the songs , '' she recalled , `` and once we felt like we had a feel for it , I 'd do my vocal live-I never went back in to do a second vocal .
Everyone put everything we had into the songs .
There was a buzz in the room .
We all had fun-it felt like a big old family , the way records used to be made . ''
Monroe told Billboard that every time she sings this son , she gets `` chills and start to cry , because it is so true . ''
The Nashville songstress added she believes that `` everyone has their story .
We all go through things .
You can do that .
You just enjoy all the adventures and the heartache , and it 's all worth it in the end . ''
The song is mainly based on Monroe 's own personal history - with a few embellishments .
`` A lot of that is autobiographical - I mean , I did n't run off with a boy to North Dakota like it says , but Guy likes putting North Dakota in songs , '' she said , with a laugh .
`` There are a few little inserts of over-exaggeration , but not many . ''
