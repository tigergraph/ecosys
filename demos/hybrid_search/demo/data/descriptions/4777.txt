Greek mythology recounts how Apollo was struck by the beauty of Cassandra , daughter of Priam , the King of Troy .
He promised Cassandra the gift of prophecy in return for her favors , but she rejected him afterwards .
Enraged , Apollo indeed gifted her with the ability to know the future , with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her .
None believed her prophecies of the fall of Troy and Cassandra was eventually captured at the sack of the city .
In 1949 French philosopher Gaston Bachelard coined the term `` Cassandra Complex '' to refer to a belief that things could be known in advance .
In psychology , the Cassandra Complex is applied to individuals who experience physical and emotional suffering as a result of distressing personal perceptions , but are disbelieved when they attempt to share the cause of their pain with others .
Emmy explained to The Guardian how the Cassandra Complex inspired this song : `` I pulled out some important-looking books about Jung at my local library , and ended up reading an idiot 's guide graphic novel .
There was a section called ` Cassandra complex . '
I 've always sympathised with Cassandra .
She had some bad luck .
And she was always right , like my mother .
I see her existing through the ages , in many situations . ''
