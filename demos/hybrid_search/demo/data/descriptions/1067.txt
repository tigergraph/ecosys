Speaking to Tim McMahan , Bright Eyes songwriter Conor Oberst said that `` Like most songs , it 's a composite sketch , a drawing from a lot of different experiences .
Some my own experiences and some from people close to me , stories I heard that affected me and entered my subconscious to find a place in a song . ''
Lime Tree closed Bright Eye 's 2007 release , Cassadega , and was notably downbeat on a record noted for it 's rollicking , adventurous sound .
While much of the music on the album moved into uncharted musical territory for the band , Lime Tree 's sound had come critics comparing it to previous work by the band , including `` Lua '' from 2005 's I 'm Wide Awake , It 's Morning .
The song discusses an abortion , using more straightforward lyrics than Oberst is generally prone to .
Lines like `` Since the operation I heard you 're breathing for one '' both make the subject explicit and add some thematic depth to the the song - ostensibly , the lyric could also be referring to the mother falling out of love with the father of the unborn child thanks to the stress of the procedure .
