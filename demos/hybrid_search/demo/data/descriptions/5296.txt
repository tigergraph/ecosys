This song is about the sexual assault of a little girl , from first taking the child , to the actual action .
The assailant bribes the child to come to him for sweets , and excites her with fantasies of toys and happiness , making a sick reference to male body parts with the line , `` toys you 've never seen . ''
Once the girl is in his control , he wo n't let her go .
`` Mr. Tinkertrain '' can be interpreted as the name given to the assaulter , as he appears to be so nice but goes with bad intentions from child to child like a train .
