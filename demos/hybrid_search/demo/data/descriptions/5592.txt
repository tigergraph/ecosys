Anna-Catherine Hartley is a Miami-born , Paris-based electro artist who records under the nom de plume of Uffie .
Her name comes from the French words `` Un Oeuf '' -LRB- an egg -RRB- , a nickname her father gave her as a child for being so rowdy .
Uffie wrote the song and it was helmed by Mirwais , who produced five songs on the album .
The electro crunk monster features rapper and producer Pharrell Williams performing guest vocals .
Uffie was certain she wanted Pharell involved when the track was coming together ; `` I was so excited when I was introduced to him in Tokyo a few years back that I knew if there was ever the right track I would have to ask him to be on it .
This was that track and , fortunately , he said yes . ''
This is the lead single from Uffie 's debut album Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans .
The long player was released June 14 , 2010 in Europe and June 22 , 2010 in the United States .
Uffie described the song as `` poking fun at the rap fraternity 's obsession with possessions , particularly their cars . ''
