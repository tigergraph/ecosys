For teenage singer-songwriter Greyson Chance , the closing track on his debut album Hold On 'Til the Night is the most significant one .
`` This song is just so important to me because it was basically when I was writing the song , I was basically thinking , ' I am screaming this out to all those people who doubted me , ' '' he said .
`` It 's one of those types of inspirational songs that I get my inspiration from . ''
