Guitarist Will Nutter -LRB- from The Alternative Press -RRB- : `` This song means so much to me .
While we were recording during the end of January , I lost my grandfather .
Anytime something like that happens , it 's extremely easy to put your thoughts and feelings into the form of a song .
I hope this song will be something everyone can relate to - not just me . ''
