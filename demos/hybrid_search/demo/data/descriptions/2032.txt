This dreamy ballad about contemplating a relationship features background vocals provided by Drake .
The Canadian rapper/singer told Rap-Up .
com about his collaboration with Keys : `` They reached out and she said she really wanted me to do something on her project .
But she wanted me to do me , not do an Alicia Keys record .
And man , she gave me one of the best studio experiences of my life . ''
He continued : `` I came in there and instead of being like , ` Here 's the beat , get to work , ' she was just like , ` Play me your favorite songs and lets battle . '
It 's almost like the transition from -LSB- listening to -RSB- great music to making a song - like , no one even noticed it , because she started playing the keys and I just started writing the melodies . ''
The song was partly inspired by Drake 's feelings for his Young Money label mate Nicki Minaj and also regarding Keys and her future husband , the producer Swiss Beatz .
The Canadian MC told Bet.com : `` It is -LSB- about Minaj -RSB- , I 'm not gon na lie .
The concept came from a conversation that we had , or conversations we have .
I wrote it based off two things : number one , based off that , and then two , based off Alicia -LSB- Keys -RSB- and Swizz and their situation and it just seemed fitting .
It was like the perfect concept . ''
The Jake Nava directed video was shot in Piru , California .
The clip is set in a small suburban town and tackles issues of interracial dating .
Nava said : `` Alicia is a true artist and I was very pleased that she was brave enough to go with this unusual concept .
`` Chad Michael Murray , who is best known for portraying Lucas Scott in One Tree Hill , plays Keys ' love interest .
Drake also expressed his feelings for Minaj in his own song Miss Me where he raps `` I love Nicki Minaj / I told her I 'd admit it / I hope one day we get married just to say we f -- ing did it . ''
