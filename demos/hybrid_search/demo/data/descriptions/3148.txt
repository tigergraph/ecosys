The song begins with Timbaland introducing `` JT & The Tennessee Kids '' to the audience .
-LRB- The Tennessee Kids are Timberlake 's live orchestra that accompanies him on performances . -RRB-
The cheesy introduction at the microphone serves as a flashback to the Justified track , `` Senorita , '' which starts in the same manner .
The song contains a sample from Jamaican reggae musician King Sporty 's track `` Self Destruct . ''
King Sporty is best known for co-authoring Bob Marley 's hit tune , '' Buffalo Soldier . ''
Timberlake debuted the song at a Super Bowl charity party on February 2 , 2013 .
Timberlake told MySpace how he recruited his Tennessee Kids backing band .
`` I just want to go and , like , rip everybody 's face off with some great musicians , '' he explained `` And so we just started scouting the best musicians we could find and we found a lot of 'em that grew up in the church , which was so appropriate for the stuff that I wrote for this album .
They 're killer .
And they make me sound way better than I am . ''
