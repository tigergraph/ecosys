This song was inspired by an actual incident that happened when Florence Welch was going out with a member of the punk band , The Ludes .
She explained : `` This was a song we wrote as a band -- most of the others were written by me with one other person .
It 's very literal .
My boyfriend at the time , who was in The Ludes , was going to build a coffin for the cover of their EP , so he could n't take me to the cinema . ''
