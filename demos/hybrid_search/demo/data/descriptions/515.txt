The theme of this song is Nepotism , which is something the band 's lead singer/songwriter Joe Sumner knows something about : he 's the son of Gordon Sumner , better known as Sting .
And while Joe is fully aware of his legacy and struggles to step out of his father 's shadow , this song is about something different .
Says Sumner : `` It discusses how unqualified and possibly unsuitable people can be , who find themselves in positions of power because of who they are .
`` Sumner has accepted some help from his dad - Fiction Plane opened for The Police on part of their 2007 reunion tour .
Said Joe : `` I just figured if it 's gon na happen anywhere , I might as well take full advantage .
I think we 're ready , we 've got a great band and great songs . ''
