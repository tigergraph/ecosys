Although this song is n't the first Our Lady Peace tune to contain handclaps , guitarist Steve Mazur says it is the first OLP tune to feature the effect so prominently .
Mazur adds , `` I think the handclaps just go along with the beat . ''
Continuing with the motif of trying new things on Curve , Our Lady Peace decided to record the individual drums on this song separately .
Guitarist Steve Mazur told us in 2012 that the idea behind this was to get `` a bombastic live , almost distorted , drum sound '' on the track .
