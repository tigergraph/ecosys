This strings-heavy cut is the opening track from Infinite Arms , the third album of indie rock band Band of Horses .
It was the last song to be written for the record .
Frontman Ben Bridwell told The Skinny about the inspirations for this track : `` I was listening to a lot of Nick Drake and was really enamoured by the string arrangements in his songs .
Also , I was trying to make it a bit dramatic sounding in a Bittersweet Symphony kinda way . ''
