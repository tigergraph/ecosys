This song finds Krule staring so intently at girl that he 's scarring her .
`` My sandpaper sight engraves a line into the rust of your tongue , '' he croons .
`` Yeah , I 'm scarring her tongue , her lust , her mouth , '' he told The Guardian .
`` I actually find a lot of pleasure in writing lyrics . ''
