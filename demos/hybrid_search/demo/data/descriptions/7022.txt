Rucker told The Boot about this collaboration with Brad Paisley : `` It was awesome .
He was part of the band .
He 's one of those guys that gets it .
He gets what he 's done , who he is . ''
Rucker told The Boot : `` It 's funny , it 's about two guys out on spring break having a good time . ''
The song was originally titled `` Do n't Know , Do n't Care . ''
Rucker expanded on the song to The Boot : `` It 's written from the perspective of two buddies taking time off from working , hanging out in Daytona or Panama City or something like that , having a good time .
It 's very funny . ''
