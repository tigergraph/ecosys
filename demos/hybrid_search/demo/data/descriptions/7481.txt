The second single from Heaven finds Ferguson singing about a guy that she 's met , claiming that the signs that she is n't interested in him are n't as they seem .
`` Hey , I lost my phone , '' she croons .
`` It must have fallen out in the street .
Maybe you called and I did n't pick up , and if you wondered that 's all it means . ''
The song 's music video was shot in Los Angeles and features Ferguson walking through the main strip of Venice Beach , past a string of distinctive characters .
It corresponds with the song 's message that all that is good can not be lost .
This is one of five tracks on Heaven that Ferguson co-wrote with British songwriter Eg White , whose other credits also include Will Young 's Ivor Novello winning hit `` Leave Right Now '' and Adele 's international smash , `` Chasing Pavements . ''
Ferguson recalled to Artist Direct : `` When I first went in to work with Eg White , he played me this song .
At the time , it was just a melody .
It was a few lyrics and a really good drum beat .
He was n't sure of it at the time .
I kept asking him to work on it though .
In the end , we had time and we worked on it .
It was about when you meet someone , and you just ca n't stop thinking about them .
It 's those first moments of meeting somebody and letting them know they mean a lot to you .
It was one of the songs we had a lot of fun writing and producing .
Out of the album , we spent the most time on that track because we wanted to get it just right .
It 's one of my favorites to listen to as well . ''
