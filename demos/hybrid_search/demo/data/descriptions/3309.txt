The lyrics are based on a home video of Bono 's mother where she is wearing lemon -LRB- yellow -RRB- .
She died when Bono was 14 .
On their Popmart tour , the band came out of a giant lemon .
Video was based on the motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge , a photographer who used a series of still cameras to create `` stop-action '' video of motion .
He is famous for a series of shots at a racetrack that proved horses do at times run with all 4 legs in the air .
