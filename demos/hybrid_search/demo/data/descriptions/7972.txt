After eight months recording the Breakfast In America album , the group 's mainstays Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson were not getting along .
Their conflicting personalities led to a great deal of tension , and as each had a role in crafting the songs , there was often a power struggle over what made it to the record .
As Davies explained to Melody Maker after the album was released , `` Casual Conversations '' dealt with their relationship .
Said Davies : `` That song , for me , is deeply personal .
It can obviously relate to people , as well as boy-girl .
I suppose it 's me and Roger to a degree ; me not being able to communicate with him , wanting to get out at times . ''
