This is the third single from American record producer Timbaland 's third studio album , Shock Value II .
The long player is Timbaland 's first not to carry a Parental Advisory or to contain the `` n word '' .
Timbaland told MTV that this is his favorite track on Shock Value II .
He explained : `` That is my favorite , favorite record .
Me and my best friend J.T. - Justin Timberlake .
That -LSB- song -RSB- reminds me of a 2010 ` Drop It Like It 's Hot . '
All these sounds from all over . ''
`` Carry Out '' is a southern name for a shop or restaurant where customers pick up food for consumption elsewhere , and in this song Timba and Timber use the term as a metaphor for what they would like to happen with some eye candy of the female persuasion .
The song features Justin Timberlake with whom Timbaland has collaborated several times previously , including on the Grammy-nominated `` Give It To Me . ''
He told MTV News : `` We got a chemistry that can not be described .
People ask , ` Well , what are you and Justin like ? '
Ca n't tell you what it 's like - it 's a chemistry that ca n't be described .
Something you would have to see for yourself and be , like , ` Them two got magic . ' ''
Timbaland told MTV News that the studio session for this song was similar to their previous collaborations .
Timberlake came in , heard the track , and without a pad or pen , composed the lyrics in his head .
The producer explained the lyrical content to MTV News : `` We tried to give another slang for women .
Instead of ` Your phat butt ' or ` Your big breasts , ' we say , ` Oh , I need you .
Can I be your carry out ?
Be my carry out .
I want you to be my dinner , my leftovers , my everything . '
It 's a different slang .
We 're grown men , I wan na be subliminal to females .
Like , ` Oooh , carry out ?
That 's kinda sexy . ' ''
