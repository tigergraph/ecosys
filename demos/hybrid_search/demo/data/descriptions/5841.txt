This atmospheric song is filled with guitars crashing into one another .
Frontman Justin Furstenfeld explained to MusicRadar.com how the band built the giant guitar sounds .
`` In the chorus to ` Bleed Out , ' I wanted to make the 16th notes on the hi-hat so much more prominent , '' he said , `` they could n't drag .
So what we did was , we took the bass and fuzzed the hell out of it , and then we chopped the parts up in that 16th-note pattern .
We did n't play it on a synth ; instead , we got Matt -LSB- Noveskey , guitar and bass -RSB- to play some really hot licks .
Then C.B. -LSB- Hudson , guitar -RSB- came in and did his wall of sound . ''
`` Once we gave that to Tim Palmer to mix , '' Furstenfeld continued , `` forget it -- it was on its way .
Tim has a way of making everything incredible .
He 's the baddest motherfu -- er I 've ever met .
I did some airy s -- t on top of it all -- feedback and some Cocteau Twins-sounding stuff .
Once you put all of that together , you have a pretty eclectic-sounding song . ''
The song 's music video was filmed in Dallas , Texas on June 15 , 2013 with director Norry Niven .
