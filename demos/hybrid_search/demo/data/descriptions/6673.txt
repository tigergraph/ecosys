Linkin Park worked with former Arcade Fire violin player Owen Pallett on this ballad 's string arrangements after drummer Rob Bourdon reached out to him .
Frontman Mike Shinoda said regarding the collaboration : `` I 've not met him in person though , I think he may have met our drummer Rob , those two were emailing back and forth .
I really love what he did with the song and what he did with Arcade Fire is just sensational . ''
Chester Bennington 's vocals come from a character that is planning on leaving home before the sun comes up .
A video art installation that dabbles in astronomy was made based on the song 's lyrical content .
`` The visuals for ` I 'll Be Gone ' stuck out to me because that song is a relationship-based song , but it 's also got a second read of a space theme , '' Shinoda explained to Rolling Stone .
`` A lot of the songs have metaphors , and one of the metaphors in that song is space .
-LSB- The visual artists -RSB- picked up on that language and turned it into this weird , intergalactic space travel thing . ''
