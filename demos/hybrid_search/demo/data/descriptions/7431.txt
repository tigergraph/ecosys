Produced by Victor Trim , it was initially a limited release on the Victim label before being picked up by Jetstar .
Trim and Gabrielle subsequently fell out over business matters but the track began to receive some airplay .
However it was deleted after objections by Tracy Chapman to the sample of `` Fast Car . ''
The song subsequently was picked up by an A&R man at London 's Go !
Beat records and they contacted Gabrielle .
After signing her , the track was re-recorded without the Chapman sample and it became an international hit .
When this became a hit , Victor Trim took Gabrielle to court claiming that he had produced the music for this song and that he owned the lyrics because she had assigned him her rights in a publishing deal that she was supposed to have signed .
However it was completely untrue and eventually his lawyers withdrew .
