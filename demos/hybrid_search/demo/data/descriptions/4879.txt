Korn frontman Jonathan Davis explained to Billboard magazine how the shooting of a rat inspired this song : `` At my house , where we smoke , there 's a tree over , and the rats like to eat the berries .
And I hate the rats , and I hate when they drop off and hit one of my kids or we 're out there smoking and one drops in our hair .
I pulled out my .22 , and I have these varmint rounds ... and I capped that -LSB- rat -RSB- and watched him bleed out .
That inspired me to write ` Bleeding Out . ' ''
The song was produced by English drum & bass producer Feed Me , whose other credits include Example 's single `` Midnight Run . ''
