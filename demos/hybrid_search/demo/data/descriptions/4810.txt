This features vocal samples from Young Jeezy 's 2006 album track `` I Got Money . ''
Kanye West told concreteloop.com about what he feels is the wide appeal of this song : `` I hear records that are super hot for two months , but the records wo n't last in people 's minds .
I set out not to just make records that could hop off the radio instantly , but stuff that will speak to people .
People still bring up ` Spaceships ' to me .
And people compare ` Ca n't Tell Me Nothing ' to ` Spaceships ' saying that 's a song that inspires them when they going to work .
But the chords itself , is like a Led Zeppelin , Rock melody .
Yeah , you thinking it 's made for the car and you thinking it 's made for the club , and it works in the arena because DJ Toomp did the drums and all that , but the actual melody is made to rock 50,000 people . ''
