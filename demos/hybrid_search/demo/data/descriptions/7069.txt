This is the title track and lead single from American Idol season 8 finalist Danny Gokey .
Written by veteran Music Row writers Marv Green and Kent Blazy , the track 's sentiments about looking back at past mistakes but realizing the best days lie ahead , are particular poignant as Gokey 's wife died shortly before the artist 's audition for the show .
After he lost his wife , Blazy nearly stopped writing altogether .
He told The Tennessean : `` I was here at the house by myself day after day and night after night .
I started just writing songs about what I was feeling and all these songs came out .
`` Blazy found the process therapeutic and at the end of it , was ready to start writing with co-writers again .
He called Marv Green and this cut was the first song that they wrote together .
`` It 's making a statement of what I choose my future to be , '' said Blazy .
`` That song honored her because of how she gave me more faith .
After she died , I looked at my life like the Big Bang theory .
What I had up until then was an amazing life , but it 's not my life anymore so I have to reinvent myself , and I can be anything I want to be . ''
During an interview with Washington , D.C.-area radio station WMZQ , Gokey discussed the connection he shares with Kent Blazy .
He said : `` I recorded this song months ago and gave it to radio , and I just found recently that the writer ... he lost his wife last year in January .
And this is the first song that he wrote after his wife passed away .
Can you believe it ?
He said he was ready to start writing again after the tragedy .
He said , ' I was walking through the park , and I heard someone walk past , and he said , ` My best days are ahead of me . '
And -LSB- Kent -RSB- said , ` That 's what started the song idea . '
This song is my anthem . ''
Other songs Blaze has co-written include Garth Brooks ' first country # 1 `` If Tomorrow Never Comes '' and `` Gettin ' You Home -LRB- The Black Dress Song -RRB- '' by Chris Young .
