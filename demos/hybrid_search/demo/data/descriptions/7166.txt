This is a track from the self-titled debut solo album by producer and TV on the Radio guitarist Dave Sitek , recorded under the guise of Maximum Balloon .
The song features Sitek 's friend Aku , who is singer for the Brooklyn psych-rockers Dragons of Zynth .
The lyrics were written before the whole Tiger Woods sex scandal blew up .
Sitek told The Guardian : `` The double entendre in the lyrics -LSB- `` you let your tiger out '' -RSB- was intentional , although we did n't plan on it coming out during the whole Tiger Woods thing .
It could be the best Nike commercial ever !
Or the best condom commercial . ''
Sitek told The Guardian : `` This was the song that started the whole thing , the flame that burned the forest .
I was in the studio waiting for something to upload so I just started making a beat , then I added bass and a guitar part and some crazy Parliament s -- t. Out of boredom I even added some vocals of my own .
It started as a joke but I figured that if I could get Aku to sing on it he could make it a real thing , so I begged him to come to the studio and fix my vocal parts . ''
This song went viral when Daisy Lowe , Gavin Rossdale 's model daughter , stripped to the track in a video shoot for Esquire .
Sitek recalled to Rolling Stone : `` She heard it and then called me and was like , ' I hope you do n't mind I used the song for a video I did .
I 'm dancing around in my underwear . '
I was like , ` okay . ' ''
