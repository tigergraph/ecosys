Viva Brother are an indie band hailing from Slough in Middlesex , England with a brashness similar to Oasis and Kasabian .
The quartet comprises Lee Newell -LRB- frontman -RRB- Josh Ward -LRB- bassist -RRB- , Sam Jackson -LRB- guitarist -RRB- and Frank Colucci -LRB- drums -RRB- .
Brother has received a lot of flak from the music press for persistently claiming they are the future of rock music .
This is their second single release , of which frontman Leonard Newell told NME : `` It 's a bit self-depreciating that tune .
It 's cool to hate us , but we 'll still be here .
We know what we 're doing . ''
Viva Brother were formerly known as Brother , but were forced to change their name after a US-based `` powerhouse Celtic tribal trio '' of the same name threatened legal action . ''
Newell explained the song 's meaning to Consequence of Sound : '' ` Still Here ' is basically about us just trying to do what we want to do , despite everything in our way .
At the time , that was a lot of small-minded people .
It 's a bit of a testament to ourselves .
We 're patting ourselves on the back a little ! ''
