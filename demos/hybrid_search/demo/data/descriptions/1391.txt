Arthur Freed was originally inspired to write the lyrics for this when he saw from his Seattle sheet music shop a man saturated by rain dancing past his shop window .
Nacio Herb Brown wrote the music to this .
It debuted in one of the first musical sound films , Hollywood Revue 1929 , in which Cliff Edwards performed the song .
Some years later , Arthur Freed , now a producer for MGM , wanted to increase the revenue from his old lyrics so he commissioned Betty Comden and Adolphe Green to construct a musical around his songs , which became the film Singin ' In The Rain .
Gene Kelly , who was sick with a cold , performed this famous rain drenched dance number in the movie over 2 days while struggling with a fever of 103 degrees .
The rain was made up of a blend of water and milk to make sure it showed up on camera .
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England -RRB- In 1971 , the Gene Kelly recording of this song got another outing when it was played over the closing credits of Stanley Kubrick 's A Clockwork Orange .
Earlier in the film , Malcolm McDowell hummed the tune as he and his colleagues carried out a robbery , assault and rape .
In 2005 a big beat version by electronic act Mint Royale peaked at # 20 in the UK thanks to its use in a Gene Kelly cgi-enhanced TV advertisement for Volkswagen Golf .
It returned to the UK Top 30 in 2008 as a result of 14-year-old George Sampson winning the talent show Britain 's Got Talent with a recreation of the dance routine used in the ad .
To the surprise of many chart-watchers , in its second week on the chart it made a Gene Kelly-like leap all the way to the top position .
