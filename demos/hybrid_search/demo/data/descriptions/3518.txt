This song finds The Stereophonics collaborating with James Bond composer David Arnold .
Frontman Kelly Jones told The Sun : `` He was on our wishlist and through our producer Jim Lowe I was asked if I wanted to meet him .
He put a 36-piece orchestra on it .
Half of them have played on every James Bond movie since Dr No , so it was a great experience .
I took my dad to that one -- he got a bit emotional . ''
