`` S.O.S. '' is the Morse code signal for distress , chosen because it is a simple series of 3 dots -LRB- `` S '' -RRB- followed by 3 dashes -LRB- `` O '' -RRB- , and 3 more dots that can be repeated over and over until someone hears it .
It was used in the days when the telegraph was used for communication , and while those days are long gone , the phrase `` S.O.S. '' continues to be used as a symbol of distress .
Some of the lyrics came from `` Tainted Love , '' including , `` I toss and turn , I ca n't sleep at night . ''
The song has two music videos .
One is a Nike promotional video featuring Rihanna dancing in a nightclub .
