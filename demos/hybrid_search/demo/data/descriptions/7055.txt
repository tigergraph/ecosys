Jonathan Richman wrote this 2 chord garage anthem in his father 's car in 1972 .
During the summer of 1977 when Punk and New Wave music were finding a wider audience in Britain , this song became a hit .
Among the Modern Lovers playing on this song were keyboard player Jerry Harrison who later joined Talking Heads and drummer David Robinson , who later joined The Cars .
The producer was Velvet Underground member John Cale .
Richman and his band The Modern Lovers recorded a collection of songs including this one in 1973 .
However problems with their label blocked the songs ' release until 1976 .
According to Rolling Stone Magazine 's Top 500 Songs , Richman was obsessed with the Velvet Underground .
When he started his own band , he rewrote the Velvets ' `` Sister Ray '' into this song .
