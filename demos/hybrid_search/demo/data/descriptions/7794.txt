This song is a funny , satirical homage to America .
The shock-rock legend displays his famous wry sense of humor on this track with over-the-top patriotic lyrics .
This song brings back fond , kitschy memories of the 1970s : Wonder Bread , Krazy Glue , The Pocket Fisherman , etc. .
This song is from Alice Cooper 's fifteenth studio album , DaDa .
One of its themes is mental illness , with Cooper 's character assuming many different personalities .
The album also references Dadaism , which was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th Century ; the cover art is based on a painting by the surrealist artist Salvador Dali titled `` Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire . ''
In the late '70s , Cooper spent time with Dali , who experimented with the Dada art style .
`` I Love America '' was written by Cooper , Dick Wagner , Graham Shaw and Bob Ezrin .
Wagner is an acclaimed guitarist/songwriter who in the '70s toured with Lou Reed and became the hired gun for producer Ezrin .
Through that association , he worked with many of the top names in the music game as both a songwriter and guitarist - Roy Orbison , Etta James and Little Richard among them .
Wagner was known for the Rock ballads he wrote or co-wrote for Cooper 's albums , which include `` You And Me , '' `` I Never Cry '' and `` Only Women Bleed . ''
Bob Ezrin , who was one of the most renowned and commercially successful Rock producers of the 1970s , produced the DaDa album .
No stranger to conceptual work , Ezrin also produced Pink Floyd 's The Wall and Lou Reed 's Berlin .
