This is a track from English alternative rock band Arctic Monkeys ' third album , Humbug .
Eight out of ten tracks on Humbug were produced by Queens of the Stone Age singer-guitarist Josh Homme and on this track Homme also played the castanets .
In addition , the American hired help can also be heard singing on this tack , `` I 'm pinned down by the dark . ''
Turner told Q magazine that Homme `` started off singing some vocals to show us some ideas and we 'd say , ` That 's brilliant .
You do it . ''
If there is a recurrent theme on Humbug , it 's about chasing a girl , which many fans are suggesting is frontman and chief songwriter Alex Turner 's TV presenter girlfriend , Alexa Chung .
In which case this hypnotic low-rocker is about Turner 's pursuit of Chung , who it appears played hard to get .
In an interview with MTV News , Turner compared Josh Homme 's working methods with Bill Sykes from Charles Dickens ' Oliver Twist .
He said : `` Josh who takes a bit of a Bill Sykes approach to it .
The way Bill Sykes would approach eating an apple - like with a dagger - Josh is like that with the task . ''
