This song was written in 2006 in Italy while Mastodon were in Europe on the Blood Mountain tour .
The band also penned `` Crack The Skye '' on the same day .
The animated video was directed by Californian pop-surrealist artist Tim Biskup , whose artwork is highly regarded by the band .
Biskup explained the concept behind the clip as , `` basically about waking up to find yourself being chased by death and having to reckon with dying and what that actually means to you . ''
`` It 's a life/death metaphor where the girl in the video goes from hunted to hunter , '' he continued .
`` There 's a whole lot more going on metaphorically , and the symbolism goes very deep and is very specific , but I 'll leave the rest up to interpretation . ''
Vocalist and bassist Troy Sanders recalled to Kerrang !
magazine : `` Brent -LRB- Hinds , vocals/guitar -RRB- was playing a real simple , Melvin-ish rock riff and I just took out my Dictaphone and recorded him .
Five years later , it was still rocking , so Brent relearned it and we threw in some other interesting ideas and we started grooving to it . ''
