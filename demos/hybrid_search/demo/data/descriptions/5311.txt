This song was inspired by the Egyptian revolution of 2011 .
`` Watching a country unit without mass destruction or an overwhelming amount of fatalities is awe inspiring , '' said vocalist Stephen Christian .
`` I understand that there will be war , but -LSB- their protest -RSB- gives me hope that , in the future , others will learn from this form of non-violence for massive worldwide reform . ''
Stephen Christian spoke to us in late 2012 shortly after viewing the attack on the American consulate in Libya that left four people dead , which he feels have left `` an ironic twist '' to this song .
The violent reaction was blamed at the time on the clips posted on YouTube of the anti-Islamic film Innocence of Muslims , though it was later confirmed they were a planned terrorist attack and unrelated to the film.Christian explained that initially he `` was really inspired by the Egyptian revolution , '' as it appeared to be `` very , very peaceful in comparison to what it could have been . ''
It was amazing to him to `` see an entire country come together without picking up weapons .
Instead they protested and they told the government , ` This has to change . ' ''
However `` several months later , and we just had four Americans die at an embassy because of a video that one person put together and put online .
`` For Stephen the irony lies in his admiration for a culture whereby `` through simple protests and non violent movements in the vein of Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. , changed an entire government . ''
However watching the deaths of four people at the American consulate in Libya made him decide `` that the people can only go so far with that . ''
Stephen concluded that the lesson he 's `` learned is that we have come far as a civilization .
But we still have a lot to work on .
And ` Someone , Anyone ' talks about how once you step into the realm of violence , no one can walk away truly alive , i.e. , the people that sadly passed away .
But also the Egyptian people I feel have lost something .
The movement that made them who they are is now seen as not having come far enough .
And so it 's just admonishment to the world as a whole that there are ways to solve problems other than violence . ''
