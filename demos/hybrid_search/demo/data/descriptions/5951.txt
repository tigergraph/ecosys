This song finds Kid Rock paying tribute to his home city .
It is a cover of a 1965 soul B-side by Ronnie Love , with some lyrics revamped by the Detroit singer .
`` I 've been writing songs about Detroit since the beginning of my career , '' Rock told Detroit Free Press .
`` This finally hits the nail on the head . ''
The song is punctuated by saxophone from Detroit based jazz musician Dave McMurray .
McMurray was regarded as one of the finest avant expressionists in his 1980 's heyday with Griot Galaxy and has since been a member of Was , Not Was .
Co-Engineer Al Sutton told Detroit Free Press the track is typical of the `` classic Kid Rock style '' of song production with live drums set atop a programmed beat .
`` That 's the way he writes , '' he said .
`` He 'll put a beat together on his MPC -LRB- drum machine -RRB- , lay down his idea for a guitar or another part , and make a rough arrangement of the song , usually with a vocal idea .
So he 'll have this rough skeleton , and then we record to that . ''
