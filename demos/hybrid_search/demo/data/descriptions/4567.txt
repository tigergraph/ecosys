Rihanna is from The Barbados , and this song is heavy on Caribbean dance rhythms .
The song takes place in a dance club , and Pon De Replay translates to `` Play it again '' in the local Barbados dialect Bajan .
Rihanna sings about wanting more of her favorite song when she 's on the dance floor , and she wants it louder .
This was included on the demo tape that got Rihanna a spot on Jay-Z 's record label .
Rihanna was discovered by an American record producer/songwriter named Evan Rogers , who spotted the 16-year-old singer when he was on vacation in Barbados .
He helped put her demo take together , which included an early version of `` Pon De Replay . ''
Rogers wrote the song with his songwriting partner Carl Sturken , and also Vada Nobles and Alisha Brooks .
This song hit # 1 in New Zealand and Portugal .
In the US it was held back from the # 1 spot by Mariah Carey 's `` We Belong Together . ''
Jay-Z personally introduced the then-unknown Rihanna and this Caribbean-inspired jam to personnel of Clear Channel , who are the largest radio station group owner in the United States .
On hearing it , one of the staff physically drove the single to Z100 's studio in New York City to break the song .
