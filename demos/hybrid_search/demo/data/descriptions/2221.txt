Billie Joe Armstrong wrote this about `` fake '' people , like those in Hollywood .
The lyrics , `` All dressed up , red-blooded mannequin '' show his feelings about them putting up a front and being `` plastic . ''
-LRB- thanks , Tanya - London , England -RRB- After the bridge , right before Billie Joe starts singing , `` I see you ... '' you can hear someone cough .
It 's probably Billie because he sounds out of breath when he starts singing again .
