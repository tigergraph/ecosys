This features the English singer-songwriter Corinne Bailey-Rae .
After she arrived from London , Corinne went straight to work .
Green recalled on the EMI press release : `` She 's a tiny little thing with a big guitar .
She 's just playing and singing and the musicians went to sit in , the drummer , the bassist .
She wrote a verse , then I wrote a verse and we both worked on the bridge . ''
