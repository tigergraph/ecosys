Miami beat maker Jim Jonson , who provided additional production told MTV News about the Pitbull version of this Shakira song : `` It 's funny .
I 've done three sessions with her .
I brought Pitbull into one of the sessions .
He convinced her to come to the Dominican Republic .
He took her to Little Havana .
He took her to the ` hood clubs .
She came to me , and she had some ideas to do some mambo .
I told her I do n't really do mambo , but we can find the best players , and I can produce it .
We sat down , and she had some ideas .
I had ideas , and Pit had ideas . ''
