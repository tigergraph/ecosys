Guitarist Omar Rodriguez Lopez told Rolling Stone magazine : '' ` Asilos Magdalena , ' started as an exercise .
My dad played guitar with the thumb and first finger on his picking hand .
I wanted to play like that and turned it into a song . ''
`` Asilos Magdalena '' is Spanish for Magdalen Asylums , which are Roman Catholic institutions intended for the rehabilitation of `` fallen women . ''
