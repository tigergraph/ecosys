Roger Waters wrote all of the songs on The Final Cut , which was his last album with Pink Floyd .
In `` The Hero 's Return , '' he sings about the homecoming of a soldier who needs understanding but receives adulation , which does him no good .
Waters was very much antiwar , as he saw the trauma inflicted on the returning soldiers .
He says that the character in this song is the teacher portrayed in the 1979 Pink Floyd album The Wall - a person with considerable demons whose only job prospect is in the school system .
At the end of this song , we learn that our hero is haunted by hearing his war comrade 's dying voice over an intercom .
This song has a missing last verse : `` Jesus Christ , I might as well be deadif I ca n't see how dangerous it must feel to betraining human cogs for the machinewithout some shell-shocked lunatic like mebombarding their still soft shoreswith sticks and stones that were lying aroundin the pile of unspeakable feelings I 'd foundwhen I turned back the stone turned over the stoneof my own disappointment back home .
`` This verse references `` lunatic '' from `` Brain Damage , '' and The Machine from the Wish You Where Here album .
