On this song Jennings tackles the AIDS epidemic , letting people know that just when they think they have it bad , there 's someone out there dealing with something much worse .
Djbooth.net asked Jennings why he felt the topic of AIDS was n't bought up more by artists .
He replied : `` I think it 's political .
When you align yourself with political issues , some shows do n't want you to come on because they 're lighter shows .
It 's already just a few shows , but you shrink that number drastically when you are a certain kind of person .
How we can change that is somebody is gon na have to have some success with doin ' it , and then other people will see that you can be successful doin ' something like that and still be accepted on these shows . ''
