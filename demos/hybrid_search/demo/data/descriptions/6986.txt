Modestep are a four-piece dance and dubstep band from London that formed in 2010 .
They comprise brothers Tony -LRB- Turntables -RRB- and Josh Friend -LRB- vocals -RRB- who have both been DJing since the turn of the century , along with Josh 's roommate Matthew Curtis -LRB- drums -RRB- and Nick Tsang -LRB- guitar -RRB- .
This is their second single , which was released by Polydor records on August 12 , 2011 .
The music video was released on YouTube on July 3 , 2011 , passing 1 million views within four days .
The song is an older track that was re-visited by the band for a single release .
Josh told Beatzbase about the tune : `` The style of the track is a combination of styles that have influenced us musically , we have the hard hitting/electronic sounds from dubstep , electric guitars from our rock background , some soul influences with the vocal and breakdown sections and also a transition to drum and bass/drumstep at the end .
The overall tone we were going for was an aggressive yet anthemic summer track that could be played in clubs but also could sit comfortably on your iPod too . ''
