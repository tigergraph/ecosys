This a track from Texan alternative rock band Blue October 's sixth studio album , Any Man In America .
The record chronicles the deeply personal events that transpired in singer Justin Furstenfeld 's life during and after the band 's 2009 album Approaching Normal .
Furstenfeld told Artist Direct that Any Man in America marked the first instance of his writing as something was happening to him .
`` I was writing along the way , '' he said .
`` At the very end , I thought the idea could be about getting over being a selfish pr -- k and abusing drugs .
When I did this album , I was with Steve Lillywhite recording Approaching Normal .
I 'd be home at night .
I told my wife and child to come down and stay with me at lake house where we were recording in Austin , because it was the only time we could be together for a little while .
It 'd be like a normal day .
She never came though .
I started wondering what was going on then and I wrote ` For the Love . '
It was a weekend that she could 've been there .
I was like , ` Why would n't she be here ?
Why would n't she want to stay in a lake house and listen to the record as it 's being recorded ? '
The more it went on , the more I got confused .
I thought , ` Why are we even married if you do n't want to be around me ? '
It was life-altering .
Now she 's done that , and I 'd write about it . ''
Noisecreep asked Furstenfeld if he thinks his raw and emotive lyrics in Blue October sometimes gives away too much about his personal life ?
He replied : `` Of course my lyrics attract people that are going through the stuff that I am .
That 's why I do it .
I do it for those people .
I do n't write music for people that are brave .
Blue October is n't meant for dudes that wake up and say , ` I 'm the sh -- ! '
I write for people in pain . ''
