This dark , prickly tune is The Civil Wars ' take on an Americana murder ballad .
Joy Williams said : `` It was fun writing because we just imagined some dust-bowl scenario , a broke-down town , and a man awaiting being hung for something he did in the name of trying to provide for his family .
The woman who loves him is watching him standing there on the gallows . ''
Williams recalled when she first came up with the song 's melody : `` I was doing my makeup in the tiled bathroom upstairs , with my newborn Miles in a yellow rocking bassinet next to me , '' she said .
`` I started singing , and turned on the voice memo app on my iPhone so I would n't forget it .
As I sang , Miles started cooing along with me .
Not on pitch , mind you , but I 'd move a note , and he 'd move a note .
I 'm never deleting that voice memo .
It 's become one of my favorites . ''
