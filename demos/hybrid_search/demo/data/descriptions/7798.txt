Frontman Burton C. Bell explained this song in publicity materials : `` One molecule of oxygen can alter the course of the world .
It can start the deterioration slowly through rust , or it can quickly incinerate everything in its path .
Either way , change is going to happen .
This is about the trial by fire . ''
