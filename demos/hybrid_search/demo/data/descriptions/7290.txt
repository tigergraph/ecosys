This song with themes of adultery and life on the road was written by X 's husband-and-wife team of Exene Cervenka and John Doe , but was mostly written by Cervenka .
In our interview with John Doe , he said she wrote `` probably all of the lyrics and a lot of the melody for ` Under the Big Black Sun . ' ''
The song was influenced by the death of Exene 's sister Mirielle , who lost her life in a 1980 car accident .
The Under The Big Black Sun album is dedicated to her .
Speaking with Sounds a few months after her sister 's death , Exene explained that many of her lyrics come from sadness , and `` if that does n't make enough desperation and sadness in my life , then I do n't know what does . ''
Under The Big Black Sun was the first album X released on Elektra Records , and like their first two albums , it was produced by Ray Manzarek of The Doors .
