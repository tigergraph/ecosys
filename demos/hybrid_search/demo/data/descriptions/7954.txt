This Max Martin and Shellback penned up-tempo number features a Euro-pop whistle motif .
The song was one of seven that co-executive producer Max Martin contributed to Femme Fatale and his relationship with Spears goes way back to her debut single , '' ... Baby One More Time , '' which he wrote .
Spears told Rolling Stone why the Swedish hitmaker gets the best out of her : `` Max played a huge role on this album and he has been there since the beginning so there is such a huge level of trust .
He gets exactly what I am saying when I tell him what I want and do n't want musically .
His melodies are incredible and he is always coming up with weird sounds , which I love .
The whistle on ' I Wan na Go ' still gets me every time I hear it .
Who would have thought of that ?
There is nobody I feel more comfortable collaborating with in the studio . ''
The Marrs Piliero directed video was filmed in Los Angeles , California and finds Britney poking fun at the idea of the sexy pop star .
It co-stars Weeds and Half Baked actor Guillermo Diaz as the convertible driver.One of many pop culture references that litter the video is a movie theater marquee that reads `` Crossroads 2 : Cross Harder , '' alluding to the 2002 film , in which Britney had her first major role .
Piliero told the New York Post it was , `` a fun Easter egg for fans .
Plus , Die Hard 2 : Die Harder is the most ridiculously awesome way to title a sequel .
It just felt like the right thing to do .
When Britney saw it , she loved it . ''
