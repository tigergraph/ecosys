This is a reworking of a 1973 song by the band Argent titled `` God Gave Rock 'n' Roll to You . ''
Kiss ' version adds lyrics dedicated to Eric Carr , who lost his battle with carcinoma in 1991 .
The Argent song was written by their lead singer Russ Ballard , who got a songwriting credit on the Kiss song along with Paul Stanley , Gene Simmons , and their producer Bob Ezrin .
-LRB- thanks , Beau - Phoenix , AZ -RRB- In an interview with VH1 , Gene Simmons said : `` It 's not just a cover song for a soundtrack , but a testament to Eric Carr , and I think a lot of people do n't realize that . ''
This was the last Kiss song that Eric Carr appeared on .
Carr was their drummer since 1982 , and died of cancer in 1991 at age 42 .
Carr also appeared in the video , which was shot while he was being treated for the disease .
Bruce Kulick , who was the Kiss guitarist at the time , recalled in the book Tales From The Stage : `` He played his heart out .
He had more energy than I did .
I could n't believe it , but it meant a lot to him .
You can see in his face in the video and photos that it 's kind of drawn .
You can tell that he was n't healthy and fighting a disease , but I must say that he was very brave . ''
Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley share lead vocals on this song , which they had n't done since `` Shout It Out Loud . ''
-LRB- thanks , Donovan Berry - El Dorado , AR , for above 3 -RRB-
