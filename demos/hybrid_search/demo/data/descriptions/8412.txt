She feels lost everywhere they go , but is too attached to leave him .
Producer and songwriter Micah Otano -LRB- Anastacia 's `` Burning Star , '' Fantasia 's `` Overload '' -RRB- , sued Ocean , claiming that he based the track on of his songs without giving any due credit .
Otano claimed that he previously collaborated with Ocean 's producer partner Malay , and that the two men co-wrote a track called `` Daylight , '' which , he alleged , Malay then ripped off for this song.The court case stated that Otano is seeking royalties as well as songwriting and production credits for the track .
The song samples some dialogue from the 1998 movie about excess , Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas .
The Francisco Soriano-directed video is a whirlwind of concert footage and behind the scenes shots of Frank Ocean while on his 2012 , Channel Orange tour .
