Pistol Annies are an all-female trio who formed after singer-songwriters and friends Miranda Lambert and Ashley Monroe got together for a song writing session .
As they shared stories , Ashley decided Miranda needed to meet her friend and fellow songwriter Angaleena Presley .
Following a midnight phone call between the three ladies , the group was born .
Ashley and Miranda wrote this song about a shotgun wedding the night they called Angaleena to invite her to make up the threesome .
Monroe recalled to CMT News : `` We were at Miranda 's house in Oklahoma .
Miranda walked in the living room and said , ` Beige ! '
I said , ` What 's beige ? '
She said , ` The song is about beige because she 's wearing beige down the aisle .
I 'm going to go make a drink .
Have the first line done by the time I get back . '
