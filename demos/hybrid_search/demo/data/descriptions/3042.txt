Atkins said in the Augusta Chronicle that this patriotic song hit him the very first time that he heard it .
He explained : `` It 's just one of those pick-you-up and make-you-pump-your-fists-and-sing-along kind of songs . ''
Atkins added : `` It has become kind of an anthem for folks struggling .
I have seen people at shows pumping their fists and singing along with tears in their eyes and realized how real the lyrics are for some people . ''
This was the 5th country # 1 for Atkins .
His previous four all came from the country singer 's 2006 album If You 're Going Through Hell .
