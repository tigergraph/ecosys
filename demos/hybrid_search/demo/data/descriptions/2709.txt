Frontman and songwriter Bert McCracken explained the song 's meaning to Kerrang !
: `` The song is about our place in music , from our perspective .
We started this band because we love music - period .
We never really wanted to be the biggest band in the world : none of us aspired to be really famous or to be rockstars .
I think that 's an idea that does n't really exist anymore . ''
McCracken explained the meaning of the lyric , `` They 're just a face all covered with a rag , '' to Kerrang !
`` I think that imagery speaks volumes about the amount of people who are in the music industry for the wrong reasons , '' he said , `` A&R guys , record label reps and radio guys .
That includes people in bands , who want to have their fat 10 minutes of f -- ing whatever .
That idea is poisonous in music , and that 's what those lyrics refer to . ''
