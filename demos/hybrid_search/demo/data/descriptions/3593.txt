The reading list of Florence Welch , the vocalist and main person of Florence + the Machine , is evidently extensive and morbid .
This song , which started of being originally about a werewolf before developing into a ditty about extremely passionate love , was clearly influenced by the gothic horror stories she read as a child .
Welch told The Scotsman January 25 , 2009 : `` When I was a kid , I was physically afraid of monsters and ghosts , vampires and werewolves .
It was a scary couple of years and I do n't know if I am over it yet .
I 've toned it down but I still have to wake up at night and turn the light on .
Now I translate it into songs and try to become the werewolf . ''
Welch says this song is very hard on her voice , telling Entertainment Weekly in 2012 that she had `` gotten tired of singing '' it .
Welch told the story behind the song on her website : `` I was in a really intense emotional state for this one !
I 'd been so drunk and so badly behaved that I felt like a beast , I felt feral .
I turned up to the studio wearing the same clothes from the night before and I was an emotional wreck .
I was thinking about the extremes you go to when you 're in love , the way it takes over , and how that then turns into wanting to rip and tear .
Young love starts off so instant , but then you make mistakes , and it becomes sordid , sometimes .
And dangerous .
Then while we were in the studio , I got so over-involved with the idea of werewolves !
I took this idea and ran with it , and all the ideas just came from Gothic horror : werewolves and wedding dresses , and licking beating hearts .
It was cool , because it got me out of my bad place , and into a creative place .
When I was singing the refrain and doing the piano part , I suddenly realised , ` At least something 's come out of this . '
It 's a release , for me . ''
