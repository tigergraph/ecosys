Darwin Deez leader Darwin Smith explained to NME this love/hate anthem is a `` true story about a wild child I once met and fell for . ''
The guitar solo was inspired by Washington D.C. post-hardcore band Q and not U 's song `` Fever Sleeves '' from their debut album No Kill No Beep Beep .
Smith had `` been holding onto that bit of inspiration for 10 years . ''
