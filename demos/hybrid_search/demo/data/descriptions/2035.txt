This is the third part of the Murder trilogy .
The first song was not released until 2007 and is called `` Leave The Bourbon On The Shelf , '' and the second song is `` Midnight Show , '' which is the tenth track on the album .
In this song , the murderer is being interrogated by police .
-LRB- thanks , Bryan - Bismarck , ND -RRB- The band have a number of songs that they wrote together in their early days , which even though they quite fond of , they were unable to complete .
This was one of them , but fortunately they were eventually able to salvage it : Flowers recalled to the American Songwriter magazine : `` We had the verse forever , and we knew in our hearts that it was good .
But we wondered if we 'd ever get past that verse .
And then the day came where -LRB- bassist -RRB- Mark -LRB- Stoermer -RRB- started playing the chorus .
And it could have been anybody .
Because we 're able to work together like that it helps us to avoid being stuck a lot of the time . ''
