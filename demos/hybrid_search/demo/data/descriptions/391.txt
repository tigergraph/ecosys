The American Metalcore band Killswitch Engage close Disarm the Descent with this cut , which sums up the album and contains elements of all of the songs leading up to it .
Vocalist Jesse Leach told Artist Direct : `` I wanted it to be the last song because I felt it summed up the whole thing .
Life is too short .
Do n't waste your time .
We sat and listened to all of the songs .
We all agreed this was a great order for the album . ''
