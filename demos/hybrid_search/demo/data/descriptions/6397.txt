This song about a relationship hurtling towards disintegration was originally the title track of Haim 's debut EP , and was the song that got the world all excited about the three sisters in the first place .
Released as their debut single , it peaked at # 75 on the UK singles chart .
This was produced by Ludwig Göransson , a Swedish composer who has helmed the music for the US TV sitcoms Community , Happy Endings , and New Girl , as well as the film Fruitvale Station .
Göransson manned the boards on Haim debut EP and helped establish the band with a brand new sound on this song .
Este Haim commented to VH1 just before the release of Days Are Gone : `` Listening back to that song , it 's the first time we heard a song we recorded and did n't cringe .
At the time , we had recorded a million songs and hated all of them .
This was the first time we recorded something that we were really proud of . ''
