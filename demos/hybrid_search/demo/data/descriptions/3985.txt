A lyrically dissonant song combining melancholy lyrics with an upbeat tune , it was written by their lead singer Chris Henderson .
`` I grew up near the water and ocean metaphors are always creeping into my subconscious , '' he told us .
`` To me the ocean is something that always moves ; even if it seems to be a still day , the tides are always moving .
A ` Broken Ocean ' obviously does n't exist , but if it did I would picture it to be stagnant and motionless .
There are days that I think we all feel stagnant in one way or another .
It 's possible that some of the upbeat and fun vibes you are hearing may be a suggested sense of optimism in a somewhat dismal topic . ''
