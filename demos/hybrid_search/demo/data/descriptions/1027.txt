Laffy Taffy is a kind of chewy candy .
The song is a series of candy references that are stretched into metaphors for sex and a woman 's body .
D4L was n't the first to explore the naughty side of seemingly innocent candy : 50 Cent had a hit in 2005 with the sweet and sexual `` Candy Shop . ''
The `` Candy Girl '' line is taken from the New Edition song of the same name .
D4L are 4 rappers from Atlanta .
Their name stands for `` Down For Life . ''
This was designed as a ringtone and released that way before it was a single .
The simple , tinny beat plays very well on cellphones , and exposure as a ringtone helped the song become a hit .
At the time , this became the most legally downloaded single ever .
