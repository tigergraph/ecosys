Hawthorne sings about his father on this Pharrell Williams produced track .
He described it to Radio.com as `` by far the hardest song -LSB- I 've -RSB- ever had to write . ''
Hawthorne added : `` I have to thank Pharrell Williams for pushing me to get the whole story out .
That was a toughie for me .
It 's a very emotional story .
Richard is my dad .
I still tear up thinking about that song sometimes , it 's a tough one .
It was so close to me that I did n't even know if I could put it on the album .
Pharrell called me every day and said , ` You have to put that song on the album . '
I caved and put it on there and I 'm glad I did . ''
