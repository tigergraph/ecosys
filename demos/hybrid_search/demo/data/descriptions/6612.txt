All four members of Little Big Town contribute to the songwriting process and are credited on the tracks , often along with their producer , Wayne Kirkpatrick .
`` All The Way Down '' was the brainchild of band member Phillip Sweet , who told us : `` We were writing one day over at Wayne 's studio and just being creative and the song came to mind .
The song we were trying to write just was n't hitting us or something .
So I had a lull in the thought process and I had this idea .
And I grabbed the guitar and I said , ` Hang on , I 'll be back . '
And I went out into another room and just sang this melody into my phone .
And I had , ` Going down , down , all the way down . '
Just had that idea , just felt like a good , easy-feeling slow song .
And I came back into the room and it was like , ` Hey , what do you all think about this ? '
And they lit up .
And it came out really fast in that afternoon.So we stopped what we were doing on one song , I came in with this idea , and we started working on ` All The Way Down ' and just fell in love with it .
It was one of our favorite ones we wrote towards the end .
And it 's still in that same kind of vibe of ` The Reason Why , ' because we had written them really close to each other as far as the emotional context , of falling in love and being in love and how good that is.We tend to write dark and moody songs , and this -LRB- The Reason Why -RRB- is our chance to just be lighthearted and feel good , and we love that .
That 's a side of us , too .
That 's who we are .
There 's just a real deep well of emotional content we can go and explore , because there 's four of us and we 're all human and we 're not always in the same place in our lives .
But it just so happens that we 're all sharing this feel-good journey moment along this journey together .
It 's just been really cool . ''
