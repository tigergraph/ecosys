Chesney explained to Billboard magazine the message behind this Scotty Emerick , Paul Overstreet and Even Stevens penned song : '' ` Round and Round ' is very different for me , melodically and production-wise .
I think everybody , whether it 's your job or your love life , whatever it is , there 's a certain complacency that we get , the internal voice saying it might be better somewhere else , or I 'm kinda sick of what I 'm doing now I might want to try this or that .
This song is telling us we should enjoy the right now , enjoy the moment .
I think everybody searches for that certain balance and tries to quiet those thoughts in their head that they 've got to be constantly moving , need to go somewhere , do this , be with somebody else .
It 's like all those characters in the song .
The guy that lives in the mountains wants to go to the beach and the guy on the beach wants to live in the mountains .
The message of the song is you 've got to enjoy the moment as much as you possible can . ''
Co-writer Paul Overstreet is the father of Glee cast member Chord Overstreet , who portrays transfer student Sam Evans .
Her vocals feature prominently on the cast 's version of Travie McCoy 's hit single `` Billionaire . ''
