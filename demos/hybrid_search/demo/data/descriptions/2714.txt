I Am Kloot are an English band formed in Manchester in 1999 by vocalist and guitarist John Bramwell , bassist Peter Jobson and drummer Andy Hargreaves .
This is a track from their fifth album , Sky At Night , which was co-produced by Elbow 's Guy Garvey and Craig Potter .
The album is loosely themed around late-night drinking and this song deals in fictional form with a couple of drinking establishments frequented by Kloot and Elbow .
Bramwell told The Guardian : `` If one song set the mood -LRB- for the album -RRB- it was ` To the Brink ' .
`` Hargreaves added : `` That set the mood that it was going to be a late-night , smoky vibe . ''
