This is a track from Country singer Carrie Underwood 's third studio album , Play On .
Underwood explained in publicity materials that this song , `` is kind of mean in that you 're telling this person you wish you 'd never met them .
That means I wish I 'd never met you .
My life was so much better before you and I wish I could take all that back . ''
CMT News asked Underwood about the dynamic when four people write together .
She replied : `` That was my first time writing with four people .
It 's really important to get the dynamic right .
I 'd met Kara DioGuardi for the first time writing with her .
Marty Fredrickson has a huge list of lots of different types of music going on .
And Luke Laird , I 've known forever and , I absolutely love him .
So getting the four of us in there , I feel like we all had our own thing .
Two amazing songs , and other songs that did n't quite make the album , came out of that session .
It worked out wonderfully .
I would love to write with the three of them again . ''
Underwood told The Boot that the songwriters ' idea for the hook came almost accidentally .
`` The guys had their guitars and they were playing something kind of bluesy , and Kara 's got such a great R&B sense about her , '' she explained .
`` And I started , ` Na , na , na-ing ' to whatever they were playing .
And they were like , ` What if that was the hook ? '
I said , ` Aw , I do n't know ? '
And before you knew it , we had ` Uh , uh , uh undo it . '
I mean , who would have thought ?
How do you write that down on paper ?
It was something that it did n't take that long to write and it 's so much fun to sing on stage , and people get into it .
If you listen to it twice , you know all the words !
We had a lot of fun with it . ''
The four songwriters wrote both this tune and `` Mama 's Song '' on the same day .
DioGuardi recalled to Billboard magazine : `` It was the craziest session I 've ever had .
To write two songs in five hours that both charted was ridiculous . ''
This mid-tempo number was written by Underwood together with Kara DioGuardi , Martin Frederiksen and Luke Laird .
Lyrically the song enters angry-with-a-fella territory , a theme that the American Idol winner has covered before on such tracks as `` Before He Cheats '' and `` Cowboy Casanova . ''
Underwood commented to The Associated Press on this spurned love song : `` I like to be sassy .
I 'm a smart aleck and it 's just fun to have a little sass . ''
DioGuardi 's influence can be heard in the little stutter vocal in the chorus - `` I wan na uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it . ''
`` I love na-na-nas , '' Underwood told USA Today .
`` I 'll put 'em in every song , if you do n't watch me . ''
Carrie Underwood achieved her 10th country # 1 when this jumped from 2-1 on the chart dated July 31 , 2010 .
