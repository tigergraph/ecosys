This song is about the urban paranoia of terrorism , which Kelly Jones witnessed after the July 7 terrorist bombings , which killed 52 people in London .
He recalls in The Sun newspaper October 12 , 2007 : `` We were in America at the time and we could see people trying to phone home and they could n't get hold of the people they wanted to .
You start to appreciate friends and family a lot more in life and we were like everyone else , and wanted to be with the people we loved . ''
