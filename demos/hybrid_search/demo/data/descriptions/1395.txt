Live life day by day is the message of this Zac Maloy , Rachel Proctor and David Hodges written song .
Lauren told Taste of Country she thinks its `` cool . ''
as `` it has a completely different vibe than all of the other songs .
It 's almost like it 's a sad song , but it 's also happy at the same time .
`` She added : `` It has a great message .
It 's the kind of song that makes you want to cry .
It says do n't worry about the small things , things that have happened in the past or what you think might happen tomorrow .
All that matters is what happens right now .
That message really appealed to me because crazy things have happened to me in the last year .
I think it 's a song that people can relate to no matter what point you are at in your life .
It tells you to take each day and make it last .
You have to live day by day and you ca n't worry about tomorrow .
I forget that a lot and I feel like other people do too .
It 's a good reminder . ''
