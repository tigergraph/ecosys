Singer/Guitarist Martin Johnson explained : `` This song brings you back to the beginning of the record .
Starting over , moving on , running away .
I have the hardest time sticking to things .
I constantly re-invent myself and push my focus in different directions .
This song kind of lays my erratic personality on the table ... sort of as a ` take it or leave it . '
And then it starts all over . ''
