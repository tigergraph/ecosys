This is the title track from the tenth studio album by English musician David Bowie .
It is notable as the vehicle for Bowie 's last great `` character , '' The Thin White Duke .
The only memory Bowie has of making the album is of ordering lead guitarist Earl Slick to play and repeat a Chuck Berry riff over the opening bars of this track .
`` I have only flashes of making it , '' a saner Bowie said much later .
`` I have serious problems about that year or two .
I ca n't remember how I felt ; I have no emotional geography . ''
This is Bowie 's longest studio recording , clocking in at 10 minutes and 11 seconds .
For a full minute , sampled locomotives clatter from speaker to speaker and the coke-deranged singer makes his entrance at 3:17 .
During the sessions for Station To Station , Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs , especially cocaine , and recalls almost nothing of the production .
He once joked , `` I know it was recorded in LA because I read it was . ''
The song is a 10-minute trip in four movements and the lyrics reflect Bowie 's preoccupations with the influential occultist Aleister Crowley , Hermetic Qabalah , the stations of the Cross and Gnosticism .
The Station To Station album was recorded after Bowie completed shooting Nicolas Roeg 's The Man Who Fell To Earth , and the cover features a still from the movie .
