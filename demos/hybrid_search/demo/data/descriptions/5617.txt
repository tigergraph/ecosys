This song talks about a relationship that did n't work out , but in the beginning it was good : `` You brought me into your heart and you swallow my pride . ''
At some point , there were left unsaid : `` I had a feeling you were hiding your thoughts , '' but it does n't end well : `` terrible realm ... chained to the helm , '' and the devastation reveals itself .
