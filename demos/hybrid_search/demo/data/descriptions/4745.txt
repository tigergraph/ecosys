This is a `` confession '' of Jim Morrison 's aims in life .
To the end of the night was his aim through many ways of speeding up death , a kind of death through hallucinations and visions into other worlds -LRB- drugs -RRB- .
He was trying to get somewhere nobody had ever been before , a place of complete peace .
-LRB- thanks , scarlett - winchester , England -RRB- The line , `` Realms of bliss , realms of light , some are borne to sweet delight , some are borne to sweet delight , some are borne to the endless night . ''
is taken almost verbatim from the poem Auguries Of Innocence by William Blake .
-LRB- thanks , max - geneva , IL -RRB- This was released as the B-side of `` Break on Through . ''
Some of the lyrics were inspired by the French novel Journey To The End Of The Night .
This helped The Doors get a record deal .
They included it on a demo they made for Aura Records in 1965 .
It did n't get them signed , but they landed a deal with Electra 2 years later .
