This is the title track and lead single from American country music artist Toby Keith 's fourteenth studio album .
Keith told Billboard that the song , `` makes fun of all the wackiness that goes on in this country . ''
Keith told Country Forever that this is a song of the times .
He explained : `` All it does is give you an entire list , a laundry list of all the things you see on TV , from Y2K , to Sars to Swine flu , to aliens coming across the border .
From what 's going on on American Idol to what 's going on in the reality shows to Michael Jackson dying , just on and on , but I love my American Ride kind of thing . ''
Pahanish and West also penned , together with Tim Johnson , Jimmy Wayne 's country # 1 , `` Do You Believe Me Now . ''
This song was penned by Joe West and Dave Pahanish and was titled `` American Life , '' when it was submitted to Keith .
He recalled to Billboard magazine : `` They sent it to me to listen to and said ` You 're the only guy in the world that could get away with cutting it . '
I held it for about a year ; it was so different I thought I 'd be tired of it .
I just left it on my iPod and kept listening to it , and it never got old . ''
Keith added : `` I 've only ever done , like , four or five songs in 16 albums that I did n't write , and this one sounds like I wrote it . ''
Here 's some chart trivia for this song : This was Keith 's 19th career # 1 on the Country singles chart and his 16th since 2000 , the most among all artists in the 21st century.It was the country singer 's third chart-topper with `` America '' in its title , the other two being `` Courtesy Of The Red , White And Blue -LRB- The Angry American -RRB- '' in 2002 and 2004 's `` American Soldier .
`` Coincidentally the song toppled another `` American '' song from the chart 's pinnacle - Justin Moore 's # 1 single `` Small Town U.S.A. . ''
West and Pahanish told AOL 's The Boot the story behind the song : Pahanish : `` It 's kind of written in the way that Bob Dylan would have written ` Subterranean Homesick Blues . '
Joe and I just put down a laundry list of things that would personally irritate us .
We would find ourselves talking about something and saying , ` What about what happened this time ? '
or ` Can you believe that so and so happened ? '
`` West : `` And some of it we were n't really sure had happened .
We started writing the song about the time we had seen that video on YouTube about that girl getting beaten up by her friends , and then the movie Mean Girls came out .
It was just a lot of topical stuff .
I never felt like the song was saying right or wrong , but absurdity or just wild .
One of the things we heard was this comedian saying , ` Why are kids in the Sudan not lactose intolerant like American kids are ? '
Because of our culture , we have a whole sort of problems that other cultures do n't .
So you could say we 're celebrating the absurdity .
`` West : `` The great thing about it is , we did n't write it for Toby Keith ; it was just a funny song , and an entertaining song .
We took Dave over to ShowDog -LRB- Toby 's label -RRB- to play for Allison Jones to get a record deal for Dave .
We ended up playing the song for her .
`` Pahanish : `` We told Allison the only person capable of pulling off a song like this was Toby Keith .
He 's the only artist who would have the inertia and size to do it .
`` West : `` I 'd always heard that Toby had two iPods : one for business and one for pleasure .
We heard that we were on both of them !
So I guess we crossed over with Toby !
He had it a long time , and then one day they called and said he was going to cut the song .
Within a week of that phone call , he was doing it live in concert .
Then we heard he was going to do a video , and I was n't actually sure he understood everything about the song .
But you can see , play by play , he had ever single thing down .
It might not be as cryptic as we thought it would be , but when you look at the video it is even more so .
`` Pahanish : `` My publisher called me and said , ` Toby wants to talk with you .
He wants to know if he can change ` American Life ' to ` American Ride , ' which is I guess what he heard me singing on the demo .
I said , ` Are you kidding ?
He can call it ` Cotton Candy Surprise , ' if he 'll just record it and put it on the radio ! ''
