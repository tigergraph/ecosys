Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor wrote the lyrics to this song as a tribute to Led Zeppelin .
The orchestra in the middle part was completely done with synthesizers ; by Freddie Mercury and the producer David Richards .
This was Queen 's third # 1 in the UK after `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' and `` Under Pressure . ''
-LRB- thanks , Paul - Redditch , England -RRB- The music was started off by Brian May , Roger Taylor and John Deacon jamming in the studio in Montreux .
From then on Freddie Mercury composed the song and added the long interlude .
The melody is Mercury 's as well .
Lyrics were started off by Mercury but completed by drummer Roger Taylor .
Yes guitarist Steve Howe played the Spanish guitar solo in the middle because , admittedly , Brian May could n't do it .
Steve dropped by in the studio to say hi to producer David Richards , then Freddie invited him to join them on the track .
-LRB- thanks , sebas - Tokyo , Japan , for all above -RRB- Chris Daughtry performed this song on the fifth season of American Idol .
Simon Cowell called his performance `` indulgent '' and asked why he did n't sing one of the great Queen songs instead .
