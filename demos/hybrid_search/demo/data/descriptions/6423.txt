This song talks about Jesus looking for you to look into his eyes .
Most people will not look into his eyes so they can live a life of sin .
Lead singer Christian Lindskog : `` The song is about sin and how we deal with it and in that sense the crucifixion of Jesus enters into it because that is how God dealt with our sin . ''
