This is a track from Reggie , the tenth studio album from rapper Redman .
The title refers to Redman 's birth name , Reggie Noble .
Redman stated in an interview with Spin magazine that the album is more conceptual than his previous releases .
He explained : `` I address different things than I would on a typical Redman album .
I 'm not political , but I touch a couple of bases , more than what Redman would normally do .
For example , I 've got a song called ` Mic , Lights , Camera , Action . '
In the second verse I 'm picturing myself protecting President Obama .
What can we do to protect our first black president ?
What can we do so he does n't become a statistic , like Martin Luther King Jr. ? ''
