Nas 's ex-fianc√©e Carmen Bryan gave birth to their daughter , Destiny , in 1994 and on this song , the Queensbridge-raised MC raps some heartfelt verses about his teenage girl .
They include some rhymes addressing the time back in February 2012 when Destiny posted a photo on Twitter showcasing a box filled with Trojan condoms .
`` She planted a box of condoms on her dresser then she Instagram-ed it , '' he spits .
`` At this point I realized I ai n't the strictest parent . ''
So what was Carmen Bryan 's response to Destiny 's father 's song .
`` Just heard ` Daughters ' by Nas .
What a disappointment !
He had nothing positive to say about our daughter and his depiction of her is false , '' she wrote on Twitter after its online release .
The song 's music video was directed by Chris Robinson -LRB- Lil Wayne 's `` How To Love '' Rick Ross ' `` Touch 'N You '' -RRB- and it chronicles their daddy-daughter relationship through her eyes .
`` Right off the bat , he really loved the idea of the P.O.V. , '' Robinson , told MTV News .
This is n't the first time Nas has rapped about Destiny .
He first referenced his daughter soon after she arrived in this world on the 1994 song , `` The World Is Yours . ''
Nas then sang of `` daddy 's little girl '' on `` Me & You -LRB- Dedicated to Destiny -RRB- , '' a track from his 2004 double album , Street 's Disciple .
The ode to fatherhood was produced by renowned Chicago beatmaker No I.D. who has also worked with Kanye West , Jay-Z and Common .
Rather than casting an actress to play his daughter , Nas persuaded the director to let Destiny play herself .
`` I think that this song for Nas is so personal , everything in the song is real , that he wanted to share this moment with his fans , with the world , and it was actually his suggestion , '' Robinson revealed to MTV News .
`` I was ready to cast someone , and he was real calm and said , ` Hey , Dest is gon na be here , I think we need to keep it real . ' ''
