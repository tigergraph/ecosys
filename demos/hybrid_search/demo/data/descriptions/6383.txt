Morrison told The Sun September 25 , 2008 about this song , which was inspired by his long-term girlfriend Gill : `` I was in LA and had met a few idiot women .
I just thought , ` You might be good looking but you are nothing on my girlfriend . '
She has got everything that is good about a person .
Yes I would flirt a bit but that was it .
I just felt that this whole time I have someone who is amazing .
We 've been together seven years and I could n't wait to get home . ''
