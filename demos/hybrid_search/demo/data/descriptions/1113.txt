This is the only track on Imaginaerum that Nightwish keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen penned with bassist-vocalist Marco Hietala .
Speaking on a track-by-track video , Holopainen pointed out that it 's `` kind of funny that the most poppy song on the album is composed by the most metalhead dude in the band . ''
The song 's lyrics were inspired by American author Henry David Thoreau 's book Walden , which is a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings .
Holopainen admitted to Metal Hammer magazine : `` I have to admit it 's a bit of a rip-off , because I 'm a big fan of Henry David Thoreau , the poet from the 19th Century .
I read his book ` Walden ' , where he said , ' I do n't care about the love , the beauty , the pride or anything , just give me the truth .
I thought there was a big philosophy behind that , and I started to think I could make a song about it .
The crowd represents pride , the owl wisdom and the dove love and peace . ''
