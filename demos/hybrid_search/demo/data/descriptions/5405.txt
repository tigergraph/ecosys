When Sara originally sent the track out to her sister and producer Greg Kurstin , it was much more acoustic and very slow .
Tegan told Under The Radar : `` I was haunted by it almost immediately .
I found the verses to be quintessential Sara .
The line about standing in the shadow of a damaged heart , I was just like , ` Are you fu -- ing kidding me ? '
She 's so good .
She has this way of creating this devastating imagery.In the past , where it was a love song , ` I 'm Not Your Hero ' is much more about feeling alienated and lost and lonely amongst your peers , '' she continued .
`` There have been times especially in the last few years where Sara and I , but mainly Sara , have felt very alone .
Not only because we 're so political and so outspoken , but also because we can fit into a lot of different places .
Specifically , we 've been embraced and accepted in a lot of mainstream ways , and sometimes I think that makes us feel alienated from our gay community or the indie rock community .
So , I think it 's a really powerful song about feeling alienated amongst your people . ''
