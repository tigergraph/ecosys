This is a track from Intimacy : Album III , the third studio album by American R&B artist Kem .
The `` Intimacy '' title indicates the set 's theme , though Kem told Billboard it 's not just about sexual and romantic intimacy .
`` Intimacy is allowing yourself to really be yourself in front of another individual and allowing them to do the same without any judgment , '' he explained .
`` We 're talking about relationships between lovers , between friends ... spiritual intimacy between ourselves and our creator .
There 's a song called ` Mother 's Love ' which is talking about maternal intimacy .
We go a little bit deeper into those things on this record . ''
