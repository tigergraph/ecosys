Flo Rida explained to Billboard magazine that this song , `` talks about different things I 've been through , from growing up in the ghetto and being around people who sell drugs to keeping my eyes on the prize , believing in God and being obedient . ''
Much of the album was recorded in a hotel bedroom .
Flo Rida explained to The Sun March 11 , 2009 : `` During the making of the album we were so busy and a lot of it needed to be done on the road in the hotel .
We 'd set up a studio in the bedroom and do some recording in the bathroom .
We had to pad it with towels to get acoustics right .
We had to be careful with the water as we did n't want any electrical problems ! ''
The album title is an acronym for `` Route Of Overcoming The Struggle . ''
Flo Rida explained to ShockHound : `` I wanted to go back to my roots and show people where I come from , what I stand for , how I got success and what I do to sustain it .
At the same time , I was just as inspired by the chance I recently had to go to Africa for the MTV Awards in Abuja , Nigeria .
I received an award , and I opened and closed the show .
Prior to that , I was thinking about the different struggles that those people go through .
I also have my own struggles , and I wanted those to come across on this album . ''
