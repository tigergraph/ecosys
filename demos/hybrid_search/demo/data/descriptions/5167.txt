Up to this point , most of Hendrix ' songs were about spirituality or love .
This was a change of direction , as the song is told from the perspective of a soldier trapped in a war .
The song was inspired by The Vietnam War , the Black Panther Party , and the business struggles Hendrix was dealing with .
Hendrix introduced this song by dedicating it to `` All the troops fighting in Harlem , Chicago and , oh yes , Vietnam . ''
A studio version was never released , but Hendrix did perform this live a few times , first in September , 1969 on The Dick Cavett Show .
The performances could last up to 20 minutes , and the lyrics were different every time .
When Hendrix performed at Woodstock , he played the intro to this song at the beginning of `` Hear My Train A Comin ' . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France , for above 3 -RRB- Hendrix had parted ways with his group The Jimi Hendrix Experience and recorded this with his new group , The Band Of Gypsys , which included Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums .
The album Band Of Gypsys was recorded live at The Fillmore East in New York City on New Year 's Day , 1970 .
Hendrix needed one more album to fulfill his contract with Capitol Records , and decided a live album would be the easiest way to do so .
When Hendrix sings , `` I pick up my axe and fight like a bomber , '' his `` Axe '' is his guitar -LRB- as it 's commonly known in England -RRB- .
Hendrix used a Univibe Pedal to get the sound at the beginning of the song , which is supposed to mimic a machine gun .
