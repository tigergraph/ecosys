This was the lead single from Grace/Wastelands .
Lyrically this song transports the listener to a romanticized world of English roses who `` could charm the bees ' knees off the bees . ''
However , musically it is an un-Doherty-like take on reggae .
Doherty told the NME March 21 , 2009 : `` I never thought people would like this .
Stephen -LRB- Street -RRB- just took a loop from a demo where I had my mobile phone in the vocal booth . ''
At the end of this song , Doherty recites in French lines from Jean Genet 's 1943 poetic novel Our Lady of the Flowers .
Other tunes that refer to Genet 's novel include The Pogues ' 1990 song `` Hell 's Ditch '' and Placebo 's 1996 number `` Lady of the Flowers . ''
Blur 's Graham Coxon plays guitar on this song and the rest of the album apart from `` Broken Love Song . ''
Doherty told the NME January 17 , 2009 : `` I do n't know how Graham ended up on the album .
I suppose it was jobs for the boys . ''
Producer Stephen Street has also helmed some of Blur 's material .
This contains the line : `` With your famous Auntie Arthur 's trousers on . ''
Doherty told Clash Magazine Issue 34 that characters such as the one in this song are based on real people .
He explained : `` This is the one thing about this album ; it 's not a fairy story , you know ?
It 's quite descriptive and it 's quite honest in its descriptions , even down to `` Auntie Arthur 's trousers '' - the whole thing is dead personal and dead true to life .
Maybe we should have a little clause at the front : ` Any resemblance to persons living , past or present , is intentional ' . ''
