This was released as the lead single from the soundtrack to the Baz Lurhmann-directed movie , The Great Gatsby .
Lana Del Rey wrote the song with San Francisco songwriter Rick Nowels , whose other credits include Belinda Carlisle 's `` Heaven Is A Place on Earth , '' Dido 's `` White Flag '' and Colbie Caillat 's `` Fallin ' For You . ''
Del Rey said , `` It was an honor to work with Baz Lurhmann on his amazing adaptation of one of the most extraordinary books ever written .
The movie is highly glamorous and exciting ; Rick Nowels and I were thrilled to write the song for the film . ''
This song is suited to Del Rey , as she can sing it in a very low register .
`` She has this beautiful deep speaking voice , '' her former vocal coach Tina Shafer told us .
`` So she 's written tailor-made a lot of her songs around a comfortable speaking voice area of her voice . ''
The Music from Baz Luhrmann 's Film The Great Gatsby soundtrack blends traditional Jazz with Hip-Hop and other contemporary musical textures . ''
-LSB- The idea -RSB- did n't come from ` Let 's make a great soundtrack , it came from Fitzgerald , ' '' Luhrmann explained to MTV News .
`` When he wrote that book , he was a modernist , he was in the moment , and the music of the moment was African-American street music called Jazz , and when he put Jazz music in Gatsby , everyone was like ` What are you crazy ?
It 's a fad . '
And then he put Hit Parade songs , pop songs , the equivalent of Lana Del Rey singing a beautiful ballad . ''
This started out as a different song before Baz Luhrmann got to hear it .
Del Rey told Radio.com : `` He asked me if I could I write a memory cue for Daisy .
So I sang him a chorus of ` Young and Beautiful ' that I had already -- just a chorus -- and he thought that 'd be good for her .
I wrote the whole thing after I watched her garden scenes . ''
