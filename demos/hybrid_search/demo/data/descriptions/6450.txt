A bonus track on the Dark Light album , lead singer Ville Valo explained : `` In some old myth , the 7 towers and the water in the ocean are Hell - that 's in the chorus of the song .
In a way , it 's a song about a young person who should n't be taught and subjected to religion , but who should instead figure out things in their own mind .
And it 's not necessarily just about religion - it could be about world politics as well .
And of course , there are secrets in that song that I wo n't reveal . ''
