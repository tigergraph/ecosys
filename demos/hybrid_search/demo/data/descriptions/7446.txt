The title track of Parachute 's third album finds Will Anderson singing about being unable to sleep because he 's infatuated with a love interest .
He declares desperately , `` I ca n't get over you overnight , '' accompanied by a pounding kick drum . ''
` Overnight ' is one of our favorite songs on the album , '' Anderson told Billboard magazine .
`` We feel it captures the essence of the whole record in one song , and enough so to make us name the whole album after it .
It was easy to write , a lot of fun to record . ''
