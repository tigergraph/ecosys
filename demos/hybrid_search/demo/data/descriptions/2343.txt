This is Ronnie Van Zant 's protest song .
Instead of writing from the perspective of the war , it is written from the perspective of the government .
This song , track one , side two , of their debut album -LRB- pronounced ` lĕh - ` nérd ` skin - ` nérd -RRB- , was part of Lynyrd Skynyrd 's initial audition tapes .
Then-producer Al Kooper brought them all into the studio to record every original song they knew to live-to-two-track , so he could then pick and choose from that to make the first album .
However , it turned out that all 14 songs were top-notch , so Kooper used everything that did n't go on the first album for either B-sides for single 's releases or on later albums.Kooper 's initial work with the band was sometimes a power struggle .
In his memoir , Backstage Passes and Backstabbing Bastards , Kooper mentions how they broke in Billy Powell , a keyboardist with training in classical music .
While the classical music training gave him a rich , textured sound , he tended to play too much with his left hand , drowning out the guitars .
Kooper got so frustrated trying to break him of this habit that he took to tying Powell 's left hand to the piano bench during takes !
An acoustic version of this song is featured on the album Endangered Species sung by Johnny Van Zant .
