Multi Grammy Award winning legends Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis produced this track , which is from British soul and R&B singer Beverley Knight 's sixth studio album , 100 % .
She gushed to The Daily Mirror September 4 , 2009 : `` Extraordinary guys .
They were very down to earth and they knew how to wring the best vocal performance out of me .
They knew when less was more .
When I sang ` Every Step , ' Terry said , ` That was great , but now sing it with a smile . '
I was happy and relaxed , but he meant an actual physical smile , which pulls out different tones in my voice .
No one ever told me that before or worked with me like that before .
I was exhausted by the end of it , but it was an amazing experience . ''
This song was released as a free download on July 6 , 2009 for two weeks .
