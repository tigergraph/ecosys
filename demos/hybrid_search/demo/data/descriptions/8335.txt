This was written in the rarely used 5/4 time signature .
Chris Cornell stated in a YouTube video that the track is `` a bit strange '' but sounded like `` a heavy straightforward rock song . ''
Probably the best known song written in a 5/4 meter is `` Take Five '' by The Dave Brubeck Quartet .
Dave Grohl directed the music video , having submitted a treatment on his own initiative after hearing the song .
The former Nirvana drummer was a part of the same Seattle grunge scene that Soundgarden emerged from in the early 1990s .
The clip casts the band as a Segway-driving biker gang and features a special cameo by Canadian progressive house producer , Deadmau5 , as a cop who arrests Cornell .
