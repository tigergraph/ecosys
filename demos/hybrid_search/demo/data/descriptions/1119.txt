This is the title track of Joe Jonas ' debut solo album .
The music that the Jonas Brothers star recorded for the record showed a new side to him , with songs about heartbreak and romantic turmoil rather than the songs about puppy love he recorded with Nick and Kevin .
Speaking to MTV News , Joe explained the thinking behind his debut album title : `` I think my life has been so crazy busy for the past year and a half , and I kind of wanted to show people a little bit more of what my life is about , bring them into it a little bit more , so that 's been a fun experience , '' he said .
Musically it is different too , with R&B and dance tracks influenced by artists such as Chris Brown .
`` A song I 'm most excited about right now is a song called ` FastLife . '
Performing it live is so much fun , '' Joe told MTV News .
`` Doing a lot of dancing and stuff , it 's cool for people to see ; it 's a little bit different .
It 's fun for me to be up there doing it .
I feel like it 's a fun dance song .
A lot of people want to have fun listening to it and dancing to it , '' he continued .
`` The song is just about pretty much living life to the fullest , enjoying life , going out with your friends and having fun . ''
Regarding the album cover , Joe explained to MTV News : `` We had a couple of photo shoots trying to decide which direction we wanted to go in .
And it just kind of came together with having a really cool background and explaining Fast Life . ''
