Clarkson wrote this eerie song four or five years prior to recording it on the My December album .
Clarkson explained on her record label 's website about this song concerning someone she grew up with that committed suicide : `` I was expressing my anger at how someone could do that .
Why would you leave all these people behind feeling guilty and wondering what they could have done to prevent it ?
I really believe that God puts us through these situations to help others . ''
