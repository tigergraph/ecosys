Angello revealed to MTV News how their two collaborations came to be .
`` We did the -LSB- 2010 American Music Awards performance -RSB- with Usher , '' he said .

-LSB- After that -RSB- we were in Atlanta and we were all working together for five days .
And then we brainstormed and wrote the records from start to finish . ''
