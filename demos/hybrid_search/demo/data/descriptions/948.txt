Georgia born and raised Tyler Hubbard and Florida native Brian Kelley both began playing guitar individually while they were in high school before meeting at Nashville 's Belmont University .
They began writing songs together between classes and soon found themselves playing local clubs , quickly building a fanbase .
Hubbard and Kelley signed a publishing/production/management deal with Craig Wiseman 's Big Loud Mountain record label in December 2011 and released their first five-song EP , It ' z Just What We Do the following May .
This breezy summer song is their first single from the collection .
When this tale of youthful attraction , music and Georgia back roads topped Billboard 's Country airplay , Florida Georgia Line became the first duo or group to reach # 1 on the chart with a debut single since Zac Brown Band 's `` Chicken Fried '' in December 2008 .
This song found a home on Pop radio playlists alongside far more kinetic fare by the likes of Icona Pop , Robin Thicke , and Maroon 5 .
Part of its appeal is its unabashedly Southern sentiments , as we hear about a beautiful girl who enjoys both The Marshall Tucker Band -LRB- `` Ca n't You See , '' `` Heard It In A Love Song '' -RRB- and Southern Comfort cocktails .
Unlike most hits of the time , the song forgoes an intro and starts right in with the chorus , which is repeated three more times in the song .
In the last verse , most of the musical backing is dropped , which adds provides a nice break near the end of the song and adds impact to that fourth chorus .
The song set the all-time record for the most weeks at # 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart -LRB- over three different runs -RRB- .
It overtook three other titles that each led for 21 weeks - Eddy Arnold 's `` I 'll Hold You in My Heart -LRB- 1947-48 -RRB- , Hank Snow 's `` I 'm Moving On '' -LRB- 1950-51 -RRB- and Webb Pierce 's `` In the Jailhouse Now '' -LRB- 1955 -RRB- .
The song finally abdicated the # 1 crown after a run of 24 cumulative weeks , the last 19 occurring over consecutive frames .
This was the first song that Florida Georgia Line wrote with producer Joey Moi -LRB- Nickelback , Jake Owen -RRB- .
The trio built on a tune that Hubbard and Kelley had already started with brothers Chase and Jesse Rice .
`` It was one of those days where everything was firing perfectly , '' Moi told Billboard magazine .
`` No one got hung up or was banging their head on the wall trying to find a word that rhymes with ` car . ' ''
The remixed version of the song took Single of the Year at the 2013 American Music Awards .
`` I 've got to thank my boy Nelly , '' said Tyler Hubbard .
`` Thank you for making this song epic for us .
It 's a huge honor . ''
The song 's success was predicted by Brian Kelley as soon as the pair started laying it down .
`` I remember first day in the studio when we were recording ` Cruise ' and it was starting to come to life , '' said Tyler as the song climbed the Hot 100 .
`` BK looked at me and he said , ` Dude , we 're gon na sell a million copies of this song . '
And I 'm like , ` Dude , there 's no way .
It 's not even possible . '
And you know , that was a year ago when we were starting to work on it . ''
The song left the Hot 100 in February 2013 , after peaking at # 16 .
However , after a Pop crossover remix with rapper Nelly was released a couple of months later , the song reappeared on the chart this time in the top 10 .
Brian Kelley of Florida Georgia Line explained to Radio.com how the collaboration with Nelly came together .
`` We had some pop stations that were wanting a different version of ` Cruise ' that we could send out , and he -LSB- Nelly -RSB- is a labelmate , '' he said .
`` We heard he was a fan of what we were doing and the song .
We knew he wanted to do it , and literally a day or two later we had the track and we cranked it up on the bus . ''
He added that the pair were blown away by Nelly 's version .
`` I literally think that whole weekend we probably listened to it a couple hundred times , '' he admitted .
`` We 're huge fans of him .
I do n't think we could have picked anybody better .
It fits what we 're doing , it fits what he 's doing .
He 's a country boy at heart .
We 're thankful that he put his amazing talent on our song . ''
This was n't the first time that Nelly had dipped his toe into the Nashville sound .
In 2004 he recorded a country-rap hybrid , `` Over and Over , '' with Tim McGraw , which peaked at # 3 on the Hot 100 .
The song climbed into the Hot 100 's top five in its 34th week on the chart , setting a record for the slowest ascent to the region in the chart 's history .
It eclipsed the 30-week ascent to the top five of Lonestar 's `` Amazed '' in 1999-2000 .
Imagine Dragons bested Florida Georgia Line 's longevity record just three weeks later when `` Radioactive '' climbed into the Hot 100 's top five for the first time in its 42nd week on the chart .
This won Single Of The Year at the 2013 CMA Awards .
Florida Georgia Line also won Vocal Duo Of The Year at the same ceremony .
NielsenSoundscan announced in early January 2014 that the song had overtaken Lady Antebellum 's `` Need You Now '' to become the # 1 best-selling digital Country single of all time .
