This was written in memory of Amy Winehouse 's pet canary , whom she named after movie star Ava Gardner .
Amy recalled to Mojo magazine January 2008 how the bird would wake her in the mornings , `` twittering away and rocking on her little swing . ''
When it died the singer was heartbroken .
She buried her beloved bird in some woods in East Finchley near London , singing `` Lullaby Of Birdland '' as she laid Ava to rest .
She added in the same Mojo interview : `` I loved that bird .
It was a sad time .
But I got a good song out of it . ''
The album Frank was named in reference to the singer Frank Sinatra , who was married to Ava Gardner between 1951 and 1957 .
