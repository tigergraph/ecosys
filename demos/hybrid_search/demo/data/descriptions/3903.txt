Guitarist Zoltan Bathory explained to Metal Hammer why the band recorded this instrumental track .
He explained : `` Funnily enough , it was Ivan -LSB- Moody , vocals -RSB- who really pushed for there to be an instrumental on the album !
He said that he just wanted to hear us play , to just shred it , so that 's what we did !
However , it 's not a typical instrumental in that we decided to retain a strong sense of structure , to still go down the verse/chorus route , only with the guitars doing the work . ''
Bathory added that the title comes from , `` the last round of the ninth circle of hell in Dante 's Inferno , and as this was the last track we worked on and the record was pretty much a journey through hell to make , lots of pressure , loads to do and not much time to do it in , we thought it highly appropriate ! ''
