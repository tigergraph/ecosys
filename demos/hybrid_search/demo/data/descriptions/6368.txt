`` Oh Nostalgia '' came ahead in the poll and was included on Stump 's debut EP Truant Wave , however , `` New Regrets '' was chosen for Soul Punk .

It was his label 's first release and was limited to 500 pressings .
During an interview with Broward Palm Beach New Times , Stump was asked what is the favorite lyric that he 's come up with for Soul Punk ?
He replied with a couplet from this song : `` Depression 's a little bit like happy hour , it 's always got ta be happening somewhere on any given night . ''
Stump then explained : `` It 's acknowledging that we all get , especially when you 're younger , it 's easy to dwell on these things , but as you get older and have actual real-life stuff happen to you , that 's when you get to know man problems , adult problems .
That makes you appreciate the good stuff a little bit more . ''
During the writing of Soul Punk , Stump had to deal with a number of difficult issues , including the deaths of both his uncle and his friend T-Bone Wolk .
He explained to MTV News that some of his writing `` took on a more cathartic thing , '' as he dealt with the tragedies and this song deals explicitly with his losses .
