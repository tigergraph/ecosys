This song is a response to Brand New 's song `` Seventy Times 7 . ''
Jessie Lacey of Brand New 's girlfriend cheated on him with John Nolan of Taking Back Sunday .
John called Jessie to tell him and Jessie said , `` Is that what you call tact ?
You 're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back .
So let 's end this call , and end this conversation . ''
That 's why these lyrics are in both of the songs .
The two have now made up and are friends again and even perform these two songs together .
