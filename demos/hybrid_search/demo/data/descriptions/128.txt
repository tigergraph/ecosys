Arriving back home from playing some festivals in Europe , frontman Andy Biersack sketched out a short story set in the future about a group of rebels battling a unified church government .
It was after a meeting with producer John Feldmann that the idea of making Black Veil Brides third set a concept album , based on his Orwellian storyline , was hatched .
`` I 've always been a big fan of utopian , future , new world stories - V For Vendetta , comic books , graphic novels , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` It 's not really an anti-religion story ; more than anything it 's based on the concept of the five of us in the band as these Che Guevara , rebellious leaders unified against this big church/government bad guy .
It became something that was really fun to write , and when we went to start working with John Feldman ... he started asking me , ` What 's going on in your life ?
What 's been inspiring you ? '
I told him I wrote this story and it expanded from there . ''
Accompanying Wretched & Divine is a film , Legion of the Black , which tells the visual story of the concept presented in the album .
