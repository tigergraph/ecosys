The Edge 's guitar is distorted through a Leslie speaker cabinet on this song .
Designed for organs , guitarists like Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton experimented with it in the '60s .
Drummer Larry Mullen thought this could have been a huge hit if they had time to finish it properly .
The album was rushed in order to meet deadlines .
The line `` Stuck together with God 's glue '' is the title of a 1991 album by Something Happens , another Dublin group who some thought would be the next U2 .
The bands knew each other well and it was considered a tribute .
U2 performed this live for the first time during the PopMart tour opener in Las Vegas on April 25 , 1997 .
It did n't go so well - the band stopped and re-started the song because not everyone was on the same tempo .
