This is the second single from British pop group Take That 's sixth studio album , Progress .
It was released to British radio on January 17 , 2011 .
Progress saw Robbie Williams being re-united with the other Take That members after a gap of over 15 years .
However , this song should not be confused with his duet with Kylie Minogue , `` Kids , '' which was a # 2 hit in the UK in 2000 .
The group were due to perform the song live on the December 13 , 2010 X Factor final .
However the dance routine featured protesters fighting with police with riot shields , forcing Simon Cowell to make the band switch to `` The Flood '' instead as there had been some quite violent student protests going on at the time .
