Kieren Webster -LRB- vocals/bass -RRB- -LRB- from The View Are On Fire -RRB- : `` That 's a song about how just cause you 're bored , you end up getting tempted .
It 's about the stuff that you do when you 're out .
The stuff that you regret the next day .
The line ` Once a broken promise on my bone ' -- I still ca n't move my hand 'cause I punched a wall when I was out , being stupid .
That was the temptation of bevvy .
You 've got to stop it .
` You 've got to change . '
Pete Reilly -LRB- guitar -RRB- loves his solo on that . ''
Kyle Falconer -LRB- vocals/guitar -RRB- recalled , `` I remember we wrote it all sat in a circle with a liter of Southern Comfort .
And every time we got to the end of the tune , we all had to do , like , a half pint or something .
We ended up scrapping . ''
