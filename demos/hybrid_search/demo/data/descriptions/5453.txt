Stevens got the lyrics from a hymn book he found at a bookstore while looking for song ideas .
It was a children 's hymn by Eleanor Farjeon , who also wrote a lot of children 's poetry .
Stevens explained on The Chris Isaak Hour : `` I accidentally fell upon the song when I was going through a slightly dry period and I needed another song or two for Teaser And The Firecat .
I came across this hymn book , found this one song , and thought , This is good .
I put the chords to it and then it started becoming associated with me . ''
Rick Wakeman , who later became a member of Yes , played keyboards .
He claims he was never paid for his work .
This song is set to a Scottish tune entitled `` Bunessan , '' a melody that was named for a small island town in Scotland .
-LRB- thanks , Annabelle - Eugene , OR -RRB- Children in England would have heard Farjeon 's hymn in primary school .
Scottish children sang the old Gaelic hymn , `` Child in a manger , Infant of Mary '' to this tune .
This hymn predated `` Morning '' and was written in Gaelic by Mary MacDonald before being translated into English .
For Scottish children it was a Christmas hymn .
-LRB- thanks , marjorie - san jose , CA -RRB- This was Stevens ' first single that did better in America than in England .
`` Peace Train '' and `` Wild World '' were not released in the US .
Neil Diamond recorded this in 1992 for his Christmas album -LRB- yes , Diamond is Jewish -RRB- .
His version went to # 36 in the UK .
