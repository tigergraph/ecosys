This song is written from the perspective of a nuclear weapon .
Polaris was a nuclear missile in the United States ' arsenal .
Dave Mustaine of Megadeth got the idea for the song after he went skydiving , and on the way home noticed a bumper sticker reading `` May all of your warheads rust in peace . ''
According to Mustaine , the dialog in the song is the missile speaking , saying things like `` Tremble you weaklings , cower in fear . ''
Said Mustaine : `` As soon as the f -- king thing detonates , it discharges nuclear fallout .
People think they can go underground and get away from it , but what happens when you come up .
It 's still there .
There is no safety . ''
The final song on Rust In Peace , this track is intended to be the climax , or as Mustaine calls it , the `` grand finale '' of the album .
There is no guitar solo on the track , just a few quick lead guitar notes in the beginning to set the mood .
