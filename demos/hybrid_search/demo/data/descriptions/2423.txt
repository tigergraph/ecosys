This documents what could be a quarrel between two lovers , or a prostitute and her client : `` When she said / ` Do n't waste your words , they 're just lies ' / I cried she was deaf . ''
The woman eventually kicks the man out of her house : `` She threw me outside/I stood in the dirt where ev'ry one walked . ''
He then comes back to pick up his shirt , and in her rage , the woman chokes on her gum , leaving the guy to snoop around : `` She screamed till her face got so red/Then she fell on the floor/And I covered her up and then/Thought I 'd go look through her drawer . ''
A live version of this song featured in the 2001 movie , Vanilla Sky , starring Tom Cruise .
Many believe this song was written in response to `` Norwegian Wood -LRB- This Bird Has Flown -RRB- '' by The Beatles , since it is similar , both melodically and lyrically .
John Lennon was unsure whether the song was a homage or a warning .
This is because the song concludes with an ambiguous final verse , where Dylan goes from the pronoun `` she , '' to instead address someone directly with the pronoun `` you . ''
This final verse contains the line `` I never asked for your crutch/Now do n't ask for mine . ''
John was concerned that Bob thought he was using Dylan 's music as a crutch for his own song writing .
Others argue this line is actually about the folk singer , Joan Baez , who had been close to Dylan in his early days and helped him to garner initial success .
Now , however , it was Baez who tended to rely on Dylan 's success .
Blonde on Blonde is Bob Dylan 's seventh studio album .
It is widely considered one of his greatest works .
In 2003 , the album was ranked at # 9 on Rolling Stone 's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .
