This is the first single and title track from Florida Metalcore band Trivium 's fifth studio voice .
The song was released on May 21 , 2011 to Trivium World members and onto the US iTunes store and Zune Marketplace on June 10 .
Nine days later the band performed the song live for the first time at their show in Birmingham , United Kingdom .
This song 's initial demo was brought to the band by bassist Paolo Gregoletto .
Singer Matt Heafy told Alternative Press : `` By this point , we had tracks like ` Built ' and ` Inception ' but nothing like ` In Waves . '
This song was the turning point for the album .
From that original demo and the many variations to come , we were able to branch off and create what eventually became the song .
This was intentionally displayed worldwide first to show people they were getting something unexpected . ''
