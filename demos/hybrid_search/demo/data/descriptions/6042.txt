This song finds MercyMe cutting loose , musically speaking .
Frontman Bart Millard told NewReleaseTuesday how this track came about : `` Well , that 's the kind of music we 'd warm up with at the studio and then we 'd settle down to do our power ballad .
One of our producers asked us why we were n't writing the kind of songs that sounded like the amazing , jamming music we were making warming up .
So we went down that road and just fell in love .
Our slower songs on the album are very recognizable because we do still love that kind of music , but out upbeat music of the past has had kind of lost its identity .
We just love pop music and it was just a blast to get permission to do it ; getting cut loose was so great . ''
