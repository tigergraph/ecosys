The third album by New York singer-songwriter Annie Clark , who records under the name of St. Vincent , was written in Seattle .
She decamped to the North Western city to escape from the information overload she was experiencing at home and recorded Strange Mercy in a studio provided by Death Cab For Cutie drummer Jason McGerr .
The album was released by 4AD on September 12 , 2011 and peaked at # 19 on the Billboard 200 , making it her first Top 20 LP .
Strange Mercy features very little of the ornately structured arrangements that marked Clark 's previous release , Actor , and is a much more guitar-oriented album than her previous LPs .
`` I wanted to make things direct and immediate , '' said Clark .
`` I did n't tinker .
I tried to keep the arrangements pretty simple and use just enough instrumentation to get the point across .
I did n't want anything to get in the way . ''
The publicity notes for Strange Mercy describe many of the tracks being `` about wanting relief from pain , and searching high and low for release . ''
Clark elaborated to Spinner on the kind of pain that she is singing about : `` There 's so many kinds of pain , '' she said .
`` There 's existential crisis pain , the physicality of grief , there 's losing people and reeling from that .
There 's self-induced , there 's externally induced .
It 's a smorgasbord of pain . ''
