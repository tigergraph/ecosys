Regions Of Light And Sound Of God was inspired by Lynd Ward 's 1929 graphic novel God 's Man , which tells of a struggling artist who sells his soul to the devil in order to get a magic paintbrush that allows him to instantly become famous .
James explained to Spin magazine that he wrote this song `` for when the guy is progressing in the city . ''
Speaking with Billboard magazine , James said the song `` started as just a sound collage . ''
He explained : `` I 've been into getting into trances in general and meditating .
I 'm really into Fela Kuti and James Brown and music that 's super repetitive , like the same -LSB- riff -RSB- for fu -- ing 10 minutes while all this other s -- t 's changing on top of it .
That one started with this loop that went on for much longer than is on the record .
That 's often how things like that 'll start ; I 'll just play that thing for 10 minutes and then solo all over it and then pick out the parts I like and condense it to the best parts .
I tried to make the beginning and end of the body of ` Know Till Now ' a sound collage of different parts floating through space and I just felt like that ending thing came out of nowhere like a big ship or something . ''
