Alesha Dixon told the Observer Music Magazine October 2008 that this song is about , `` when you 're heart-wrenchingly in love and it consumes you .
That feeling when you 're in love where you ca n't think beyond being in love with that person .
It can burn you .
A lot of people have experienced that .
And even though I do n't have that feeling now , I once did . ''
The Grammy-winning songwriter Diane Warren wrote this dramatic ballad .
