New York singer and guitarist St. Vincent -LRB- real name Annie Clark -RRB- recorded this song for the 2012 Record Store Day , unaware it shares a name with a synthetic heroin style drug .
`` I Googled ` krokodil ' after I 'd written the song and was horrified , '' Clark told NME .
`` I did n't write it in reference to the synthetic narco-terrorist heroin ravaging Russia . ''
The song 's name is Russian for crocodile , and Clark told NME that she gave the song its title , because `` I knew my Lithuanian bandmate would appreciate it . ''
She added : `` One look at me and people could see I have no firsthand knowledge of the drug .
Nor am I interested in glamorizing something so destructive .
Weak-stomached fans be warned !
Googling ` krokodil ' is not for the faint of heart ! ''
