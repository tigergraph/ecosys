This two-part 10-minute R&B odyssey finds Ocean singing of both ancient Egypt and the present day .
The song begins with a dream of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Cleopatra and her ultimate betrayal .
It switches to another doomed romance between the unemployed protagonist and his lonely strip club worker girlfriend , whom he calls Cleopatra .
She lives in a sleazy room and works at club called The Pyramid .
By the end of the song , the protagonist comes to a stark realization that her `` love ai n't free no more . ''
Large parts of Channel Orange were laid down at Eastwest Studio in Hollywood , in rooms where the Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra recorded many years previously , and some of the equipment remains unchanged .
Ocean produced the album primarily by himself with help from his close friend , writer/producer Malay .
In what is surely a first for the canine world , Everest , Ocean 's Bernese Mountain Dog , is credited as the executive producer .
The jazzy guitar solo is performed by John Mayer .
The singer-songwriter also appears in the song 's music video as Ocean 's companion during his vision quest .
This was released as the second single from Ocean 's debut album , Channel Orange .
The tracks are a collection of fictitious tales , some inspired by two relationships Ocean has had .
`` The work is the work , '' he told The New York Times .
`` The work is not me .
I like the anonymity that directors can have about their films .
Even though it 's my voice , I 'm a storyteller . ''
Accordingly , his name is not on the album cover .
The character of the pimp being provided for by his stripper girlfriend is rooted in real life .
`` I have actual pimps in my family in LA , '' Ocean revealed to UK newspaper The Guardian .
`` It was fantasy built off that dynamic ... but you can only write what you know to a point . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Nabil Elderkin , who has worked with Ocean on his `` Novacane '' and `` Swim Good '' clips .
`` Basically we wanted something enjoyable to watch that compliments the song , '' Elderkin told MTV News of the visual .
`` We just tried to come at it in that way that felt like he was on a trip , however you interpret it ; an absinthe-induced journey . ''
`` I just wanted to create something visually entertaining , '' he continued .
`` He told me two things : ' I want to have a desert scene driving a car and I want John Mayer performing somewhere with florescent lights behind him . '
So I just interpreted it in my own way .
`` Ocean eventually opted for a motorcycle rather than a car .
