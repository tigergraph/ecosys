Nick Lowe told The A.V. Club that Oprah Winfrey , of all people , inspired this song : `` When I was over here once I was watching an edition of The Oprah Winfrey Show .
They had some poor sap sitting there who 'd run off with a maid or something like that , and the audience was extremely upset with this guy .
I remember this large black lady standing up and shouting at the top of her voice , ` All men are liars !
All men are liars !
All men are liars ! '
She just was chanting it .
And I thought , ` Yeah , you know what ?
You 've got a point there , darling . '
And along came that song . ''
Party of One was Lowe 's eighth album .
It was produced by the Welsh musician , Dave Edmunds .
This song has a jab at the English Pop singer Rick Astley , whose surname Lowe rhymes with `` ghastly . ''
Lowe commented to Mojo April 2009 : `` They love that song in America .
Whenever I start doing it in my solo shows , you can feel the anticipation - they roll in the aisles like the Smash potato robots !
-LRB- Characters in Smash Instant Mash adverts -RRB- .
You think , ` Blimey , it 's not actually that funny , ' but it absolutely kills them .
I 'm sure he 's ever such a nice bloke and bear him no ill-will .
I really do feel bad whenever I sing the line ! ''
Robert Ellis recorded this for the 2012 tribute album , Lowe Country : The Songs of Nick Lowe .
