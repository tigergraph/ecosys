Lead singer Fish was born in Dalkeith , a town in the county of Midlothian , Scotland just outside Edinburgh .
Lothian is a district in Scotland and Midlothian is the middle part of it .
The Royal Mile , which is also referred to in the song , is the main High Street in Edinburgh .
There is a heart-shaped mosaic embedded into the pavement halfway up the Royal Mile in Edinburgh .
The heart is traditionally a symbol of local pride .
One of the Edinburgh football teams is known as Heart of Midlothian , or `` Hearts '' for short .
The song is split into 2 parts , firstly `` Wideboys , '' where Fish recalls fondly of when he was one of the wide boys , a term for teenagers spending all their cash in watering halls -LRB- pubs -RRB- as if they will never run out of money .
In the second part , known as `` Curtain Call , '' he is back in reality , wondering how he ended up in his current lifestyle , wanting to return to his old adolescent life , back to the waterhole .
Fish , like most Scots , is very proud of his county and saying that he was born with a Heart of Lothian is an echo of this local pride and nationalism .
Sir Walter Scott also wrote a book called The Heart of Lothian in 1818 and in this case the title of the book refers to the Old Tolbooth Prison in Edinburgh .
