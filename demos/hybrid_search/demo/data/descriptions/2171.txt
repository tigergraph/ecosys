Cook co-wrote this song with Goo Goo dolls frontman Johnny Rzeznik along with Gregg Wattenberg , who also co-penned Daughtry 's `` It 's Not Over , '' and singer-songwriter Ryan Star .
Cook explained to Billboard magazine how the song evolved over a long period of time : `` The bones of that song I got from Ryan Star and Gregg and Johnny Rzeznik , and we really toyed with that song over the course of a year .
The verses changed both in melody and in structure , the choruses changed a little bit - we wrote multiple versions of that song along the way . ''
