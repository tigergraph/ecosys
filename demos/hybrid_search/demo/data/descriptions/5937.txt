This is the second single from British girl group Girls Ca n't Catch .
The female trio explained to Music Promotions why they chose this for their sophomore release : `` We always said we was a darker pop band , we did n't have ` Echo ' at first , we just know what to release , When we heard ` Echo ' we went crazy for it we knew we wanted it for our second single .
Like when we heard ` Keep Your Head Up ' we liked it straight away , it 's a really good pop song . ''
The girls told Music Promotions about the song 's lyrical content : `` The story behind ` Echo ' is a relationship that is dead but wo n't die .
A girl wanting to communicate with her boyfriend , she is unhappy that he wont communicate with her .
It 's like she can only hear her own ` Echo . ' ''
