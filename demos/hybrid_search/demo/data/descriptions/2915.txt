Browne explained to American Songwriter magazine why this song of seeking and revelation was ambiguous : `` I think ambiguity is one of the great treasures I 've come upon late in life .
-LSB- With ` The Arms of Night ' -RSB- we wrote it in a key too high , and it took forever to figure out how to play it .
It 's magic .
It 's mysterious how a particular change will bring stuff out of you , and you 'll begin saying stuff ... and you wo n't know where it 's going or what you 're trying to say .
It 'd be so much easier if you knew what you wanted to write about and where you wanted to arrive , but it just does n't happen to work that way for me .
It 's more like an oracle .
The things that come out of your subconscious are much more capable of conveying the truth of the situation than what you 're consciously able to summon .
It was a challenge to try to figure out who I was talking to , because it 's one of those cases where I do a lot of talking to you , but I 'm really talking to myself about myself .
I like the ambiguity of the song ... I 'm either talking to someone who has betrayed me , or I 'm talking to myself about having betrayed myself .
It 's sort of left open , and I meant to leave it ambiguous . ''
