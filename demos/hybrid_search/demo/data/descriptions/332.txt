This song was written about the drummer from Bayside , John `` Beatz '' Hollohan , who died when Bayside , Aiden , Silverstein , and Hawthorne Heights were on the `` Never Sleep Again '' tour .
Bayside 's van hit an ice patch and flipped over , killing Hollohan .
The entire song is saying that they wo n't forget how great of a person he was .
