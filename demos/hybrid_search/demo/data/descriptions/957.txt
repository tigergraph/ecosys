Young wrote this song about his father , who had recently died .
In his last months of life , Young 's dad suffered from Dementia , which Neil said was very hard to deal with .
His little cousin told Neil at the funeral that his daddy was fine and knew what was going on because when they were in the car and a police car pulled up behind , he yelled `` Cop . ''
Neil found a lot of comfort and humor in the story.Neil speaks a bit more on his dad 's dementia in his 2005 documentary Neil Young : Heart of Gold .
He describes it , bittersweetly , as `` seeing your loved ones living in the moment . ''
