Darwin Deez leader Darwin Smith wrote this lament for the power of love , `` about the desperation I went through at the end of a dying romance . ''
He explained to NME that the title `` refers to the doppler effect as experienced in light waves , specifically light from distant stars .
As a light source moves away from you , the frequency of the light is decreased .
Just like the pitch of a siren or car horn as it passed you .
This observable astronomical phenomenon is the basis of the big bang theory . ''
