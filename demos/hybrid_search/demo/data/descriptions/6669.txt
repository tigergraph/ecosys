The lyrics for this sad , yearning lament that 's full of desire were taken from John Cooper Clarke 's poem of the same name .
The rhyme has been a staple setwork for British schoolboys for years , and vocalist Alex Turner explained to NME that it has been a huge inspiration for him as a lyricist : `` I was your typical teenager , trying to be cool and not interested and the teacher proceeded to read ' I Wan na Be Yours , ' doing an impression of Johnny , '' he recalled .
`` It made my ears prick up in the classroom because it was nothing like anything I 'd heard , especially on this syllabus .
Had I not seen him do his thing , I would n't have started writing like that . ''
John Cooper Clarke recalled to NME penning his ' I Wan na Be Yours ' poem : `` I wrote it along with a load of others at the time , I tend to write like that , '' he said .
`` I remember when it was - about '83 or '84 or something like that .
It 's come to my attention that it 's the wedding favourite .
The number of people that have said , ' I had that read at my wedding ' , or ` My husband proposed to me using that number ' ... It 's been very useful in the world of modern romance !
It is to modern wedding ceremonies what ` Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life ' by Eric Idle is to humanist funerals .
I probably go to a great many more funerals than you do , so take it from me . ''
Alex Turner recalled to Spin magazine meeting John Cooper Clarke at one of the poet 's gigs in the very early days of the Arctic Monkeys .
`` I had n't started writing our first tunes yet , '' he said .
`` We had just put this band together and I did n't know anything .
I met him later that night , and we were like , ` We work on the bar and we actually have this band , and they 're called the Arctic Monkeys . '
And he 's like , ` Ah , that 's such a great name . '
He 's the first person and only person that 's ever liked the name .
He said , ' I love it .
It 's like a picture , a drama , this monkey in the snow ! ' ''
This was the first song that the Monkeys have ever recorded with a drum machine .
Producer James Ford told NME : `` That 's the thing , on the last record we tried to do a ` band in a room ' type thing , with barely any computers used .
It was very much to tape .
But this one was a case of ` all bets are off ' .
The band wanted to push things on and do something different .
So to move it on and make it sound different we were very open to using bits of keyboards or drum machines , or whatever worked for the song really .
Obviously it still has to link into them and feel like them , but ... `` Alex Turner said of the drum machine to NME : `` It 's the first time we 've done that .
An old Selmer drum machine , and the setting on it was ` Liverpool . ' ''
Alex Turner changed the odd bit for the Monkey 's version , adding one of his own lines : `` Secrets I have held in my heart .
Are harder to hide than I thought . ''
Clarke told NME that he expected some modifications .
`` I think that 's great , that 's what people do with songs , '' he said .
`` There 's a tradition with this .
Especially a number like that , because it cries out for updating because it uses brand names .
One would expect it to be kind of updated , in much the same way that Sinatra might use different comparisons for a song like ` You 're The Top ' by Cole Porter . ''
