This acoustic boogie tune is a cover of a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Fred Eaglesmith .
`` I heard it on satellite radio one day in the car , '' Jackson told Billboard magazine : `` I listen to bluegrass on there a lot .
I was n't familiar with it , and I thought it would be a good remake . ''
Jackson explained in press materials why he chose to make this song the title track of his sixteenth album : `` I 'd been kicking around several songs to title the album after , like ` It 's Just That Way ' and ` Every Now and Then . '
But they sounded too much like album titles I 'd already had , like Who I Am , and What I Do ... I 've had about every other vehicle -- boats , cars , motorcycles -- but I 'd never had a train on the album cover . ''
