This song had it 's debut far ahead of it 's release on the album Insomniac .
At the height of the Dookie tour , the band was asked to perform at the MTV Music Awards .
MTV asked them to perform `` Basket Case '' since the video was up for awards that night .
When it came time to perform , the band played this without telling anyone beforehand .
For many months the song 's title was not even known .
That live version even got tagged onto many international live bootleg CD 's under the title `` Lost Inside Myself . ''
