This track closes Soundgarden 's sixth album , King Animal .
It originated with some jamming by bassist Ben Shepherd , leading to an entirely new approach for the reformed grunge legends .
Frontman Chris Cornell explained to Artist Direct : `` On this album , we recorded the rehearsals , which we 've never done before .
By rehearsals , I mean songwriting sessions where we were messing around .
The song is based on this litter interlude on the bass Ben played when the rest of us were talking .
We were n't even paying attention , and he was just messing around .
I heard it .
I thought it was one of those things I 'd try to tune into since the beginning of Soundgarden .
Everybody in the band is capable of throwing out something brilliant without necessarily knowing it or paying attention to it .
Sometimes , I chase that down .
Having the ability to check the recording and seek it down , I found the spot that I liked and looped the part of it I thought worked in the context of a loop .
Then , we created the song around it .
We 'd never really done anything like that before . ''
