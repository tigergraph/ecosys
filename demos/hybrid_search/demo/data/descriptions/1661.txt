In this song Groves sings about her battles with onstage anxiety attacks .
She told Christianity Today magazine : `` I was not a member of the club until a year and a half ago , and I do n't say that lightly .
My mom has talked to me about her experiences with anxiety , and honestly , my thoughts back to her would be , ` Well , get over it .
It 's not true .
When your thoughts go haywire and your body is having this fear response , just tell yourself it 's not true . '
Until one day I was playing at a prayer breakfast -- something very benign , not a big deal .
My body had a full fear response to something that was n't there .
I was in the middle of a song , and it was as if a bear had walked in the room in the middle of my song .
I called my best friend who is a counselor , and I said , ` What just happened to me ? '
and she was like , ` You just read the textbook for an anxiety attack . '
It does n't happen every time I get on stage , but it is limited to the stage .
I feel like there 's a spiritual , emotional , physical element to it , but it 's definitely changed my emotional landscape the last year and a half .
I 'm still in it , but I 'm making progress .
I really , really believe that God wants me to be weak .
He wants to be strong in my weakness .
And he 's teaching me that when I get on the other side of this , I 'm going to be a stronger person .
But it is not fun .
It 's not pleasant .
It feels absolutely terrible . ''
