Blige penned this song for the movie Precious , which is an adaptation of the book Push by African-American author Sapphire .
The harrowing film tells the story of a young woman growing up in a cycle of incest , rape and domestic abuse .
Blige told Billboard magazine why she decided to contribute to the movie : '' -LSB- Director -RSB- Lee Daniels wanted me to get involved with this film .
I saw the movie and I was like , ` why would n't I want to be involved ?
Why would n't I want to do a song for this film ? ' ''
She added : `` I did n't have lyrics as far as writing , but I saw the film and I was able to relate automatically because I 've lived some of that girl 's life and I know people who have lived most of her life . ''
Blige continued : `` My first impression of the film was that it was going to shock a lot of people .
It 's a very powerful film .
I 've been coming from a personal place ever since I spoke on the My Life album .
But we never look back into the why - why is all this happening to us ?
And that is what Precious is about .
Getting that song out , I had to dig back into the ` why , ' and digging back into the why is what hurts the most . ''
