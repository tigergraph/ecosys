This dynamic track might sound upbeat , but lyrically it is a rather vicious song about someone who upset the singer .
The tune was written by Dido and produced by Greg Kurstin , whose previous credits include collaborations with Ke $ ha , Kylie Minogue , Lily Allen and Marina and the Diamonds .
She told Canada.com : `` It takes so much to actually annoy me -- someone could keep jabbing at me and I wo n't get annoyed -- but once someone has crossed me one too many times it 's not great .
So this is a song where I came into the studio and this one person had just betrayed me really badly and I felt I just had to just say how I feel about it .
I do n't usually do that in such a direct way , but this is a real direct attack on somebody . ''
`` The amazing thing is they then heard the song , loved it and had no clue it was about them , '' continued Dido .
`` They still have no clue !
One day I 'll probably get drunk and tell everyone who it 's about , but not today . ''
The song was released as the second single from Girl Who Got Away .
`` The first day the album was out there fans said this should be the next single , so that was that , '' Dido told Digital Spy .
`` It 's great having that instant reaction - I 've never had that on my previous albums as Twitter had n't really got going during my last record . ''
