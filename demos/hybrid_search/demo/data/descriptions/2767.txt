This Boi-1da-produced track was the first song to be released off Schoolboy Q 's major-label debut Oxymoron .
He explained on MTV 's RapFix Live that the song is a coming-of-age drug tale .
`` It 's basically the story of me as a kid , '' said Q , `` dealing with my mom and sneaking behind mom 's and grandmom 's back . ''
Concerned about the song title which is slang for cocaine , Q and his Top Dawg Entertainment team decided to release it for the fans rather than making it Oxymoron 's official lead single .
`` I was scared to put the record out , a record called ` Yay Yay ' as the single , '' he told RapFix Live , laughing .
`` I do n't think that 's really good . ''
