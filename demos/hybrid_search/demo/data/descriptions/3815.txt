Jessie Ware told the story of the song to The Sun : '' ` Taking In Water ' is a song about my little brother .
We were not getting on that well at the time and this song was a way of having a conversation with him .
I am quite hard on him a lot of the time and I wanted to write a really heartfelt song to him .
I was influenced by Alicia Keys and The Weekend for this song . ''
