Frontman Ben Burnley told Artist Direct the story behind the song : `` It 's a little reflective of what 's going on in the country right now , and it 's a little reflective of the camaraderie of our armed forces .
You could apply it to that , or you could apply it to a relationship .
Leaving things vague is actually harder than people think , and that 's something that sobriety has helped with too .
It 's really easy to write about a subject because you have that subject to go off of .
I really take great efforts so that it 's vague enough to mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people .
I 'm the sole lyric writer in the band so every album is a reflection of what I 'm going through at the time or what I was thinking . ''
