This honky-tonk waltz is one of three songs on Twang written by the father and son team of George and Bubba Strait .
George had n't appeared in the writer 's credits of an album since early in his career .
He told Sirius XM about his return to songwriting .
`` I 've toyed with the idea through the years , but I just got lazy about it , actually , '' George confessed .
`` My wife had thrown out the idea of ` Out of Sight , Out of Mind , ' and -LSB- Bubba -RSB- kind of took that and started writing it .
I ended up helping him finish it . ''
