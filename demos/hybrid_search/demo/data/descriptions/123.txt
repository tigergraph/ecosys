Nick Jonas told MTV News that while he likes all the songs on the album , this one might be a little more emotional than the rest .
`` There is a song called ` In the End ' which is the most Bill Withers-inspired song on the record , '' he said .
`` It 's actually about someone taking things that do n't belong to them and how it will come back to haunt them . ''
Nick told Shine On Media : `` It 's about something I actually went through where someone took things that were n't theirs .
It 's a song about how it will come back to haunt you in the end . ''
