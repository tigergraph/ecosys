This sad song is about a little girl who is abused by her mother .
In the video , she goes to school with the same dress she wore the day before and tries to hide her bruises , but the teacher sees them anyway , but does n't ask .
The girl seems to befriend this little boy who lives next door and they become friends .
But one night , the little boy looks into the window of the little girl 's house and sees her mom beating on the girl .
Eventually , the girl dies and goes to `` A place where she 's loved . ''
