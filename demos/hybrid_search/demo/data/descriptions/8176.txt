Matt Davies-Kreye -LRB- vocals -RRB- explained the meaning of this track to Kerrang !
magazine September 13 , 2008 : `` I think you can interpret the words of this song in many ways .
On one hand , it is a song about creative independence , and on the other it 's a song about not being fed information that media hands to us to devour every day .
It 's about making up your own mind and seeing the real truths , not the ones told to us via a corporate interference . ''
