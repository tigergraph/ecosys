Toby Keith explained this song on the press release for That Do n't Make Me a Bad Guy : `` It 's like the old George Jones song : Someday when things are good , I 'm gon na leave you .
It 's that idea of I ca n't ever seem to leave you , I always let you come back .
So why do n't you tell me you really love me this time , then when you do leave it 'll hurt a lot worse and I wo n't invite you back .
He 's trying to get himself in the right mentality to never let her back in again .
It 's a bad deal . ''
