This song about ignoring fear of the unknown and going on an adventure was the last track Tim Rice-Oxley wrote for Strangeland .
He commented : `` It started off feeling a bit more country , but gradually got more and more energetic .
It 's one of my favourites - I love the optimism of it . ''
Rice-Oxley commented to NME that the Strangeland album title is akin to `` an adventure ... full of uncertainty , and the potential for mishap , as well as the possibility of amazing things and glorious discoveries .
`` He added : `` I love the idea of the journey through ` Strangeland ' being a journey of redemption . ''
Said Rice-Oxley regarding the song 's inspirations : `` The feeling of being on an adventure , sleeping under the stars and so on is all stuff that I love - I had just been reading Woody Guthrie 's Bound For Glory .
And I think it has some of the grace and acceptance that recur in ` Watch How You Go ' and ` In Your Own Time . ' ''
