Craig David told ilikemusic.com : `` Lyrically it was trying to say a guy never truly understands how a girl 's mind really works .
As a guy tries to and thinks he knows , it 's six of one thing and half a dozen of another .
And I just wanted to try and put it in a way that does n't have to be about a break up or a relationship starting , but having an up tempo base record allowed it to feel , rather than taking it in the negative way , of not being able to understand what a girl is talking about , I was able to make it based around a dance track that you could play in a club so it would get some spins and then also going out to Cuba , to Havana to record the record , because the musicians out there were able to give the song enough of the live feel , especially with the horn section and the percussion to make it feel like a feel good song , not necessarily a depressing one . ''
In the same interview David described his music making process : `` I do like something to set me off , be it as simple as an acoustic guitar and you start to play some chords or around the piano or , if it 's beat driven that then usually drives me into making it more for the club .
Because at a certain tempo , half the time people are n't listening to what the lyrics are anyway at this tempo , they just want to dance .
So there are lots of things that inspire me .
But I do like it usually when it 's based around a beat , because then you think , ` yeah I 'm in this , ' and it 's quite hypnotic and then you lay some melodies and hopefully you 've written a song . ''
