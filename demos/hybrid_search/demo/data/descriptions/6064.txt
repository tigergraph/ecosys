This dark , sensual electronic ballad finds Shirley Manson singing about what appears to be a sex worker .
`` Look but do n't touch till the light goes on , '' she whispers .
Guitarist told Duke Erikson told MusicRadar.com how the song came together : `` I had come up with an idea on acoustic guitar , very simple , '' he said , `` so I recorded it with a little rhythm track , did the first verse and basically the arrangement for the song .
Shirley loved it and immediately started singing -- I think she must had had some words already written . ''
`` Originally , I had a straighter rhythm , but we started messing around with a dubby kind of irregular pattern , '' he continued .
`` I played drums on the song - I cut them at Smart Studios in Madison .
Mike Zirkel , the engineer there , got me set up , I played some stuff , and we picked what worked .
The drums are n't very prominent , but they serve their purpose .
`` Erikson concluded : `` The song could still work as a straight-ahead acoustic samba .
But as it happens with all our tunes , we stretched it out and looked for as many sounds as we could , without harming the song .
It 's easy with experimentation to lose the song , so we try to be aware of that . ''
Speaking to Idolator.com , Erikson described Manson 's vocal as `` quite amazing . ''
