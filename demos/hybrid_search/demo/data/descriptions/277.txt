Emerging from the Yorkshire town where much of the British soap Emmerdale is filmed , post-punk revival quartet The Chevin started making waves in Europe when this song was included on the soundtrack for the video game , FIFA 13 .
Frontman Coyle Girelli told The Sun about penning this song : `` It came out of rehearsal .
We wrote the end section and then I went away and wrote the rest of the song on my own .
It took a good two weeks to finish .
It was n't purposely meant to be sporty , but it certainly does have that football montage vibe about it when you hear it . ''
