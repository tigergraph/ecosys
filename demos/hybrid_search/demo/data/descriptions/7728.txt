This is a track from the self-titled debut solo album by producer and TV on the Radio guitarist Dave Sitek , which he recorded under the name of Maximum Balloon .
The song features TV on the Radio lead singer Tunde Adebimpe .
Sitek told The Guardian : `` The first TV On the Radio album was basically just Tunde and I in our New York apartment , so it was fun to revisit those days .
When the two of us are on the same frequency it works really easily .
Our chemistry is reflected in this song , although with every year that goes by I get more and more pissed that I 'm not him .
For someone who never intended to be a singer , that guy kills it , man .
He 's an instant classic-maker .
You hear one of his songs and it feels like you 've heard it your whole life .
He 's got a superpower . ''
