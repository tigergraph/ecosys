Mike Skinner of The Streets told the Observer Music Monthly about this song : `` It 's got a natural sound because it was made with live instruments .
I guess it 's spiritual in a pragmatic way .
I 'm trying not to mention modern life .
I do n't want to start sounding like some guru but it definitely reflects a change in my mental state . ''
The music video features footage of a 770-mile walk that Skinner made from Dover in the south east of England to Cannes in the south of France .
This was offered online as a free download in the months preceding the album 's release .
