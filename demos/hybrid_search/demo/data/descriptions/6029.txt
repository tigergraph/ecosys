This epic song debuted at # 1 on the R&R Christian Rock chart .
It was the first single to ever debut at # 1 on any Christian radio chart .
Barnes explained the album title to NewReleaseTuesday : `` You know , when we 're first born we have an innocence about us , but as we grow into maturity we develop an instinctual nature .
Innocence and Instinct represents that duality ; the two are polar opposites of each other . ''
Vocalist Michael Barnes told NewReleaseTuesday , that this song concerns the spiritual battle that we all go through .
He explained that it , `` portrays what the whole album is about : it 's that constant fight -- that battle within us .
In Romans 7:19 , Paul talks about the struggle he 's facing between good and evil .
He writes : ' I do n't do the good thing I want to do , but I do the wrong thing that I do n't want to do . ' ''
Barnes added that Dante 's medieval poem , The Divine Comedy , in particular its first movement Inferno , contributed to the concept of Innocence and Instinct .
He explained : `` As we were writing this record , Dante 's Inferno was one of the books we were reading .
What really inspired the idea behind the constant fight we 're talking about was some of the illustrations by Gustave Dor√© , which are found in Dante 's Inferno - especially the scenes where the angels are battling each other .
With our first record End of Silence , we focused on redemption and restoration in the midst of a broken situation .
On our latest project , Innocence and Instinct , we talk about the struggle itself and the battle that all of us face . ''
