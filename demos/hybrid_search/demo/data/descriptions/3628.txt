She wrote the song with John Beck and Steven Chrisanthou and it was released on March 7 , 2011 .
The singer has n't been any more forthcoming about the song in other interviews .
Beatweek magazine asked Doolittle if it 's a `` sarcastic take on the whole medicine thing . ''
She replied : `` Everyone thinks it 's about drugs but it 's not .
It 's actually the only song that I have n't told anyone what it 's about yet , because no one seems to have guessed and I just ca n't believe it because it 's so obvious .
`` Guess its time to get our rhyming dictionary out and look up `` Mr. Medicine ! ''
The song includes the lyrics , `` Oh , Mr. Medicine/I will take anything/what do you recommend ? ''
Viva magazine asked the singer if this Medicine is a metaphoric Mr. , or represents an actual person in her life ?
Doolittle replied : `` It 's a secret !
Everyone has tried to work out who or what Mr. Medicine is , but I 'll give you a clue : it rhymes with Mr. Medicine ! ''
