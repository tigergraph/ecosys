In this song , lead singer John McClure rails against 9-to-5 conformity .
`` Heavyweight Champion Of The World '' tells a story of under-achievers , with the use of the ironic hook `` Just be like everybody else . ''
The song title is taken from a line of Barry Hines book A Kestrel For A Knave .
Like the song , the book 's main character is an under-achieving young boy growing up in Yorkshire .
The Reverend is in fact John McClure , who in 2001 formed the band Judan Suki , which included Alex Turner , whom he met on a bus .
Not long after , Turner formed The Arctic Monkeys .
The two later became roommates .
