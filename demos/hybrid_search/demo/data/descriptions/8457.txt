Lesley Roy told MTV News why she titled the album after this song .
Explained Roy : `` I called the album that because it 's when I hit rock bottom .
It 's the question a lot of people ask when they 're in a relationship , and it 's like ` where was the point where you did n't find me attractive anymore ? '
It 's a universal feeling and an unusual word .
A lot of people ask me about it and relate to it .
And the world is not perfect right now .
Unbeautiful seems like a realistic title for a lot of things that are happening . ''
