This is a track from Adrenaline Mob 's self-titled and self-produced debut EP , which was released on August 9 , 2011 .
The band comprises drummer Mike Portnoy , frontman Russell Allen , guitarists Mike Orlando and Rich Ward and bassist Paul DiLeo .
Orlando explained the song 's meaning to AntiMusic : `` Lyrically Russ and I took the idea of basically telling someone your close to , yes you may have f -- ked up in life or on the path you choose ... but take my advice and turn it around .
You have one more chance , do n't let it pass you by this time . ''
Orlando told the story of the song in an interview with AntiMusic : `` On ` Believe Me , ' I was inspired by the likes of Sevendust and Korn and that big drop tuned heavy thunder .
So I grabbed the Les Paul , tuned it to drop B and went to town .
Not soon after in my daily trip to the Chanty Shack , we popped in the track and right off the bat Russ knocked me out with the verses .
He knew exactly where I was at with this track from the moment we started .
Real heavy verse that goes into this great big open wide chorus where Russ just soars vocally and melodically .
After tweaking and tweaking the arrangement we injected the mid and outro solos which have all the melodic content this track called for , met with some ferocious shredding where Portnoy and myself lock so tightly on songs end .
It 's a perfect climactic ending ! ''
