This song finds Womack singing about self-serving preachers .
He told Mojo magazine : `` From where I came up in gospel and where it is today , it 's about making money .
When I looked on TV I saw a pastor , he had this advertisement and he had all these people he called his disciples walking along behind him .
I said , ` Man , That ai n't Jesus , that 's a pimp . ' ''
