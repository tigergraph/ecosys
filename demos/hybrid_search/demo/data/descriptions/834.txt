For vocalist Ivan Moody , the most difficult part of being in a band is the amount of time they spend on the road away from their families .
This ballad reflects how heart-rending it is to miss out on spending time with his children .
`` With that said , I still love what I do and I would never change it for anything , '' said Moody in a video interview , `` so this was my apology to the ones we leave behind every time we go on the road . ''
