This song was co-written by John Legend , who also features on piano .
Pixie told the Mail On Sunday 's You Magazine that she and the American multiple-Grammy winning musician had difficulty arranging a convenient time to meet up for their collaboration .
She recalled : `` I met John Legend through a songwriter friend who thought we should work together and sent him one of my ballads .
I went to meet him at his house in LA and we got on really well .
Our schedules were crazy , but we found this one day when we were both in New York at the same time , so I got straight off a plane and went to a studio and we got the song done there and then . ''
