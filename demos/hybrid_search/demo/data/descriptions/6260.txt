This high octane Europop track was co-written and produced by Swedish hit-makers Max Martin and Johan Shellback .
Texan songwriter Savan Kotecha , whose credits include the 2007 X-Factor winner Shayne Ward 's hit single , `` Breathless , '' and `` Brave '' from Leona Lewis ' 2009 album , Echo , also co-penned the song .
Lambert told MTV News : `` The message in the song is really exciting , because basically what it 's saying is no matter what color your skin is , no matter what religion you are , no matter what your sexuality is , no matter what your age is , we can all party together .
We can all find common love .
And all this other stuff - money , success , fortune , fashion , glam - it 's all great , but it does n't mean anything if you 're not connecting .
I love it . ''
Lambert discussed this song with Digital Spy : `` I think it 's got a great message .
It does sound a bit cliché but I love promoting love and acceptance and I think the song definitely gets that across .
In the pop market we 're so sex-saturated and a lot of the big artists are popular because they 're `` so fierce ! ''
and badass .
I love that and get a kick out of that - people like GaGa and Beyoncé especially - but that 's the ground I was trying to cover with ` For Your Entertainment ' .
The thing about ` If I Had You ' is that it reflects what I 'm really about , which is joy . ''
Lambert told MTV News about the song 's music video : `` The thing about the video -LSB- is -RSB- there is a love interest : It 's all my friends , '' he explained .
`` It 's about the love that you have with your circle of people that you surround yourself with .
`` The ` If I Had You ' video we shot in the woods at night , '' he continued .
`` I was inspired by the parties that I 've gone to in the past , like Burning Man and this other party called Lightning in a Bottle .
There 's a big kind of subculture in California and around the country of people who are designers and performance artists , just free spirits that like to come together and play dress-up and have a good time .
And it 's a very specific community , one that 's inspired me a lot .
`` Lambert added that rather than casting actors to look like they could be part of this subculture , he got his pals onboard .
`` I invited my friends to come party in my video , so there 's a real authentic joy , '' he explained .
`` And it gets kind of psychedelic .
There 's just gon na be a lot of special effects - Some are from -LSB- Los Angeles variety extravaganza -RSB- The Zodiac Show some are from parties -LSB- and -RSB- clubs .
Some of them I 've done theater with .
It 's a big variety of people .
`` Amongst Lambert 's friends that make cameo appearances in the clip are Allison Iraheta and Ke $ ha .
