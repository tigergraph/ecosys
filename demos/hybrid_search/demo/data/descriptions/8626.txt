Life happens .
And during the course of it , sometimes people allow the little things to alter their perception of what is important .
`` I had been talking to somebody , '' says singer/songwriter Ken Block , `` and just in conversation we were talking about how as things unfold in your life , things come sort of stacking in different piles around you .
And in that conversation , I said , ` Man , life gets in the way . '
And I stopped , and that line just hung with me . ''
So he approached Richard Marx , with whom he was co-writing , and told him about the song idea.Their co-writing effort on this song took form as a `` kind of relationship song , '' says Block , `` where it 's easy when things are simple , but as things build and life gets in the way , whether it 's finances or work or kids or all those different things , the deepest love can be tripped up by things that start to stack up against us .
And so it 's about remembering ; going back and daring somebody to forget .
I mean , ` How dare you not remember where the foundation of this was ? '
This is just life that 's getting in the way .
This should n't be enough to rock things . ''
`` There 's a line in there , ' I wanted us to be the ones the poets write the books about , ' and it gets to that point where I see so many people around me who go through the same pattern : they fall in love , and things go great for a long time , and then when things get hard , they bail , instead of working through that and realizing that that 's what life is .
That 's how you get to the next level is working through that stuff .
Because if you do n't , you start it over again and then it 's just like ` lather , rinse , repeat . '
Until you get through there , you just keep repeating that cycle . ''
`` Sometimes , '' advises Block , `` you have to be reminded of what 's really real , what 's important . ''
