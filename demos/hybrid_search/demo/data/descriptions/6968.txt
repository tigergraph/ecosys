The first song penned by Nash for her Girl Talk album finds her ruminating on the pitfalls of friendships that are ridden with jealousies and desires .
`` It 's about rubbish friends , '' she said , `` when someone cares more about material things than they do about you . ''
The sixties-inspired video finds Kate Nash donning numerous wardrobe , hair and makeup changes .
The assortment of different looks Kate sports symbolizes how she could n't be herself , when the friend targeted in the song was unkind to her .
