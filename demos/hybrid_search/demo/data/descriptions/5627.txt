Most of the album was recorded before the event , but Neil Young wrote this song after Kurt Cobain 's death .
Cobain quoted Young 's lyric , `` It 's better to burn out than fade away '' -LRB- from `` My My , Hey Hey -LRB- Out Of The Blue -RRB- '' -RRB- in his suicide note .
This affected Neil , who was inspired musically by Kurt Cobain and Nirvana on Sleeps With Angels .
Young , in turn , was an influence on Nirvana and the whole Grunge scene , as loud , distorted guitars were his thing in the late '70s .
Neil had been trying to reach Cobain by phone in the weeks leading up to his suicide .
Although he refused to talk about Cobain 's death for years , Neil opened up a bit in a 2002 interview with The Guardian : `` I like to think that I possibly could have done something .
I was just trying to reach him .
Trying to connect up with him .
It 's just too bad I did n't get a shot .
I had an impulse to connect .
Only when he used my song in that suicide note was the connection made .
Then , I felt it was really unfortunate that I did n't get through to him .
I might 've been able to make things a little lighter for him , that 's all .
Just lighten it up a little bit . ''
