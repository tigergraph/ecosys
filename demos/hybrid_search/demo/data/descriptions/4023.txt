This song is about cocaine and China White heroin , 2 of lead singer Anthony Kiedis ' drugs of choice .
Both are a white powdery substance , which looks like snow .
The lyrics , `` So white as snow ... Privately divided by a world so undecided '' refer to dividing the coke/heroin into lines , so as to deal them or snort them .
The line , `` The more I see , the less I know , the more I 'd like to let it go '' means the deeper Kiedis was immersed in these drugs , the less he knew what was going on , and the more he wanted to kick the habit .
-LRB- thanks , Ethan - Mt. Pleasent , SC -RRB- Anthony Kiedis : `` It 's about the repeated failure to start your life anew and how difficult it can be to get rid off old ways of thinking , and destructive ideas we become so attached to . ''
-LRB- thanks , Erik - Fairfield County , CT -RRB-
