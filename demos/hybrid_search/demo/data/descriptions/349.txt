This was written by System Of A Down guitarist Daron Malakian , who also sings lead on the track .
The song seems to be about a particularly difficult day in his life .
The line , `` It 's a day I 'm glad I survived '' indicates there is some event he is trying to forget .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - petersham , MA -RRB- The lyrics contain a double superlative that would make an English teacher shiver : `` The most loneliest '' is incorrect grammar - the correct form is simply `` The loneliest . ''
The song appeared in Disturbia , a 2006 movie starring Shia LeBeouf which was about a kid who stays on house arrest and watches his neighbors to pass the time .
The song appeared in a sequence in the movie where Shia 's character tries to find ways of keeping himself from dying of boredom .
-LRB- thanks , Logan - Troy , MT -RRB- This got a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance , but lost to Wolfmother 's `` Woman . ''
The opening guitar is based on the song `` The House Of The Rising Sun . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France , for above 3 -RRB-
