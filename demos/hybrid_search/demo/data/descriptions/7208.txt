This is about the drug crystal meth , which is referred to in the song as a `` palace of ice . ''
The song explains how the palace is a paradise which mirrors the temporary bliss associated with the consumption of meth .
However the next part of the lyrics say , `` We may never come back from the palace of ice because the rift is a door , '' which alludes to crystal meth 's highly addictive nature .
