After being told by his original managers that he needed to conform to succeed by dying his ginger hair and ditching his unique loop-pedal rapped delivery , Sheeran responded by penning this song .
A live version of the tune , which Sheeran filmed for leading youth broadcaster SB : TV in February 2010 , immediately racked up 100,000 hits in two days on YouTube .
The song is also known by its longer title , `` You Need Me , I Do n't Need You . ''
The song was chosen as the second single and follow up to his breakthrough hit `` The A Team . ''
It was released on August 28 , 2011 in the United Kingdom .
`` I was told by countless people that it would n't get anywhere and that I should stop playing it , so to actually have it as my second single is flippin ' wicked '' said Sheeran .
The music video was directed by Emil Nava -LRB- Jessie J , Devlin -RRB- and features 17-year-old actor Matthew Morgan signing the lyrics to the song .
