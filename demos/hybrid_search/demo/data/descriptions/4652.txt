Josh Kelley wrote this song with Thomas Miller and his producer Clint Lagerberg , and it appears on his debut Country album , Georgia Clay .
Kelley told us : `` I love that song .
The song is kind of about going to your high school reunion and meeting up with the same person maybe you used to date , and then going back through all those motions .
Like , ` Oh , my God , let 's go back to where we experienced this , and let 's do this . '
It 's kind of about that .
Is this a great idea , or a good memory ?
Should we do this or not ?
You know .
That song really goes over well live , too , man .
People love it right when we start kicking into that thing . ''
