Paul Heaton told the Daily Telegraph July 3 , 2008 about this seven-minute rant concerning Britain 's descent into low-brow mediocrity : `` I just started listing the things that annoyed me , and it would n't stop .
I think a lot of people feel guilt about how much weight as a country we have put on , we 've become flabby and greedy and a bit spoilt .
It feels as if we 've guzzled on a very fatty cultural diet . ''
Heaton told Mojo magazine August 2008 : `` It 's very me that song , even down to the fact it lasts that long .
I wo n't let it drop , I 'm not one for letting things lie . ''
This began life as a poem for legendary funk bassist Bootsy Collins .
