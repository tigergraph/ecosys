The Edge sang the lead vocal .
This is only the second time he did this , the first was on `` Seconds '' from their album War .
This started as an outtake from the Achtung Baby sessions called `` Down All The Days . ''
The video showed members of the band methodically tying ropes around The Edge .
The backing drumbeat was taken from the Nazi propaganda film Triumph Of The Will , which shows an 11 year-old boy playing drums at the 1936 Olympics .
The Edge wrote the entire song , even the lyrics .
He had recently gone through a divorce .
