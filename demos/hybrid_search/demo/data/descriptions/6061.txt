Hawk Nelson Wrote this song for the 2005 remake of the movie Yours , Mine , and Ours , starring Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo .
Unlike Hawk Nelson 's songs about faith , this was merely based on partying and having fun .
The video for this song is the scene in the movie when the children have a party .
Another Hawk Nelson song , `` Things we Go Through , '' also partially played in this scene .
