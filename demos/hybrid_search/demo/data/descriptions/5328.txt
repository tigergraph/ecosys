R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck contributes to three The King is Dead tracks and on this stripped-back rocker , frontman Colin Meloy tried to musically pay tribute to The Athens band 's early work , especially their second album , Reckoning .
`` I was listening so much to the reissue when it came out last year , '' he told Spin magazine .
`` And it opened up for me .
I was like ' I want to write a Reckoning song .
`` Meloy added : `` The words may not bear that much resemblance , but I think the melody is very Stipe-ish . ''
The song was previously known as `` Dirty Fingers . ''
Meloy told Billboard magazine why he asked Peter Buck to contribute to three tracks on The King is Dead : `` On a lot of songs I wrote for this record , I was trying to free my mind from more academic music interests I had over the last four or five years and trying to reconnect with some of the music that initially got me playing guitar and writing songs in the first place , '' he explained .
`` So I started writing these boldfaced R.E.M. songs , and I thought , ` If we 're going to go there , it would be fun to get Peter -LSB- Buck -RSB- to get onboard , ' and he was totally into it . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Michael Schur , who is known for co-creating NBC 's The Office .
The clip is a dark tribute to David Foster Wallace 1996 novel Infinite Jest , which is a dystopian vision of North America in the near future .
`` I had this funny idea that a good video for the song would be a re-creation of the Enfield Tennis Academy 's round of Eschaton - basically , a global thermonuclear crisis re-created on a tennis court - that 's played about a third of the way into the book , '' Meloy told NPR .
`` I found a kindred spirit in Michael Schur , a man with an even greater enthusiasm for Wallace 's work than my own .
With much adoration and respect to this seminal , genius book , this is what we 've come up with . ''
