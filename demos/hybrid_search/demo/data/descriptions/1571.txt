This is the opening track and lead single from American Country-Pop singer-songwriter Shelby Lynne 's eleventh studio album , Loser Dreamer .
The record was triggered by a telephone conversation with Brian `` Brain '' Harrison , who engineered the sessions and played bass , Moog and percussion .
Their discussion about musicians and relationships ended the dry spell Lynne had been experiencing as a songwriter .
This song was inspired by a rare storm in the Southern California desert where Lynne resides .
As the rain fell one Sunday morning , Lynne , who misses the Southern rainstorms of her Alabama childhood , resisted the impulse to go outside and stand in it , and grabbed a pen instead .
The resulting song is a sunny tune about having the blues .
`` The dark side of me seems to like how it feels when it 's pouring , '' she sings exuberantly .
