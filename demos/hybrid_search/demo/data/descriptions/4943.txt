Singer Rou Reynolds told Kerrang !
May 2 , 2009 that `` this song has my favourite line , ` Our gracious Queen should grasp her crown and take a good f -- king swing at Blair and Brown ! ' . ''
He added : `` Lyrically , it was our last chance to have a massive outpouring of frustration . ''
The song title is a play on words of American composer Aaron Copland 's 1942 classical piece `` Fanfare For The Common Man . ''
In 1977 a rocked-up version became a hit single for the British rock trio Emerson , Lake & Palmer .
Reynolds plays the trumpet on this track and his brother the trombone .
The vocalist explained to Kerrang !
: `` We wanted to have an outro with a massive brass section with gang vocals . ''
He added `` The trumpet was the first instrument I ever learned .
I started when I was eight years old .
I stopped because it was n't cool and I did n't want cheeks like Dizzy Gillespie .
I picked it up again last year . ''
