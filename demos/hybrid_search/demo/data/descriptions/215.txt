This song is a duet between Furtado and Timbaland , who produced the album .
The lyrics are a flirtation between the two , typical of a couple who meets at a dance club or other social gathering .
They are both sexually active , but the girl does n't want the guy to take advantage of her and think of her as a slut , so even though she is attracted to him , she will tease him and test him to make sure he has strong `` game , '' meaning he is a good talker and exudes confidence .
As the song progresses , he proves himself and she agrees that they both want the same thing .
At this point , there is no need to play games , as he has passed the test .
The verses are rapped , which was familiar territory for Timbaland , who often raps on his productions , but was a departure for Furtado , who was known for her singing on hits like `` I 'm Like A Bird '' and `` Turn Out The Light . ''
Justin Timberlake appears in the video dancing with the extras .
