Bush wrote this about the situation between the white Australians and the aborigines who were being wiped out by man 's greed for uranium .
White men were digging up aboriginal sacred grounds to get to the plutonium needed to build weapons that could one day destroy everything .
Traditional aboriginal instruments were used on this song .
The title comes from a religious period of time in the aboriginal culture known as Dreamtime , a time when animals and humans take the same form .
Dreamtime is also known as The Dreaming .
The Dreaming was Bush 's first completely solo produced album .
