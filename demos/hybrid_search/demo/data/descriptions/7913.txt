Crossfade lead singer Ed Sloan wrote their first single `` Cold '' about himself , but this song was about a specific person he was involved with .
In our 2011 interview with Sloan , he explained : `` She was a great person , but she would n't ever use her best qualities in life .
She would display her qualities to me , but then other times just completely go off the wagon , just be a completely different person , and be someone that people did n't like .
And so I guess that was me being my usual non-being-able-to-talk-to-somebody-straight-in-the-face self , and I wrote a song about it .
So it was kind of a song devoted to her , telling her , ` Look , you 've got friends and family that love you , and they 've always helped you out .
You ca n't just look them in the eye and say hey , thanks , and go on and keep doing what you 're doing .
You 've got to take responsibility for your life and right now these are n't the best colors that you ever shine .
You 've got beautiful colors inside of you , just let 'em out and let people know who you are . ' ''
