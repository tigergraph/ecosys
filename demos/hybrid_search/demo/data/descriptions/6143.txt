Joy Williams and John Paul White of The Civil Wars wrote this song in the studio behind Williams ' Nashville house on a warm summer day with the windows and doors open .
She explained that it `` is a sweet lament , of loss and the belief that you 'll never be able to love anybody else again . ''
When Williams and White were recording the song together , they could hear crows cawing in the background which Williams named Edgar , Allen and Poe .
She said : `` This recording and performance of the song is the first and only in existence , a work tape recorded simply on my iPhone . ''
The song was inspired by one of the Letters of Note , which Williams found on Twitter .
She explained : '' -LRB- I -RRB- was struck by the title of a letter written by a famous physicist named Richard Feynman : ' I love my wife .
My wife is dead . '
A little over a year after her death , he wrote his wife a love letter and sealed it .
It was written in 1946 , and was n't opened until after his death in 1988 .
He ended his note to his long-lost wife with ` Please excuse my not mailing this - but I do n't know your new address . ' ''
