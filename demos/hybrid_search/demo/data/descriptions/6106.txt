This emotional , soulful ballad is the second single from British R&B singer Estelle 's third studio album , All Of Me .
The song was written by Sengalese-American singer-songwriter Akon and produced by Jerry Wonda , whose resume includes Fugees hit version of Roberta Flack 's `` Killing Me Softly . ''
Wonda told The Boombox about the recording of the track : `` When we did that record , we just went in .
Akon officially wrote the top line , we just wanted to create something - a song you could listen to while you were driving , while you 're in the club , while you 're at work , while you 're taking five minutes out for yoga -LSB- laughs -RSB- !
Running !
A song that can fit it all . ''
Despite being heartbroken , the singer is grateful for the experience of the relationship that 's just ended .
Estelle told Rap-Up TV she fell in love with the track as soon as she heard it .
`` By the time it got to the chorus I was damn near crying , '' she said .
`` It just resonated so much with me .
I play it to my guy friends and they cry . ''
