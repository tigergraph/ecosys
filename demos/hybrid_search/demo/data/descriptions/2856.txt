A warlock is the male equivalent of a witch , and implies someone with mystical and magic powers .
This song seems to be about the power of music , complete with references to artists the Red Hot Chili Peppers admire .
Here are some possibilities : `` Subterranean '' - `` Subterranean Homesick Blues '' by Bob Dylan .
`` Jane '' - The band Jane 's Addiction .
`` Blow By Blow '' - An album by Jeff Beck `` Santa Monica '' - A song by Everclear.Beatlemania - a Beatles reference.Uncle Weezer - the band Weezer .
The line , `` I got a rockapotamus in my hand '' is a reference to the Chili Peppers ' fan club , Rockinfreakinpotamus .
Their song `` Good Time Boys '' also makes reference to it .
-LRB- thanks , Bert - Pueblo , NM -RRB- Billy Preston played clavinet on this song , and sadly it was the last song he played on before dying of kidney failure in 2006 .
Preston was an innovative keyboard player who performed with The Rolling Stones , Ray Charles , Little Richard , Elton John , Eric Clapton , Bob Dylan , Sam Cooke and many others in addition to his solo work .
He was best known for his work with The Beatles , and became the only non-Beatle to receive a credit on one of their songs when he contributed to `` Get Back . ''
His appearance on this song is appropriate , as Preston represents the music the Chili Peppers are embracing .
They make reference to Preston and The Beatles with the line , `` A little Beatlemania when I can . ''
