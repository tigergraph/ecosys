The lyrics for this piano-driven Rock number were written by frontman Justin Pierre during a break in songwriting when he was vacationing in Japan .
They tell the story of a stranger in a strange land , at the same time name-checking everything -- and everyone -- from Miami Vice to pulp magazine author Seabury Quinn .
Bass player Matt Taylor told Alternative Press : '' ` Pulp Fiction ' started as a mostly electronic idea I had recorded at home on my laptop .
I only had the verse and chorus parts at that time .
I sent it to Justin while he was on a solo trip in Japan to see if he liked it .
He put some vocals on it and immediately sent it back to me .
Then we played it for the band and everyone liked it , so we demoed the two parts with real drums , guitars , and bass .
We did n't have a bridge for the song until we got to pre-production with Mark -LSB- Hoppus , producer -RSB- . ''
