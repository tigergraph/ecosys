This bittersweet , Country-inspired number is Gabrielle Aplin 's first single release of her own material on a major label .
It finds the song 's protagonist admitting to her beau that she prefers taking relationships slowly .
`` Fools rush in and I 've been the fool before , '' Aplin sings on the bridge .
`` This time I 'm gon na slow down , 'cause I think this could be more .
The thing I 'm looking for . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Joshua Sanger , who previously helmed the clip for one of Aplin 's biggest on line hits , `` Home . ''
The visual tells the story of a young couple played by Iain De Caestecker -LRB- The Fades -RRB- and Ophelia Lovibond -LRB- London Boulevard , Mr Poppers Penguins -RRB- as a young couple with problems in their relationship , which we see when one demonstrates more affection than the other .
Aplin is the observer of the tricky situation .
The promo was shot on location at The Five Horseshoes country pub in Henley on Thames and the surrounding countryside .
`` We wanted to make this video a natural progression from the previous video for Home , '' said Sanger to Promo News .
`` It was evident that Please Do n't Say You Love Me has a strong narrative dialogue built into the song and so we felt a narrative approach was key to creating a video that complemented it . ''
