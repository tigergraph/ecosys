In this song , The Pussycat Dolls sing about a guy who impresses a girl and says all the right things , but wo n't make a move to take her clothes off and pursue a sexual encounter .
The guy might think he is being a gentleman , but the girl finds this behavior timid and would like him to assert himself .
Snoop Dogg raps on this at the beginning an end of the song .
At first , he is bragging to the girls about `` What he 's gon na do to them , '' and the lead Pussycat is skeptical .
She replies , `` I do n't see nothing yet . ''
He persuades her that he is serious , and both sides seem to be satisfied at the end of the song .
