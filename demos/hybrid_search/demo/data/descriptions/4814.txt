This evolved out of a practice riff the band used to tune Jim Lea 's violin before shows .
According to Noddy Holder , it took just 20 minutes to write .
They layered some chords over the distinctive riff , then ad-libbed some lyrics .
When they played it to manager/producer Chas Chandler the following morning , he booked a studio immediately .
The band 's manager Chas Chandler encouraged Slade to write their own material .
Noddy Holder says , `` He told us to write a hit song , just like that , and that 's not very easy to do .
Jimmy and me wrote ` Coz I Luv You ' in 20 minutes and Chaz was raving about it .
We felt that it was n't rocky enough for Slade so we added all the handclapping and boot-stomping , which made it much more commercial and became our trademark . ''
This was Slade 's second chart entry in Britain and their first # 1 .
Their first hit was a cover of a Little Richard song called `` Get Down And Get With It , '' which peaked at # 16 in the UK .
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England , for all above -RRB- Originally written as a ballad , the band toughened the song up by adding handclaps and stamping sounds .
The record 's title was misspelt as `` Coz I Luv You . ''
Noddy Holder : `` We thought ` Because I Love You ' was a wet title for a song and so we used the spelling that would be on toilet walls in the Midlands and that made it more hard-hitting .
When it went to # 1 , it gave us an enormous amount of confidence in our writing abilities .
We had the courage of our convictions that we could keep on doing it . ''
