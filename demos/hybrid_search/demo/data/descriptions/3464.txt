The American Saturday Night album is centered around the theme of living for the weekend .
Paisley told The Tennessean : `` I think that 's how my audience is living , and so ` American Saturday Night ' is that , and ` Water ' is that . ''
He added that even a dark song like this one , `` is that , which is about going out before you 're ready and is the first left turn the album takes .
It 's dark but everyone has been there . ''
