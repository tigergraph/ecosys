This is the second official single by British MC and rapper Devlin from his debut album , Bud , Sweat and Beers .
The track was released on January 31 , 2011 and features Simon Cowell 's urban protégé , Labrinth .
Labrinth told Digital Spy about the collaboration : `` He 's been bubbling on the underground scene for a long time now and I 've got a lot of respect for him .
We were initially introduced by our labels but he 's become a good friend now - he 's a great guy !
He reminds me of Eminem because he 's so honest about himself and what 's going on around him .
Even if he writes a love song , it 's written in his own way and he 's very opinionated . ''
