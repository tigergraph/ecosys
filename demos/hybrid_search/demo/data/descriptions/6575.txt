The first single from Jack Johnson 's sixth album From Here to Now to You is a fingerpicking ode to his wife , Kim .
Johnson married his college sweetheart on July 22 , 2000 , and he has previously written about her on such tracks as `` Angel '' `` Bubble Toes '' and `` Better Together . ''
The song talks about how Kim is the only person Jack truly needs in his life .
`` I got you , I got everything I 've got you , I do n't need nothing more than you I got everything , I 've got you . ''
Johnson explained to Radio.com the song represents where he is in life right now .
`` Even when life is n't always easy , it 's just nicer when you have somebody you can share it with , '' he said .
`` The hard times and the easy times . ''
The genesis of From Here to Now to You was when Johnson 's friend , David Crosby , introduced him to the unusual open B-flat guitar tuning .
`` He 's always showing me new tunings , saying , ` You 're going to find a whole bunch of new songs , ' '' Johnson told Rolling Stone .
`` That kind of made me want to start playing again , to be honest .
Johnson practiced the new tuning on a nylon-stringed classical guitar .
`` I started picking this thing up , '' he said .
`` I 'd never played much nylon string , and to feel that under my fingers , and then have this new tuning , it was kind of an inspiration that led to a lot of the sounds on the songs . ''
From Here To Now To You debuted at the top of the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart after selling 117,000 copies during its first week of release .
It also topped the Canadian album chart .
