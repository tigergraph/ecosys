This song is taken from the Dear Jack EP , which was released to accompany a documentary chronicling Jack 's Mannequin frontman Andrew McMahon 's personal fight against leukemia .
A portion of the proceeds went to his cancer research foundation .
McMahon explained to Spin magazine that Diane in this song , `` was my nurse in the first week that I was in New York , getting diagnosed .
It was really the only song that I wrote while I was in the hospital , probably on the second night that I was there , and did a demo of it a year or two later .
I love the song . ''
