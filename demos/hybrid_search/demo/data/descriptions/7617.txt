Heavy Metal pioneers Black Sabbath inspired this seven-minute track .
Songwriter and frontman Max Cavalera explained on his record label 's website : `` Honestly , it 's a thank you to Black Sabbath for being Black Sabbath .
It 's slow doom metal . ''
This track is a collaboration with French dub artist Fedaya Pacha .
Cavalera said of working with him : `` Fedaya makes dark , really heavy dub -- completely different from commercial dub .
He did the outro for ` Touching the Void , ' and he played a lot of weird instruments .
Those little things definitely make this song special when you listen to it . ''
