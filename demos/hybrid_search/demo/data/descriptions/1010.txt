This song expresses regret at losing a girl : Mary-Ann .
It describes how Mary-Ann was n't treated and appreciated as she should have been .
The butterfly is used as a metaphor : their feelings are paralleled to a butterfly because butterflies appear so peaceful and at ease .
It 's explained how feelings are `` locked up inside you . ''
But , the author says that he is a `` Butterfly in reverse , '' so this implies that he does n't feel at ease , does n't feel beautiful , and does n't feel peaceful - like the butterfly .
He 's in indecision over this girl .
In addition , the butterfly is compared to Mary-Ann and comes to represent her .
She is labeled as perfect , as is the butterfly .
This was written for the actress Mary-Louise Parker , whom Duritz dated back in the late 90s/early 2000s .
Other actresses whom Duritz dated and who inspired Counting Crows songs are , Courteney Cox-Arquette -LRB- `` Monkey '' -RRB- and Monica Potter -LRB- `` Mrs. Potter 's Lullaby '' -RRB- .
Hard Candy got its first breath of impetus from Adam Duritz ' work with Ryan Adams , and Adams returned the favor by co-writing and singing on this .
The song revels in the fields of syrupy symphonic Pop , complete with Burt Bacharach reference .
-LRB- thanks , John - Sydney , Australia , for above 2 -RRB-
