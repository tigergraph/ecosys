Alternative rock singer-songwriter Ben Harper 's tenth studio album , Give Till It 's Gone , was released in Italy on May 10 , 2011 and worldwide on May 17 , 2011 by Virgin Records .
The LP was preceded by this single , which was released as a free download on March 22 , 2011 .
The song is full of exhortations to grab life in the face of adversity .
Harper told The Huffington Post that its origins lie in a rock concert .
He explained : `` I was standing sidestage at a Neil Young concert - we had opened up for him at Hyde Park , in London , which is a great concert series overseas every summer .
He launched into ` Rockin ' In The Free World , ' and it was one of those moments where time starts to bend and things start to slow down around you - that usually starts to happen when I write a song , as everything tunes out except that moment of focus .
The song came in one bolt .
He was singing , ' ... keep on rockin ' in the free world , ' and all I kept hearing was , ` rock and free , rock and free , ' and that translated to me as rock is free because that 's kind of the modern day sentiment of ` Rockin ' In The Free World , ' in a way . ''
