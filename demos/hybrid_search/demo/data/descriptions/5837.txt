This self-empowerment anthem is one of eight co-writes by Carrie Underwood on Blown Away .
She penned the song with Hillary Lindsey and Luke Laird .
The Nashville songwriters have both collaborated with the American Idol alumni on several previous occasions , including her `` Last Name '' single .
The Country Pop life-affirming anthem finds Carrie reassuring young girls , `` You shine like a diamond and glitter like gold , '' before advising them to be `` free as a bird . ''
Some critics have accused Underwood of lacking authenticity , however the country superstar told Glamour magazine that being rich and famous does n't hurt the genuineness of her songs .
`` It would be very hard to write about my Louboutins ... my giant house , it 's not relatable , '' she said .
`` But my husband came from a small town and hardworking parents like I did , and I do n't think we 've lost that mind-set .
We do n't have a bowling alley in our basement .
We do n't have houses on the beach and one in New York and one in L.A. I drive a 3-year-old Ford Escape Hybrid .
We do n't care about stuff like that . ''
