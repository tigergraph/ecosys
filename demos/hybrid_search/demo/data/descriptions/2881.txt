Lana wrote this song after BBC Radio 1 started playing her first single `` Video Games '' .
She told The Sun : `` I was grateful that the song being on the radio brought some old friends back into my life -- especially one person . ''
Lana penned the lyrics and melody for the majority of the Born To Die tracks as she walked round Manhattan .
She then took them to her producer , Justin Parker , who helped her put the chords underneath .
However , this track was different as she improvised the words to Parker 's music .
She told The Sun : `` With the track ` Radio , ' Justin just held down long keys .
Sometimes what I ask my producers to do is just hold down long extended , melancholic notes and I end up just freestyling over them . ''
