Freddie Mercury was the principle composer of this song , though John Deacon contributed some of the chords and all 4 of the band members came up with lyrical ideas .
It was the fifth and last single from The Miracle album .
Freddie Mercury pleads during the song for `` Peace on Earth and end to war '' and a day `` when we can all be friends '' - Mercury has suggested peace on Earth throughout his career , but this is clearly the most noticeable use of the message , as it is the central theme of the song .
-LRB- thanks , James - Vancouver , Canada , for all above -RRB- This is a lighthearted song with simple lyrics .
Freddie Mercury sings of God 's magnificent creations and how beautiful they are , such as , `` The Taj Mahal , '' `` Test tube babies being born , '' `` the Hanging Gardens of Babylon , '' `` Captain Cook , '' `` Cain and Abel '' and `` Jimi Hendrix . ''
Many see this as not only Mercury 's appreciation of life so close to his eventual death , but as a subtle nod to Jimi Hendrix , who he has often cited as being an inspiration to him , Queen , and many others .
In Hard 'N' Heavy video magazine -LRB- 1989 , vol .
3 -RRB- , Brian May said : `` We got pasted to the wall for this in England .
Everybody hated it , for some reason .
It 's very uncool to be idealistic in Britain , I suppose , at the moment , and they said , ` How can they talk about peace , ' and all that sort of stuff , then of course , China happened and everything .
It seems very relevant to us .
`` Roger Taylor added : `` In England ` idealism ' is ` naivety , ' which is wrong , it 's not .
There 's nothing wrong with idealism .
Nick Lowe wrote that great song , great title - ` What 's so bad about peace , love and understanding , ' yeah , and what is so bad about . ''
