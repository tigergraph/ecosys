In 2007 , Josh Kelley married the actress Katherine Heigl , who for some reason did n't take his name and become the much more alliterative Katherine Kelley .
This song , which he wrote with Rachel Thibodeau and Kyle Jacobs , was inspired by her .
Says Kelley : `` Because of Katie 's and my different schedules , each time we have to leave each other , when we hug , neither one of us wants to let go .
I keep thinking , would n't it be great if I could just say , ` Forget it , I 'm staying . '
It 's interesting that when we were recording ` Do n't You Go , ' I initially sang in a higher octave , but it did n't covey the intensity the song deserved . ''
Georgia Clay was Kelley 's first Country album , and it was produced by Clint Lagerberg .
Said Kelley : `` My producer , Clint , really pushed me vocally on this album and this song in particular .
I really wanted the intensity to come through , and after about 45 takes we had a final version we were happy with .
In that final version , it is evident that Clint 's pushing me to perform the song in a higher pitch than I 'm used to really helped .
While he played acoustic guitar on ` Do n't You Go , ' he also provided backing electric guitar on this song and the rest of the album .
He 's one of the best guitarists I 've ever known . ''
