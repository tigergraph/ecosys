This soothing anthem finds Bareilles aiming for the sky in order to combat loneliness .
It was the first song that Bareilles wrote for The Blessed Unrest and it finds the singer-songwriter breaking from her pop mold to create something a little different .
`` It 's more like a poem set to music , '' she said to Radio.com of the song .
`` That song kind of gave me permission to play outside the box . ''
Like several other tracks in The Blessed Unrest , this was inspired by Bareilles ' new interest in astronomy .
`` This feels like a little bit of a new interest for me , '' she explained .
`` I think that I have a lot of awe of the universe and I think especially in terms of the natural beauty that surrounds us at all times . ''
