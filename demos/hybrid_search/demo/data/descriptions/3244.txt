This 45-verse depiction of the Titanic disaster is the title track of Bob Dylan 's thirty-fifth album .
It was inspired by the Carter Family 's folk song , `` The Great Titanic . ''
`` I was just fooling with that one night , '' Dylan told Rolling Stone .
`` I liked that melody - I liked it a lot .
` Maybe I 'm gon na appropriate this melody . '
But where would I go with it ?
`` Dylan made it clear that we should not read too much into the song , adding : `` I 'm just interested in showing you what happened , on the level that it happened on .
That 's all .
The meaning of it is beyond me . ''
The album 's title initially spurred rumors that it would be Dylan 's final album , based on its similarity to the title of Shakespeare 's final play .
Dylan later dismissed the suggestions .
`` Shakespeare 's last play was called The Tempest .
It was n't called just plain Tempest .
The name of my record is just plain Tempest .
It 's two different titles , '' he told Rolling Stone .
Dylan previously touched on the song 's subject matter in a line on `` Desolation Row '' when he sung , `` The Titanic sails at dawn . ''
It could be that the citing of DiCaprio 's character in Titanic is a case of returning James Cameron 's compliment , as Jack Dawson twice quotes Dylan songs in the movie .
At one point he states `` I 'm just a tumbleweed blowin ' in the wind and elsewhere Dawson virtually quotes a line from `` Like a Rolling Stone '' when he says , `` when you got nothing , you got nothing to lose . ''
Though based on the tragic events , not all the song is grounded in fact .
There is a fictional character Jim Dandy , for instance , who unable to swim hands over a chance at survival to a crippled child .
We also hear of exaggerated carnage on the ship 's decks .
-LRB- `` Brother rose up against brother .
They fought and slaughtered each other . '' -RRB- .
`` People are going to say , ` Well , it 's not very truthful , ' said Dylan to Rolling Stone .
`` But a songwriter does n't care about what 's truthful .
What he cares about is what should 've happened , what could 've happened .
That 's its own kind of truth .
It 's like people who read Shakespeare plays , but they never see a Shakespeare play .
I think they just use his name . ''
The song pays tribute to James Cameron 's hit 1997 film version by referencing Kate Winslet 's character , Rose , in the opening verse : -LRB- `` The pale moon rose in its glory .
Out on the western town .
She told a sad , sad story .
Of the great ship that went down . '' -RRB- .
Dylan later namechecks actor Leo DiCaprio , who portrayed Roses 's love interest , Jack Dawson .
Regarding the latter , Dylan commented to Rolling Stone .
`` Yeah , Leo .
I do n't think the song would be the same without him . ''
Here are three more songs we have on our database about the Titanic : `` Band Played On '' by Joe Walsh .
`` S.O.S. '' by Saxon.And of course : `` My Heart Will Go On '' by Celine Dion .
Was Dylan , who of course was born Robert Zimmerman , aware that one of the doomed passengers on board the Titanic was one Leo Zimmerman ?
The 29-year-old Farmer from Todtmoos , Germany , boarded the liner at Southampton as a third class passenger and died in the sinking .
