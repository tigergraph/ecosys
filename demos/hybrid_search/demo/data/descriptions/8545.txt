Taken by Trees is the solo project of Victoria Bergsman , who is best known to many for her back-ups on Peter , Bjorn and John 's hit Young Folks .
Bergsman travelled to Pakistan to record her second album , East of Eden .
The bulk of the record 's support came from local Pakistani musicians but to Bergsman 's regret for cultural reasons , she was unable to get any female musicians involved .
The Swedish musician was pleased , then , to recruit the seven-year-old Sodhagar Ali to sing about his mother on this traditional track .
