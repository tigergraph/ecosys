Joel wrote this with Ronnie Spector in mind , which he talked about on The Howard Stern Show , where he also explained that it 's written in a high key and challenging to sing - he had an easier time hitting those notes when he wrote the song .
As for Spector , he was a big fan of her and loved the girl-group sound she exemplified .
He met her a few times over the years , but only after he wrote the song .
This was released in the US as the B-side to `` I 've Loved These Days '' a month before it was put out as an A-side .
Neither song charted , but in 1981 , a live version recorded at the Milwaukee Arena was released on Joel 's Songs In The Attic album and hit # 17 in the US .
Songs In The Attic was the first digitally-recorded live album .
Joel had recently moved from Los Angeles to New York , which helped inspire this song .
He is from Long Island , and did not like life on the West Coast .
Ronnie Spector , who was the inspiration for this song and leader of the popular girl-group , The Ronettes , recorded this song in 1977 .
She said at the time : `` In a way it 's my life story 'cause I was married in Hollywood , I lived in Hollywood , my life fell apart in Hollywood and now I am saying goodbye to Hollywood .
`` Spector 's version was produced by Little Steven Van Zandt , who she met while singing backup for Bruce Springsteen in 1976 .
Springsteen 's E-Street Band played backup for her .
