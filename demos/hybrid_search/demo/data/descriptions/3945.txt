Cabo San Lucas is a Mexican city and holiday destination on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsular .
Toby Keith explained on the press release for That Do n't Make Me a Bad Guy why Eddy Raven was one of his heroes in his youth : `` Eddy is one of the most underrated artists of the '80s .
He wrote great songs , sang great , was really unique and had a great style , I thought .
He probably was n't hard country enough for the times .
It had n't evolved to where it is today . ''
Keith wrote this together with one of the heroes of his youth , singer-songwriter Eddy Raven .
He told AOL : `` I 'd always been an Eddy Raven fan , and when I did ` How Do You Like Me Now ?! ' I had people that had worked with him say the vocal reminded them of Eddy Raven .
I said , ` Well , it ought to , because I sang about everything that he did , cover stuff . '
`` The twosome hooked up together and hit it off as friends , before deciding to write a few songs together .
Keith told AOL : `` He knew that I loved Cabo San Lucas .
He had a little idea about it .
We sat down and put it in Eddy Raven mode .
You could hear him sing this if I was n't on the vocal .
He added : `` It 's really cool to be at this position in my life .
When you 're sitting on top of your world and having so much good going on in your life , you get to start fulfilling some of these things that you always wanted to do but never got to do .
Getting to hang out with him for a weekend and write was really cool . ''
