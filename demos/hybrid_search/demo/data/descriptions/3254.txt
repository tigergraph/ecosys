This was written by Sugababe Keisha Buchanan about her first ever serious boyfriend with whom she split up with in 2006 .
Keisha says in the Daily Mail September 28 , 2007 , `` I was an adult in my childhood and had a grown-up 's business head on my shoulders .
But the backlash was me trying to hold on to my childhood and waiting for as long as possible for the right man .
It was a mistake , as I had my heart broken .
I 've written a song on the album called ` Undignified ' and it describes how I behaved like a teenager because I was so in love .
I 'm happy to be single and celibate now , but I learned to grow up through the pain that relationship caused me . ''
