Vocalist Joel Madden 's lyrics for this song are about his first child Harlow Winter Kate Madden , who was born January 11 , 2008 .
His brother , guitarist Benji Madden told Spin magazine : `` I got chills the first time I heard it .
I could tell he meant every word .
It 's really cool to see my brother digging deep and writing from the heart .
When Joel told me he was going be a Dad , I was psyched .
Joel ?
He 's the rock star !
When you see Joel step on stage ... he 's born to be a rock star .
But he 's also the best father I know .
He wrote about the love he has for his kids and his girl Nicole -LSB- Richie -RSB- .
He 's really found himself through his family .
When I have a family - and I definitely want to - I want it to be like his . ''
Originally , Joel intended this song to be a lullaby just for his daughter , but Benji loved its raw emotion and insisted it went on the album .
Joel explained to PopEater that his new role of parent influenced the writing of the album . ''
-LSB- There 's -RSB- a song that I wrote for my daughter called ` Harlow 's Song , ' and it was originally like a lullaby , and then -LSB- Benji -RSB- heard it and really liked it , and the guys heard it and they all liked it , '' Joel says .
`` I 've never written a song like that .
It was pretty interesting .
It 's like a straight love song for somebody .
It 's a lullaby , and it ended up being on the record .
I 've never really had the ability to write songs like that .
So I guess my life has changed a lot . ''
