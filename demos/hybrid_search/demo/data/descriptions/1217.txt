Serge Pizzorno , who is the guitarist and principal songwriter in Kasabian , told Q magazine : `` This is a really simple song , just guitar , bass and drums .
It 's traditional and perfect in a weird way .
There 's a bit of a bluesy , country feel to it .
If you know the band or hang around with us it will make sense .
Come round mine for a smash-up and you 'll get some Roy Orbison , you know what I mean . ''
Many of the lyrics on Velociraptor !
are yearnings for the far-off days when the Kasabian quartet were young .
For instance , the pay off in this song finds Tom Meighan singing , `` I see no future so leave me alone in the past . ''
He told NME : `` That 's a great line .
It 's not , ' I wan na live in the '60s or whatever .
It 's just we 're at that age and reflecting on what 's happened since we were young .
We 're going through all the memories and we 're looking back .
Maybe it 's because we 've got families . ''
