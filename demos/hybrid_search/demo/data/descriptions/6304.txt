Sandwich was Psychostick 's second studio album .
Their guitarist Josh Key told us : `` There are actually several songs off the album that are special not really for the song content , but the time period in which they were written .
Half of this album was written before we started touring , and it was a BAD year for me .
I had lost my job making 40k a year and went to working at a Circle K with debts of several thousand dollars .
What kept me going was the thought of someday recording those songs on a new Psychostick album .
Hearing these songs played back to me is proof that I made it , and that I 'll make it through the next bad times . ''
