Lead singer and primary lyricist Max Bemis explained this track to Alternative Press : `` This is kind of a funny song and a little schizophrenic because it was written very organically .
When I was writing it , I had no idea what was going to come out of me .
I told myself I wanted to write one song on the record that had a million different parts , kind of like our old records as we had so many streamlined songs .
The ideas would be more alike and would come in the same way as they evolve and start in one place and end in another .
This song is a turning point on the record .
I start out feeling sorry for myself , alienated as usual .
Then I have this realization that it 's not really doing anything for me .
I see what 's wrong with the world and that I want to change .
I see the things that make me feel inadequate and realize that I ca n't let that consume me just because those things make me feel different .
I start to pull myself out of the riot and examine my life and empower myself .
I start to throw a middle finger up at the things I ca n't change .
The song really talks about accepting the things you can change and letting go of the things you can not .
There are certain things in my past - whether it 's my bipolar disorder or how I grew up or how things were done wrong to me by other people - which I had to accept as not my fault .
There were other things that I was doing to myself and other things that were my doing and my responsibility .
I had to differentiate between those things .
I had to take responsibility and move on and do things differently when I can . ''
