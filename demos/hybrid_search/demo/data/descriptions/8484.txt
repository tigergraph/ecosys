This was released as the second single from the Drums ' second album Portamento .
The Patrick Roberts directed video was recorded whilst the band were in London . ''
-LSB- London -RSB- is a place that brings me a good level of comfort and at the same time keeps me on edge , which I think any great city should do , '' said frontman Jonny Pierce .
`` We took three days for filming which happened to be the same three days that we were playing a few small intimate shows around London .
It made us a bit nostalgic because it was just like the first time we came to London as a band , and our worlds changed forever . ''
Said Patrick Roberts : `` For Jonny , this is a very personal song .
We wanted to convey a tone of recollection , memory , and longing .
While the lyrical content could refer to a person , we wanted to play with the idea that it could also refer to a place.We chose to incorporate figures that were ghostly , painterly , and saturated in color .
We wanted a video that retained a sense of human touch .
Something visceral and intimate . ''
