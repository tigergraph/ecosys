`` When you do something honorable for somebody , it lives on through that person , '' Hatebreed lead singer Jamey Jasta says by way of explaining this track .
He got the idea for the song when he was visiting his grandfather in a veteran 's hospital .
He was talking to another patient , and was later told that this man had n't had a visitor in over a year .
This is when Jamey realized that you could be a war hero , yet still die alone .
As this song was coming together in the studio , the band knew they had something special .
Jasta says they took a different approach in writing it .
He told us : `` That 's the first song that I suggested we do two different guitar lines and a different bass line - and never follow everybody playing the same notes .
And I think it gives an interesting sound - we 've never done that before as a band .
It gives an interesting temp change and mood shift from the riff in the verse to the chorus . ''
In our interview with Jamey Jasta , he explained : `` I was n't coming from a place of anger , but I 'm screaming in this aggressive way .
I just wanted to have it represent the passion I felt about the topic . ''
