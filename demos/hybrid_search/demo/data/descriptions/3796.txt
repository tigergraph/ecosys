This was a throwaway song that became INXS ' biggest hit .
Andrew Farriss came up with the riff , and Michael Hutchence quickly added some lustful lyrics .
This was featured in the 2000 film Coyote Ugly .
Farriss had the idea for the riff for this song while waiting for a taxi to take him to the airport .
He asked the taxi driver to wait for a couple of minutes as he 'd left something behind in the motel .
He kept the unfortunate taxi driver waiting for an hour while he quickly recorded the riff and eventually returned to a very frustrated driver with a tape .
Kick is the best-selling INXS album , selling more than 7 million copies in the US alone .
Other US Top-10 hits include `` Devil Inside , '' `` New Sensation '' and `` Never Tear Us Apart . ''
