This song was inspired by Amy Winehouse ; the Stereophonics had hoped she would record it before her unexpected death in July 2011 .
Frontman Kelly Jones told The Daily Star : `` I read an article about Amy 's love life and the line ` Been caught cheating ' came to me .
I 'd said hello to Amy at festivals and then I bumped into her at a record company party where she was with her fella Reg Traviss .
I 've met Reg a couple of times since Amy died ; he 's a lovely guy .
We got talking about songwriting and Amy was up for me sending her this song , but I never got round to it .
`` The band eventually recorded the song for their eighth studio album Graffiti on the Train .
`` I thought it was too bluesy for Stereophonics to play but it 's come out really raw and tough , '' said Jones .
British singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse 's untimely demise shocked the music community and a number of musicians penned tribute songs to her .
They include : `` Amy '' by Green Day .
`` Paperchase '' by Paul Weller .
`` This is the Girl '' by Patti Smith .
