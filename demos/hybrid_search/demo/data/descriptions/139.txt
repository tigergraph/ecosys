Not only does this mainly acoustic track close A Dramatic Turn Of Events , but it was the last song written for the album .
Guitarist and producer John Petrucci told Musicradar.com : `` We had tracked all of the drums on the other cuts , and I think we were working on keyboards .
At this point , we realized that the record needed something .
Everything else was very intense , so a cool-down felt right .
With the exception of ` This Is The Life , ' I was writing about very heavy topics : political unrest in America , uprisings in the Middle East , ancient Persian armies , shamans .
For the closing song , a lighter , more poignant lyrical message was in order , something that would reach deep into your soul in a very honest way.Actually , I wrote the lyrics without the music ; it was before we even went into the studio .
Once we started working on the song , I had a guitar part that seemed like it would work , but I ended up changing it around .
There was a bit of a process with marrying the words to the music .
I demoed the song and recorded it , and the guys were totally open to it . ''
Petrucci on the song 's arrangement : `` It 's mostly acoustic , and it could exist as an acoustic/vocal song .
We did put an arrangement to it .
I really like the keyboard solo in the middle .
We searched for just the right Moog-esque sound , picturing the lighters , or I guess cell phones , coming out in the audience .
It takes it away from being a folkish ballad and makes it more Genesis or ELP .
I love it .
I think it 's a great way to end the record . ''
