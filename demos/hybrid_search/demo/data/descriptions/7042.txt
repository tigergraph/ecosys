The lyrics for this song were written by Mitch Albom , a sports columnist for the Detroit Free Press and bestselling author -LRB- Tuesdays with Morrie , The Five People You Meet in Heaven -RRB- , and a longtime friend of Zevon .
Buddy , the song 's protagonist , is neither a real NHL player nor based upon one .
This may be just as well , because the `` enforcer '' role to which he is consigned in the song appears to be dying out in the real-life NHL , as a recent set of rule changes has placed greater emphasis on speed and playmaking skills , meaning nowadays most NHL teams can no longer say , `` There 's always room on our team for a goon . ''
The 2002 album My Ride 's Here was regarded as a comeback album of sorts for Warren Zevon ; although he had remained active as a singer/songwriter for many years , this album was regarded as one of his best since the peak years of his career in the late 1970s .
Sadly , Zevon 's comeback was cut short later that year when he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer .
He passed away the following year , but not before recording one more album , The Wind .
-LRB- thanks , Joshua - Twin Cities , MN , for all above -RRB- This is the ballad of an ice hockey player named Buddy -LRB- his last name is never given -RRB- who realizes his dream of playing in the National Hockey League , but not quite in the way he 'd envisioned .
Instead of being a star playmaker , Buddy is relegated to the much less glamorous role of enforcer .
Over the course of his career he becomes feared by players and loved by fans as `` The king of the goons , '' but secretly continues to harbor a dream of scoring a goal .
He finally gets his wish in the closing seconds of the last game of his career , but never gets the opportunity to savor the moment , as he is knocked out cold by an opposing player just after he shoots the puck .
Another famous friend of Zevon , David Letterman , is the one yelling `` Hit somebody ! ''
in the song 's chorus .
