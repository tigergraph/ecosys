Lead guitarist Will Nutter -LRB- from The Alternative Press -RRB- : `` I initially wrote this song about a personal relationship of mine that recently ended .
The song was -LSB- originally -RSB- nasty and mean , and I did n't feel comfortable putting that out there for everyone to hear , so I made a few changes .
I think the message is the same but it 's a little more discreet . ''
