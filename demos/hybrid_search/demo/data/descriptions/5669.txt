Guitarist Joe Satriani described his original demo of this song to MusicRadar.com as `` Rock meets Hip-Hop . ''
He explained : `` The rhythm figures during the bridge section were spooky , these harmonized notes played me scraping the pick on the string down by the bridge .
This was set to an old Linn Drum loop , so it was very controlled , stream-of-consciousness guitars set to this old-school , rock/hip-hop rhythm .
`` Satriani continued : `` The guys were trying to figure out how to play it , so they basically decided not to .
-LSB- laughs -RSB- They went at it like it AC/DC , Aerosmith , Chickenfoot , whatever .
As we were tracking , I realized that I could n't play the spooky parts anymore - I had to make them more bluesy . ''
Satriani told MusicRadar.com about the song 's lyrical content : `` Lyrically , Sammy -LRB- Hagar -RRB- went for a story told in blues folklore , about a guy complaining that he 's got everything in the world except for the girl he loves .
There 's a lot of songs that have been based around the same tale , but Sam did it in a way that tips the hat to blues roots . ''
