This string-laden ballad about love , family and commitment is the first single off English soul and R&B singer-songwriter Seal 's sixth studio album , Seal 6 : Commitment .
Seal said `` Everything about my life is fully committed .
I 've never felt more focused on the matter at hand : My wife -LSB- Heidi Klum -RSB- , my children , the family in general , my own well-being and , of course , music and my career .
Each one of these songs has personal meaning for me .
I dug very deep and all I can hope for is that the music strikes a chord with people . ''
Seal and his wife Heidi Klum have four children and one of them figures in this song .
Seal explained to Reuters : `` There 's a chapter in that song that is directly related to our first child , Lenni .
If you listen to it , you 'll know which one it is .
But I try not to be too specific because it takes away the ability for people to relate and make it their own . ''
