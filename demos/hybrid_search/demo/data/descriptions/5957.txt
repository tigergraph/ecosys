In the song , Fiona speaks of her `` big secret . ''
She has explained it as being in reference to the way other students viewed her during high school .
It was Fiona 's response to the question of `` What 's the big secret ? ''
Apple : `` When I was in high school a lot of guys did n't ... a lot of guys always ... this is what I heard the most -- okay ... ` What the hell are you thinking ? '
` What are you thinking about ? '
` God , you 're always staring off into space . '
And , like , no one would come near me because of that and I think that people think that if you 're silent then you 're like , snobby or something , you know ?
Or you 're depressed .
You know ?
I was just contemplative .
What can I say ? ''
