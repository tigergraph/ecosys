This song is a tribute to Lucia Pamela , a highly eccentric American musician .
She released one album , Into Outer Space with Lucia Pamela , in 1969 -LRB- re-released in 1992 -RRB- which was mostly about an imaginary trip to the moon .
-LRB- She insisted the album was actually recorded on the moon -RRB- .
She also produced a cartoon coloring book called Into Outer Space with Lucia Pamela in the Year 2000 .
