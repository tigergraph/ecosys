The English singer-songwriter Laura Marling 's fourth album takes its name from this pointed dispatch to a former flame , in which she describes herself as an eagle symbolising empowerment .
The record acts as a song-cycle , which recognizes the complex dynamics operating in relationships as Marling charts various responses to emotional upset .
Marling was asked by Radar magazine if she is simply adopting characters for the songs ?
`` I 'm creating characters to say certain things , '' she admitted .
`` There is a story to it , but it 's not a true story .
It 's a kind of narrative , but everything is from my experience , because that 's what I know - I 'm not a great fiction writer . ''
During an interview with The Daily Telegraph , the comment was made that there is something very tough and self-possessed about Marling , reflected in lyrical imagery where she casts herself as an eagle , a Beast and a Master Hunter .
`` I suppose it is my nature .
I feel more akin to something aggressive rather than delicate . ''
the singer said , adding that she is by nature an over-thinker , but , `` I 'm sort of at peace with it .
I enjoy living in perpetual cognitive justification . ''
Once I Was An Eagle was recorded at the Three Crows studio owned by Marling 's producer and instrumentalist Ethan Johns -LRB- Kings of Leon , Ryan Adams , Michael Kiwanuka -RRB- , with Dom Monks on engineering duties .
