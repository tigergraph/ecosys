This was released as the second single from Jake Bugg 's eponymous debut album .
It 's one of several on the record for which Bugg drew on his own life experiences .
He told The Sun : `` As a songwriter , it 's good to write about what you see but it 's also nice to use your imagination a bit . ''
Bugg wrote this in his bedroom .
He recalled : `` I had nothing to do , came up with a few chords , three chords .
What I wanted to do , I did n't have a job , I left school I was living on a council estate just wanted to write a song a fantasy , really just place yourself somewhere else .
It 's a way of escaping not in the sense of ` Two Fingers ' or ` Trouble Town ' is about , but more psychological .
The song was used in the UK to soundtrack a national TV beer commercial for Greene King IPA .
