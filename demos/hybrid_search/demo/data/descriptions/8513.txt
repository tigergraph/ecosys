The second single from Anberlin 's third album Cities finds Stephen Christian singing of somebody too fixed on worrying about the future rather than enjoying the present .
Speaking in a 2012 interview , Stephen Christian told us he wrote the song in Seattle , Washington .
He explained : `` The message behind it was that there was somebody in my life that had it so very well , so well .
But they could n't see it .
They were basically in such a turmoil to get to the future that they did n't realize what they had in the present .
So instead of focusing on that , they focused on this internal self absorbed place that , instead of saying , ` Wow , I live in Seattle , Washington , I have this incredible job , I have these beautiful friends around me , ' instead we 're saying , ` I 'm so scared of the future , I do n't know what 's going to happen , my life is horrible , I 'm in such a dark place . '
`` And it was just one of those moments where you just need to stop , '' he continued .
`` Just stop everything , take a giant step back and re-evaluate your life and what you have now and stop focusing on a future that no one can ever predict .
No one can tell you what tomorrow brings , so why worry ?
Do n't worry about tomorrow , you did that yesterday .
That 's the whole basis of the song . ''
The Walmart exclusive version of Anberlin 's No Surrender album features an acoustic version of this song .
This was originally written as a segue between two of the tracks on Cities , but Christian and guitarist Joseph Milligan liked it so much they turned it into an entire song .
The song is played during the opening of the 2008 horror film House , which was based on the book by Christian fiction authors Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker .
