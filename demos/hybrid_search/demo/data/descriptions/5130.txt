This is the title track of the fifth studio album by American mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan .
Speaking with Raymond Westland of Ghost Cult magazine , guitarist/co-founder Ben Weinman said the record `` is more or less a concept album . ''
He explained : `` A lot of the theme has do with how , as you get older you stop pointing your finger at everyone else for your frustrations and difficulties and you start looking more inward , realizing that you 're responsible for your own happiness and relationships in this world .
That 's the central theme that most of the songs and the lyrics revolve around . ''
Weinman told Ghost Cult magazine why the band named the record after this track : `` We chose the title of one of the songs on the album , '' he explained , `` which is about the difficulties of maintaining relationships , especially for people in an active band like us .
That 's always a major challenge .
That also goes for the relationships within the band .
Constant instability can be a threat , especially in the relationship between Greg -LRB- Puciato , vocals -RRB- and I. We 're so dependent on each other , especially in the creative aspect , but we 're also such different people .
Maintaining such a relationship is a constant battle , even when you do n't realise it . ''
