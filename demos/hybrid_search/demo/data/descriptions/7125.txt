Talking Heads drummer Chris Frantz is a fan of Funk , and it was a P-Funk show in New York City that inspired this track .
When he heard the crowd imploring the band to `` Burn Down The House '' -LRB- this is before `` The Roof Is on Fire '' -RRB- , he got the idea for the title .
As he explained in a 1984 interview with National Public Radio -LRB- NPR -RRB- , he and Talking Heads bassist Tina Weymouth , who is also his wife , created the original track in a jam , then took it to the band where they refined the groove .
To form the lyrics , they picked words that fit the rhythms , which is why the words do n't make a lot of sense .
This is common practice in the world of Funk , where you do n't want the lyric to get in the way of the groove on a feel good song .
The small version of David Byrne in the video was played by Max Illidge , who was 12 years old at the time and grew up to be the lead singer of a group called 40 Below Summer .
The house in the video was located in Union , New Jersey .
With a lot of help from MTV , who gave the video a lot of play , this song became Talking Heads biggest hit .
It did n't get a great deal of radio play at the time , but has endured as an '80s classic and is often used in movies and TV shows , including Gilmore Girls , 13 Going on 30 , Six Feet Under , Revenge of the Nerds and Someone Like You .
Talking Heads also performed it in their 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense .
