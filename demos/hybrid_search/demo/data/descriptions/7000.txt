After flopping with the David Guetta produced club tune `` Freak , '' the English R&B singer and rapper Estelle returned to her R&B roots with this number .
The lead single from her third album All of Me , this breezy mid-tempo tune was produced by Don Cannon and features Aston Martin Music rapper Rick Ross .
The video was shot in Malibu , California and co-directed by Iren Brown and Chris Robinson .
It co-stars Rick Ross and actor Omari Hardwick -LRB- For Colored Girls -RRB- , who plays Estelle 's love interest .
She said : `` The basic concept is I 'm rolling up to this house and I 'm having a dinner party , but I invited this guy that I 'm trying to get it on with .
The entire time I 'm thinking about him , but in my heart I 'm doubting , maybe he 'll break my heart .
I pray he does n't break my heart . ''
Estelle released two versions of the remix , one containing Swizz Beatz , Raekwon and Rich 32 for the UK market and a second featuring the British songstress spitting bars with Busta Rhymes and Jadakiss for the US .
Estelle began her career as a rapper and she told The Boombox she had no problem returning to her rapping roots .
`` I started as a rapper , my first album -LSB- The 18th Day -RSB- was damn near all rap , so people know me as a rapper from home , '' she said .
`` This was n't scary , I enjoyed rapping again .
I felt like I needed to spit some bars . ''
