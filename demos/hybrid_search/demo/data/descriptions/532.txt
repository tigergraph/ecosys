The song is a setting of William Blake 's 1794 poem , The Poison Tree .
The work was part of Blake 's collection , Songs of Experience , in which he considered the nature of evil .
The non-conformist mystic was protesting against what he considered to be the puritanical Christianity of his day , which he felt repressed `` sinful '' emotions in people .
Blake 's poison tree was a metaphor for his anger , which he 'd allowed to be stifled rather than expressed .
As a result , his wrath grew until it `` bore an apple bright . ''
The poem concludes with the line , `` my foe outstretched beneath the tree . ''
Beth Orton suffers from Crohn 's disease , an inflammatory bowel condition that can cause chronic pain .
For many years she tried to ignore the disease , but when she gave birth to her daughter in December 2006 , Orton needed to express her discomfort .
She told The Independent : `` I was in incredible pain for all of my twenties , and some of my thirties .
I was in pain every single day .
Do you know when I realised ?
When I had Nancy , I had an emergency Caesarian and somebody came to visit me , and I did n't know how to say I 'm in pain .
And that is what ` Poison Tree ' is all about . ''
