The idea for this track came to Chris August in the shower .
He explained the background to the song in an interview with New Release Tuesday : `` I was thinking about how each day I pray to God for focus .
It hit me one day that my words were wrong .
I need to say , ` Lord I accept Your focus . '
That 's something He 's always giving us .
It 's not something He starts and stops giving .
We just have to choose to accept God 's direction in our lives each day .
That got me to stop and think about choosing to accept God 's focus in our lives is a daily decision .
We put pressure and rules on ourselves as Christians .
Even just in life if you are trying to make moral decisions apart from following Christ , you have daily ` battles . ' ''
August told New Release Tuesday that the real message of the song is that we all face everyday battles - eating the right food , spending money the right way ... `` and it hit me that the beauty of all of these battles we fight is that the war was already won when Christ died for our sins on the Cross .
`` He continued : `` At the end of the day , that 's what it 's about .
Our human nature is that we have pride , and we hate when we mess up .
The Bible tells us we 'll all fall short of the glory of God .
Character comes in when you repent and what you do after you mess up .
My hope is that I can keep my focus on the war that was already won by Jesus Christ in my lifeThat 's where healing comes from when we face those daily battles .
I would love for people to experience that same healing when they listen to this song .
Take the hope given to us by Jesus and know that the Cross was for people in the midst of sin .
`` While we were still sinners , Christ died for us . ''
Live for Him . ''
