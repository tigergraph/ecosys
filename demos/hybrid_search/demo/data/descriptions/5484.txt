Swift wrote this love-gone-wrong song with singer-songwriter Colbie Caillat , who also sings on the track .
Swift told That 's Country how she hooked up with the Californian : `` I was a huge fan of Colbie 's record .
When it came out , I fell in love with the way that she makes music .
I contacted her management right away and I asked if I could write with her and , sure enough , Colbie had a date coming up in Nashville where she was going to be playing a show and she had the day off .
I think she sounds beautiful on it .
I 'm so excited to have her voice on my album . ''
Colbie Caillat told The Associated Press about their collaboration : `` I went to Nashville about a year and a half ago , and she wanted to write with me , and I flew there and we worked on the songs on morning and she had this beautiful song started and it 's about having to let someone go and say goodbye to a really good friend .
And we became friends after that .
She is so sweet , so beautiful , so talented and honestly just a really intelligent young women .
She knows what she is doing and she knows how to handle her career and take charge .
I love her . ''
Swift explained to That 's Country that this tune is , `` a song about having to say goodbye to somebody , but it never blames anybody .
Sometimes that 's the most difficult part .
When it 's nobody 's fault . ''
