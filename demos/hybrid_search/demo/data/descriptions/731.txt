This is one of several party songs on American Saturday Night .
Paisley explained to Billboard magazine : `` I wanted to deal with the weekend scene in America , which is what people are living for these days .
Those of us that still have jobs are living for Friday and Saturday .
They are going to live it up . ''
He added that this song , `` is really an almost Johnny Cash-meets-Merle Haggard , pick-up line song .
The chorus says , ` It takes two to make love , baby .
I 'm sure of that .
I 'm one , you 're one , you do the math . '
It 's really fun .
It starts out mono .
It sounds like 1960 and then all of a sudden it goes stereo and it 's neat to hear . ''
Billboard asked Paisley what the writing sessions were like for American Saturday Night .
He replied : `` We wrote most of this at the farm .
Between -LSB- Kelley Lovelace 's -RSB- house and my house , we have this old guest house that I 've converted into a studio and writing area .
We always get together there .
There was one night back in December , in the living room was me , Chris -LSB- DuBois -RSB- and Ashley -LSB- Gorley -RSB- finishing up ` Then . '
In the other room , Robert Arthur and Tim Owens were thinking of another first verse for a song we had written called ` You Do The Math ' .
Kelley was upstairs by himself writing something that he and I and Chris had been working on .
I 've never had more fun . ''
