This is the title track of the third album released by the British band These New Puritans .
Frontman Jack Barnett explained the album name to NME : '' ` Field Of Reeds ' is something from the Egyptian Book Of The Dead , '' he said .
`` It 's the equivalent of heaven , but where it differs is that you live the same day over and over .
Eternally . ''
