In this cover of the song by sigur rós , W.A.S. recorded the song entirely from phonics .
`` Hoppipolla '' is written in Icelandic , and lead singer Keith Murray could n't perform it again , even if he had the hankering ; he does n't speak the language.It was a serendipitous event that brought this song to life for We Are Scientists in a bar in a London hotel .
Keith says , `` Somehow there was an Icelandic woman in the group we were hanging out with .
So she wrote down the lyrics to it and then we took a look at this and we 're like , ` Uh , that 's not gon na work . '
And then we all got together and wrote them down phonetically with her .
She told us what he was saying , but I could n't tell you what any one word meant .
I was just singing the phonetics of it .
We get asked to do it a lot live , and there 's no way I would ever be able to sing that song live .
I have zero recollection of what the words are . ''
Sigur rós hail from Iceland , and `` rightly claim to bring you the beautiful landscape of their homeland with their music , '' their Web site trumpets .
If this song is any indication , their media is correct .
Still , the W.A.S. version of the song has a slightly more haunting quality .
They did it justice , even if they had no clue what the words meant .
`` There are a bunch of sigur rós songs that are just in their own invented language , '' claims Keith Murray .
`` But this is one of the few songs that 's actually in a real language .
This one is actually in Icelandic . ''
