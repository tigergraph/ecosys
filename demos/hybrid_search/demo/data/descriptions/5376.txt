This song refers to the relationship between Adam Lazzara and former Taking Back Sunday and Straylight member John Nolan 's sister -LRB- who is also is the band -RRB- Michelle Nolan .
Even though the story goes that Adam cheated on Michelle while on tour , this implies that there is more to the story and Michelle might have had a role in the ending of their relationship .
In the song , he is giving up on this girl that he loves because of problems contributed by both of them .
He is trying to tell her he loves her , but it does n't make a difference what they do because it wo n't work out .
-LRB- thanks , Amina - Toronto , Canada -RRB-
