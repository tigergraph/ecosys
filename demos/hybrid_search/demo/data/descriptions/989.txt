The lead single from Cuban-American singer-songwriter Gloria Estefan 's eleventh studio album , Miss Little Havana , was produced by Pharrell Williams and the singer 's longtime collaborator and husband , Emilio Estefan Jr. .
The song was released on July 24 , 2011 and was Gloria 's first commercial release to the English-market since `` I Wish You '' back in 2003 .
According to Estefan , `` Wepa '' is an expression like `` wow '' or `` hey , '' which is used mostly by Puerto Ricans and Colombians .
Estefan explained the song 's meaning to Billboard magazine : `` It 's about how the working man and anybody have a great time with music and dance ... I wanted to give it a very carnival , festival feeling , the type you hear in street parties in Brazil and Cuba , that people would go down the streets dancing to , just a crazy Caribbean feel to it . ''
A second version was recorded by Gloria for the deluxe edition of Miss Little Havana with rapper Pitbull .
The two Cuban-Americans previously worked together on a remix of Estefan 's 2007 Spanish language single `` No Llores . ''
