This rollicking party tune was written by Clint Lagerberg and Craig Wiseman .
Shelton noted to Wendy Geller of Yahoo Music : `` I love the sarcasm of that song .
I love the feel of it - that the guy is sad and broken hearted , but it 's still fun .
That 's what I love about Country music right there . ''
