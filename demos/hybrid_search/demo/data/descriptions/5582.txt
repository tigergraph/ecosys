This was the very first Foo Fighters ' song ever released .
It is one of the few songs from their debut album that the band still plays live .
In an interview with Kerrang !
magazine , Grohl cautioned listeners not to read too much into this song , explaining that he avoided writing lyrical content that people would `` read into '' because of his Nirvana past .
-LRB- thanks , Dan - redcar -RRB- Dave Grohl : `` The chorus says , ` This is a call to all my past resignations . '
It 's just sort of like a little wave to all the people I ever played music with , people I 've been friends with , all my relationships , my family .
It 's a hello , and in a way a thank you . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bert - Pueblo , NM , for above 2 -RRB-
