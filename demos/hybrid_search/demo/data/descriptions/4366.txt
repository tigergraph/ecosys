The black and white Noel Paul directed video shows Khan singing and dancing her way across a beach .
This is one of several songs on The Haunted Man that were inspired by Khan 's realization that there are certain relationship patterns , which had trickled down her family tree over several generations .
She told Khan told NME : `` I 'd been thinking a lot about relationships and how patterns trickle down the generations .
And how sometimes you 're subconsciously behaving in ways that have a lot to do with your DNA .
I went back and looked at marriages in the family to see how they had worked out , how many people had been divorced just looking back and finding these patterns of behavior . ''
