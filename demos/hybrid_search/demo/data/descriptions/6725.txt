This is the third single that was released from Fight or Flight , Hoobastank 's fifth studio album .
Fight or Flight was Hoobastank 's initial release on Open E Entertainment -LRB- EMI -RRB- following a decade on Island Records .
`` We 've been on this journey for a long time now , '' said singer Doug Robb .
`` It 's like a clean slate , but not in a bad way-quite the opposite .
We 're no longer trying to satisfy others , not even on a subconscious level ; we 're comfortable in our own skin . ''
Hoobastank travelled to Iraq in June 2011 for the USO Road Tour , performing for the US military throughout the country .
The video contains some footage from the band 's trip .
`` That was important to include , '' Estrin told Noisecreep .
`` We had an awesome time playing for the troops .
Also , originally we were going to make a slightly different video , where little facts would come up to tell people what they were seeing but then we decided enough of it looked pretty obvious people that people get a sense of what they were watching . ''
Hoobastank guitarist Dan Estrin directed the video , which acts as a behind-the-scenes documentary of the band .
`` I 'm a music history dude and I could watch documentaries all day , that 's what kind of inspired this visually , '' he explained to Noisecreep : `` Documentaries are very valuable for helping teach peace people about music and with this new video we 're teaching people a bit about our band .
Even when I was a kid I loved watching music documentaries though .
And today , reality TV shows are so popular that it 's become a given that people want to see a little bit more about your band . ''
