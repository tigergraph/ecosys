This is a track from alternative American singer-songwriter Santigold 's second album .
She explained the long player 's title to V Magazine : `` My record is called Master of My Make-Believe because I want it to be about creating your own reality .
I have a song called ` The Keepers ' : ` we 're the keepers , while we sleep in America our house is burning down ' . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Santigold along with Nabil and it sees the singer play a member of an idyllic 1950s American family in a pointed criticism of today 's society .
Watch out for cameo appearances from Wu-Tang Clan 's GZA , Robert F. Kennedy 's granddaughter Kick Kennedy and snowboarder Trevor Andrew.Santigold explained the clip 's concept to Digital Spy .
`` It 's about taking responsibility for the state of the world , '' she said , `` and how we ca n't turn a blind eye because everything is falling apart .
It 's about the need to sit up and take responsibility for it .
`` She added : `` The fish is toxic because of nuclear power , the milk has hormones and antibiotics in it because cows are n't designed to be milked that much .
There 's oil in the water because of the spillages and a drive-by shooting because there 's insane amounts of violence going on in the world .
We act like it 's all normal and are completely desensitized to it . ''
Santigold told NME that reality shows are a metaphor for the inert mental state of most of the population .
`` The song ` The Keepers ' is about that . ''
she revealed .
`` It 's about being able to sit and watch these shows and think , ` This is awful , ' but not do anything about it .
But people are starting to question things .
You can see it in the riots and the Occupy movement .
That 's the spirit of the album .
I want people to think about why they are doing what they are doing . ''
