American garage punk band Black Lips ' sixth studio album Black Arabia was written and recorded over a nine month stretch from March 2010 to January 2011 , and was released on June 7 , 2011 .
Most of the record was produced by Mark Ronson who is best known for manning the controls on Amy Winehouse 's Back to Black disc .
Drummer Joe Bradley told NME helpfully , '' ` Raw Meat ' actually has raw meat on it .
Cole -LRB- Alexander , vocals -RRB- and I brought these big slabs into the studio , and we were totally chimping out on them . ''
Ronson 's eagerness to get in the spirit of things when producing this dancefloor rocker almost cost him dearly .
Alexander told UK music magazine the NME : `` To get in the mood to record it , we started eating all this liver sashimi .
Then we all started getting sick from it .
Mark had to go to the hospital because his fever was so high .
His brain was cooking man .
`` Ronson has forgiven the band .
He told the NME : `` I was diagnosed with something with a lot of syllables in it .
I almost died .
But I do n't think it was intentional on their part . ''
