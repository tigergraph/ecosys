The first single to be released from Nelly 's seventh studio album , M.O. , was his first entry on Billboard 's Nielsen BDS-based Pop Songs since `` Just A Dream '' two-and-a-half years previously .
However some questioned the song 's Pop direction , especially its similarity to Flo Rida 's `` Whistle . ''
-LRB- Both tracks feature production from DJ Frank E -RRB- .
When host Misty J raised the matter during an interview with Nelly on radio station Power 107.5 in Columbus , Ohio , the St. Louis rapper/singer fired back citing the variety of his discography , which ranges from hardcore Rap to radio-friendly Pop tunes : `` Does ` Ride with Me ' sound like ` E.I. ?
, ' '' he said .
`` Does ` E.I. ' sound like ` Country Grammar ? '
Does ` Country Grammar ' sound like ` Hot In Herre ? '
Does ` Hot in Here ' sound like Dilemma ? '
Does ` Dilemma ' sound like ` Over and Over ? ' ''
Nelly is a big Prince fan , and he told AMP Radio 's Seena that this song was inspired by one of the Minneapolis icon 's own car-themed tunes .
`` It 's one of those things that I feel like is our version of ` Little Red Corvette , ' '' he said .
`` The way that song made you feel is kind of like what that is right here . ''
According to Pop program director Rich Davis , PD of KDWB Minneapolis , the song represents more of an evolution than a revolution in Nelly 's artistry .
The track is `` definitely more of a pop song than a rap song , with a great groove and a great hook , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` I think even early on , Nelly did a good job of straddling the line between pop and rap .
I 'm sure artists can tell by their bank accounts which hits are the most mass-appeal .
Nelly , with all his years in the biz , has certainly figured that out . ''
Asked by Digital Spy how the song came about , Nelly replied : `` It 's one of those situations where the producers had this idea for me and they played it for me and I kinda liked it .
So we got it in there and mixed it with something we thought would be dope . ''
