This is the story of a guy holding a letter from `` her '' and `` falling '' into a river , then later his mother holding a letter from `` him '' and falling into crying .
The lyrics `` Pity no one was there , no angels in the air '' are where the catch comes in - was it suicide , or was n't it ?
It could be about no one understanding what you really feel like until something bad happens or people who do n't care about you but pretend that they do .
