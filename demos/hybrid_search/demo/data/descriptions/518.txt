HIM lead singer and songwriter Ville Valo told the story of the song to Artist Direct : `` It was an acoustic ditty I worked on for a long time , '' he said .
`` It came together at the rehearsal space really quickly .
It reminds me of some of the older music we 've done like ` Soul on Fire . '
I wanted to go full-blown Kyuss with the riff .
I love that stoner stuff .
Joshua Homme is one of my idols when it comes to guitars and riffs .
We wanted the song to be dirty and grunge-y and a bit of a middle finger .
It 's a statement of intent .
It 's still pretty and has a lot of melody , but it 's dirtier . ''
