On this song , sea-shanty harmonies are underpinned by an orchestra .
Kyle Falconer -LRB- vocals/guitar -RRB- told The View Are On Fire that he and producer Owen Morris were inspired by the work of 19th century Austrian composer Gustav Mahler .
He explained : `` Me and Owen were listening to this composer , Mahler .
It 's meant to sound like death .
So we became obsessed with that in the studio , we used to listen to him all the time .
That was the inspiration for the start of that .
It 's sort of comparing Dundonians to these classic characters in Treasure Island .
Just these stereotypes , chasing the doubloon .
Everyone went to see their girlfriends and I was sitting with Owen just listening to the tracks .
We had nothing else to do so we just kept putting the album on over and over .
And then I just started writing bits down about Jim Hawkins and everything .
Owen said , ` Well give it a bash ' and he started playing this piano which brought the tune into itself .
We did 18 takes , recorded it live , picked the best one and then sent it to Olly -LSB- Kraus -RSB- for strings . ''
The chorus mingles the Treasure Island era and modern times and includes lines about bassist Kieren Webster getting his bike stolen in -LSB- Dundee estate -RSB- Kirkton .
