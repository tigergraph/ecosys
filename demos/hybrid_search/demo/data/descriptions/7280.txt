Santigold told Spin magazine about this song concerning self acceptance .
`` I watch TV and all the Real Housewives and Kardashians shows are shocking to me , '' she explained .
`` It 's upsetting .
Everyone has plastic surgery .
Everyone 's fighting and trying to win the affection of some guy .
But everyone 's a freak , you know ?
I 've never been in the mainstream with my style or choices .
So I wanted to write a song about us all being freaks . ''
