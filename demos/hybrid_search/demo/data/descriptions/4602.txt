This song follows a recurring theme that runs through the Bread and Circuses album about turning a bad feeling around .
Frontman Kyle Falconer told the NME : `` This one 's about having great times and wild nights with your mates , but then waking up with the fear .
We were living in Liverpool at the time we wrote it , and had just been at a wedding party with -LRB- Primal Scream bassist -RRB- Mani near Manchester . ''
Bread and Circuses was produced by Martin Glover , who is also known as Youth .
The record producer is a founding member and bassist of the UK band Killing Joke and also a member of The Fireman along with Paul McCartney .
Falconer told the NME about his contribution to this track : `` It was one of the first songs that Youth had a clear idea about what to add to finish it off -- he wanted the middle 8 in 3/4 timing to give an impression or the mind swirling around and going over all these thoughts . ''
