Sister Rosetta Tharpe , the inspiration for this song , was an influential guitarist and singer of the '30s and '40s who turned the Gospel genre on its head with her infusion of Blues and Jazz with traditional spiritual music .
Some of her notable hits were `` This Train , '' `` Down By the Riverside '' and `` Strange Things Happening Every Day . ''
The latter influenced the lyrics of Sam Phillips ' song , as she explained in her Songfacts interview : '' ` Up above my head , I hear music in the air , there 's strange things happening every day . '
I was using her to talk about the things that we ca n't see that happen all around us - the inspiration , the good things that happen to us all the time , and where do those things come from ?
I think through music and art is how we get to ecstatic experiences .
There are other ways , too , but I think for us the familiar ways are through music and art . ''
Although Phillips penned the song , it was recorded by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss for their Raising Sand album in 2007 , a year before Phillips ' own version was released -LRB- the Plant/Krauss collaboration also won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year -RRB- .
As Phillips tells it , she had a conversation with Plant where he told her that Sister Rosetta Tharpe once asked him - in his pre-Zeppelin days - to join her on tour .
