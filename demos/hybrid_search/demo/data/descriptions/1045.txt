Sweet Billy Pilgrim are an English alternative rock band , composed of bassist/banjo player Anthony Bishop , guitarist and songwriter Tim Elsenburg , and drummer/percussionist Alistair Hamer .
They took their name from the hero in Kurt Vonnegut 's anti-war science fiction novel , Slaughterhouse-Five .
This track is taken from their Barclaycard Mercury Music Prize nominated album , Twice Born Men .
The album title is borrowed from an organization for Vietnam veterans .
Eisenburg explained to Mojo magazine November 2009 : `` Conflict is a key metaphor for me .
When you return from a war , you 're inevitably changed , born again .
Similarly , you can claw your way back from a destructive relationship .
The last track is ` There Will It End ' - it could be apocalyptic but it 's actually about beginning again . ''
