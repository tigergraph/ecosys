The sinister opening track to New York folk/country rock band The Felice Brothers ' eighth album , Celebration , Florida , is anchored by a mob of children screaming , `` Calm down !
Calm down ! ''
James Felice explained to Billboard magazine : `` There was a birthday party going on one day in the high school 's old cafeteria , so we invited them up to the studio .
We have 15 kids singing on that song . ''
