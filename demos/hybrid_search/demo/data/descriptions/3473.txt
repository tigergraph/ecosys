This Jimmy Yeary and Marty Dodson penned song tells of a fishing trip on a quiet lake where the youthful couple are more interested in each other than the fish .
Morgan told Yahoo !
Music : `` I love how throughout the entire song , you think that the ol' boy is talking about one thing , when in fact he 's referring to the very thing you think about but in a different way !
So just absolutely love it .
They payoff on that song for me was really huge . ''
