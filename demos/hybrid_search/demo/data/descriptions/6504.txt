This is the first single from Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children , the seventh studio album by alternative metal band Mushroomhead .
Co-Vocalist Jeffrey Nothing told AntiMusic the story behind this song : '' ` Come On ' is about us , as a people and perhaps as a Nation , have had enough ... and seriously how much more do ` They ' think we can take ?
It 's about rebellion and standing up .
It 's being fed up.I came up with a verse , then -LRB- Co-vocalist -RRB- Waylon 's verse .
It all just started to vibe and feel good .
We merged them into ` Come On , do you wan na f -- with me . '
Skinny our drummer and producer said it was great and we were off .
Actually , my part was written from a serial killer 's perspective .
When you think of it , serial killers are for the most part feeling invincible and anonymous.This was one of the last songs we recorded .
We felt we had a good record going into finishing our new album Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children , so this song was icing on the cake .
In some ways it felt like ` Come On ' wrote itself , but there was some shifting around of parts . ''
