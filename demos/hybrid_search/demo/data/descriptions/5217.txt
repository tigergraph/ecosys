This song follows a pattern much like another track from the same CD - `` Teeth Like God 's Shoeshine '' .
The song begins with the insinuation of bitterness or anger .
It escalates into clear anger , then calms down and turns depressed .
After some time of depression , it quickly turns back into anger for a memorable finish .
