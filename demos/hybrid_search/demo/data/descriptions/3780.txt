This boisterous track was released for download in December 2009 , a few months ahead of English singer-songwriter Paul Weller 's tenth solo album , Wake Up The Nation .
Weller on the song 's lyrical content : `` There 's a dig at the royal family in the lyrics -- that whole invisible establishment is still in power , nothing 's changed . ''
The song features My Bloody Valentine 's Kevin Shields , who also contributed to a second Wake Up The Nation track , `` She Speaks . ''
Weller explained to Mojo : `` I felt his style of playing would suit those tracks so I called him up . ''
He added in a track by track on his website : `` He came down to the studio with a big bag of effects pedals and we took it from there . ''
Weller concluded to Q magazine : `` He added to that psychedelic thing , but in a modern way . ''
Kevin Shields told Mojo magazine May 2010 about his collaborations with Weller : `` I 'd met Paul a few times out and about through mutual friends , and he mentioned a year or two before that we should do something together .
Then he just called up and said how he was doing a new album and did I want to come down and try a few things out?He guided me on the single 7 & 3 is the Striker 's Name .
At first I tried to step back but he was saying , ` Do more chaotic stuff , be more freeform . '
I think that 's why I was there , that 's what he wanted from me on that track .
I think he 's a lot more experimental and open-minded than people think .
He just does things - like the way he made this record , it was very , very spontaneous .
There was this ` anything goes ' atmosphere and in the short time I was there , really just half a day , so much got done : bass lines got done , vocals were being done in amongst me doing my bits . ''
