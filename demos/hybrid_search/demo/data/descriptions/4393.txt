This was originally recorded by Joy Division on their 1979 debut album Unknown Pleasures .
The Killers covered it for the soundtrack to Control , the 2007 British movie about the Manchester band 's lead singer and songwriter Ian Curtis .
Frontman Brandon Flowers told the Daily Mail December 7 , 2007 about the way they decided to cover this song : `` We wanted to give the song an emotional uplift .
It actually sounds more like New Order than Joy Division . ''
In Rolling Stone magazine the director of Control , Anton Corbjin , explained why he used this song at the closing credits : `` The end scenes are very strong and very beautiful .
There 's also the reason why over the credits I put on a poppy version of ` Shadow Play ' that The Killers had made for the film , because it helps you lift the mood a bit . ''
Ian Curtis of Joy Division wrote the original lyrics , which include a reference to suicide : `` In the shadowplay acting out your own death , knowing no more . ''
Curtis hanged himself just over a year after Joy Division recorded this .
