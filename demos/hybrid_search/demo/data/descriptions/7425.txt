Vocalist Chad Gray told Artist Direct the story behind this somber acoustic dirge : `` Greg -LRB- Tribbett , guitarist -RRB- actually wrote those lyrics .
I changed some of the lyrics in the verses and in the chorus .
I wrote the bridge , but that 's actually a song he 's had for a long time .
We just decided to do it .
I 've always loved the song .
I was like , ` We should do this song .
It 's a great song . '
Finally , Greg was like , ` Yeah , let 's do it . '
He 's that kind of dude -- strong , silent .
He speaks through the guitar .
He wrote that song while we were recording Lost and Found .
He lived on this little houseboat , and I remember him telling me he wrote the song on the roof of it .
He played it for me and I loved it .
It 's really dark ; it sounds like something that I would write .
The melodies and lyrics reminded me of something that I would write .
I feel like it was cohesive to what we were doing and that we should do it .
It makes sense and fits on a Mudvayne record -- as much as that song could fit on a Mudvayne record .
It 's acoustic guitar and vocals ; it 's the first time we 've ever done it . ''
