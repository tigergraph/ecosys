Dead By Sunrise is the side project of Linkin Park 's vocalist , Chester Bennington and electronica outfit Julien-K .
This was the first single released from their debut album , Out of Ashes .
Bennington explained the band 's name and album title to MTV News : `` I came up with the band name because in the beginnings of making this album , I was partying ... we 'll call it partying .
It was n't much fun , but we partied a lot .
And there was a lot of times where I was kind of in a really self-destructive place , and sometimes it felt like you were n't sure if you were going to make it to the next day .
The name kind of evolved from that lifestyle , and the title of the record , Out of Ashes , is kind of coming out of that self-destructive path I was on , and rising from the ashes , so to speak . ''
Derakh told AntiMUSIC about filming the video : `` The video shoot was actually pretty easy .
We all shot separately on the rocks .
It 's fairly easy for us -- really cool location , and we just did our thing . ''
The song details Bennington 's slow climb back after extricating himself from a self-destructive lifestyle .
He explained to MTV News that the climb started with some serious self-discovery : `` It 's a song about questioning your authenticity .
I do that every once in a while ; I wonder how many of my own thoughts are really my own , and how much influence do the people around me have on the person I am . ''
Guitarist Amir Derakh told AntiMUSIC about this song : `` The song itself is about the purity of who you are before you 're born , and then when you get older , you want to get back to the same purity of youth . ''
