The titular Stevie is Stevie Wonder , who plays harmonica on this track .
Pixie told the Mail On Sunday 's You Magazine that the Motown legend 's contribution was a delightful surprise for her .
She recalled : `` We were recording in Los Angeles , and one of the guys said he had a friend coming over -- he would n't say who it was .
I was really overwhelmed when Stevie Wonder , my all-time favorite musician , walked through the door . ''
