This ambient number by the Swedish electronic band Little Dragon was forgotten by the quartet after they recorded it , only for them to find it again and include it as the closing track of their third album , Ritual Union .
Vocalist Yukimi Nagano discussed the song in an interview with This is Fake DIY : `` That desire that you ca n't deny lifting you couple inches above ground .
When you give in .
Flout .
Sweetness in the sky , humming insects that are in trance moving the beat , the forest and the cities .
But you are still hooked .
This song has simplicity and was easy to record .
It came with a flow on just one of those days in the studio . ''
