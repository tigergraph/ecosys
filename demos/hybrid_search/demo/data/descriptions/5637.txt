This is the title track of Christian singer-songwriter Matthew West 's first Christmas album , which is a mixture of original songs and classic Christmas favorites .
After his video for `` One Last Christmas '' became a hit on YouTube , a film producer contacted West .
He wanted to make a movie inspired by the song 's true story of 2-year-old Dax Locke , who when he was dying of leukemia was given a special last Christmas by his local community .
The producer asked West to read the script and write a new song that would potentially serve as the title of the movie .
The singer-songwriter explained to The Boot : `` Instead of it being a specific story song like ` One Last Christmas , ' it needed to be a song that captured the whole essence of the film and the other stories that were going to go along with the script .
After reading the script and realizing that one of the main characters is this mom who has a couple kids , is working two jobs and trying to make time for everything , when she 's really missing the heart of Christmas , that 's how I came up with the song idea . ''
The movie people liked it and decided to call the movie ` The Heart of Christmas ' as well .
West has a small part in The Heart Of Christmas playing a friendly neighbor who together with his wife comes up with the idea of putting up Christmas decorations round the local community in honor of the little boy .
