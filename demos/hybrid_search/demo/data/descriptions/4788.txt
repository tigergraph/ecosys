The video for this six-minute , Caribbean-influenced tune was directed by Roxy Farhat & Kakan Hermansson , and shows an all-male dance class led by a young woman .
According to The Knife , the clip looks to deconstruct `` images of maleness , power and leadership '' via dance .
The Swedish Dance-Pop duo explained in a statement : `` Who are the people we trust as our leaders and why ?
What do we have to learn from those we consider inferior ?
In a sport setting where one would traditionally consider a group of men as powerful and in charge , an unexpected leader emerges .
A child enters and allows the men to let go of their hierarchies , machismo and fear of intimacy , as they follow her into a dance .
Their lack of expertise and vulnerability shines through as they perform the choreography .
Amateurs and skilled dancers alike express joy and a sense of freedom ?
There is no prestige in their performance .
The child is powerful , tough and sweet all at once , roaring ` I 'm telling you stories , trust me . '
There is no shame in her girliness , rather she possesses knowledge that the men lost a long time ago . ''
The song title is a play on Jesus Christ 's teachings about retaliation when he said during his Semon on the Mount , `` You have heard that it was said , ` Eye for eye , and tooth for tooth . '
But I tell you , Do not resist an evil person .
If someone strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him the other also . ''
-LRB- Matthew 5 v 38-39 -RRB- `` An eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth '' was originally part of The Old Testament law in which damages in criminal cases were limited to no more than the loss suffered .
However the Jews in Christ 's day were justifying personal vengeance -LRB- in other words taking the law into their own hands -RRB- by appealing to the same texts .
Jesus ' instructions on morality challenged this interpretation of the Old Testament law .
