This Ray Stephenson and Buddy Owens penned break-up lament finds Blake Shelton pairing up with his wife and fellow Country singer Miranda Lambert .
However , despite the interest in the duet between the newly wedded couple , Shelton admitted it was unlikely to get radio airplay due to the red tape involved when a song features artists from different labels - Shelton is with Warner Music Nashville , while Lambert is signed to Sony Music Nashville .
`` That 's one of the things that drive me and Miranda crazy about Nashville , '' said Shelton , `` the fact that it 's so hard to collaborate with people .
Look at other genres , and that 's almost all they do !
It seems like they know what they 're doing , as far as selling a lot of music .
So it 's frustrating.It 's a thousand wonders that it worked out with ` Hillbilly Bone , ' because looking back , Trace -LSB- Adkins -RSB- probably knew he was leaving his label and then everything worked out where it could be a single , '' he continued .
`` Otherwise , that probably would have never happened , and I ca n't imagine where my career would be without that song . ''
Shelton earned his very first platinum album when Red River Blue was certified in early 2013 by the Recording Industry Association of America -LRB- RIAA -RRB- for sales in excess of one million copies .
