Psychostick brings comedy and Metal together , resulting in some unusual songs .
Their guitarist Josh Key told us about this track from their first album : '' ` Throwin ' Down ' was about an ex-girlfriend of our lead singer Rob Kersey 's that was your typical , bossy-bitchy girlfriend .
She had some serious control issues and made our lives a living hell .
There was some genuine anger in the studio when Rob tracked vocals for it .
I was actually a little scared being in the same room with him because he turned into such a beast . ''
