This is a track from British soul and R&B singer Beverley Knight 's sixth studio album , 100 % .
Knight explained on her website : `` This is a song I wrote from the sad memory of a previous relationship .
Sometimes as a relationship reaches its end , you can become strangers , not even speaking .
As though made of stone .
Although it has a sad lyric , the feel of the track is very upbeat , especially when it hits the chorus !
There is a recurring guitar signature throughout which is very sing-a-long , in fact I join in with it at the final chorus . ''
Knight co-wrote this song with Jimmy Hogarth -LRB- Adele , Duffy -RRB- .
