This is the second single from American R&B singer Jeremih 's sophomore album , All About You .
The song features rapper 50 Cent and was produced by Drumma Boy .
The song received a boost when 50 Cent lampooned the track during an appearance with YouTube star Keenan Cahill on Chelsea Hander 's late-night show .
The song was Jeremih 's first Top Ten hit since his debut single , Birthday Sex .
50 made the claim to Angie Martinez that the song 's success spared the R&B singer from getting axed from his record label .
`` They was counting Jeremih out completely .
He was already gon ' be dropped from Def Jam before -LSB- ` Down on Me ' -RSB- , '' 50 revealed .
`` He was definitely gon na be in a position where he was getting dropped because the first week sales was really low on the record . ''
Director Colin Tilley shot the song 's music video in Los Angeles on November 17 , 2010 .
Jeremih told MTV News he wanted the clip to match the song 's sultry feel .
`` The song itself is definitely for the clubs .
We wanted to keep it real sexy for the ladies , '' he said .
`` As an artist , there 's nothing like hearing your record in the club .
The visual , we wanted to make sure when you see the video in the club , it portrays that message .
So we got a lot of sexy ladies , kept it classy .
It 's going down .
`` 50 Cent reiterated Jeremih 's claims .
`` It 's a pleasure to hear great music after you finished in the studio , '' he explained .
`` Then you use your imagination and wonder how people are gon na embrace it .
Me , I got a different approach .
I 'll be like , ` Ah , man , when n -- as hear this , they gon na be sick .
I 'm back , baby ! ' ''
50 told Hot 97 's Angie Martinez there was no deep reason why he chose this collaboration - he just likes Jeremih .
`` We did the song , I did n't care , '' Fif said .
`` I was just looking at him as an artist and I said he sounds good , and I thought he was a dope artist , so I said I ` mma do it and we did the song , and then it took off.It made sense to me from an artist 's perspective , '' he continued .
`` What I have now , the luxury of being in a secure space financially , is me having the ability to make decisions based on just the art . ''
