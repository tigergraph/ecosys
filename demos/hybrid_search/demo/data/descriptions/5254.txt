Angaleena Presley was in the middle of a divorce , living in the ghetto , sleeping next to her three-year-old son when she was invited to join the Pistol Annies .
She recalled : `` One night , at like 2 a.m. , I got a call from my friend , Ashley Monroe , and Miranda Lambert .
They had been listening to my record -- and probably drinking a lot -- and asked me if I wanted to start a band with them .
I almost hung up 'cause I thought it was a prank call , but I went ahead and told them ` yes , ' and I 'm glad I did . ''
This song was inspired by Angaleena leaving her former husband and the effect on her infant son .
She told Billboard magazine : `` Every word of it is true .
My husband was awful , and it was such an awful situation .
But to leave that situation , I had to break my baby 's heart , and that broke my heart even worse than my husband broke my heart .
I can see why people stay in bad marriages , because I ca n't stand to see him goin ' through that . ''
