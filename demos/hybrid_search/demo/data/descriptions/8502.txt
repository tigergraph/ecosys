`` Bubbly '' is n't about anybody specific , Caillat explained to ilikemusic.com : `` It 's about the feelings you get when you have a crush on someone and they make you make smile all the time ; they give you butterflies and you just adore everything they do . ''
The young singer-songwriter added that the inspiration for the song came in the summer of 2006 when she was realizing that , `` I did n't have a crush on anyone , and its always fun to have a crush .
So I was just thinking about missing those feelings and wanting them . ''
Caillat wrote this song with Jason Reeves , who came to Los Angeles from Iowa and met Colbie his first day in the city .
They ended up moving in together -LRB- Reeves says she 's `` like a sister '' -RRB- , and working on songs for her first album .
When we spoke with Reeves in 2011 , he told us , `` The thing about Colbie and I writing is that it 's so easy and natural .
I really do n't know how to describe it beyond that .
But I think we 're just so comfortable with each other and we 're so free with what we 're feeling at the moment when we 're writing a song that there 's not very many walls between us to get in the way . ''
In 2012 , Caillat told us that this was the easiest song she ever wrote .
`` I seriously wrote it in 20 minutes .
It 's one of those songs that just came out naturally , '' she said .
