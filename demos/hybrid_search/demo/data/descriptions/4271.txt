Keith penned this song about an old timer giving guidance to younger folk with his frequent collaborator , Nashville singer-songwriter Bobby Pinson .
It was inspired by something that Pinson said .
Keith explained : `` That 's exactly how Bobby talks .
We were at dinner one night and he dropped his fork on the floor .
When he bent down to pick it up he had plumber 's crack .
Everybody at the table saw and his wife started laughing .
She makes as much fun of him as anybody .
He knew what everybody was laughing about and said , ` Sorry , everybody .
My jeans quit being jeans before my ass quit being an ass .
` Everything he says is that funky , '' he continued `` So when he came out with , ` Sometimes you get it and sometimes you get got , ' we just started in on the idea .
We tried to come up with as many pieces of advice as an old man can give you .
It 's a well-crafted song and everything you kind of expect to achieve when you start out with a great idea like that . ''
