Written by Johnny Ramone , this song is an instrumental that was inspired by a passage in the book A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess .
The characters steal a sports car , which the character Alex calls a `` Durango 95 . ''
The car was made up for the book , but in the movie it was portrayed by a Probe 16 .
The reckless youth go for a joy ride , running other drivers off the road along the way , and then drive it into a body of water and watch it sink .
This song is supposed to go along with the characters ' joy ride .
