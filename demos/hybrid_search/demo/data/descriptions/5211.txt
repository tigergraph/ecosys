This piano-ballad is an unabashed love song penned by frontman Dave Longstreth about his relationship with bandmate Amber Coffman .
`` I need you and you 're always on my mind , '' he sings of his long term collaborator and partner .
Longstreth told Tonedeaf.com : `` It 's a very personal song , and it 's up to everybody to get in there with it on a personal level .
Whatever you 'd say about it would probably be true anyway .
All I can say is , this is the most personal song on the record .
And it 's really true to life ! ''
