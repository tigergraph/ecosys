Like the previous 2nd Law track `` Save Me , '' Muse bassist Chris Wolstenholme wrote this about his alcohol addiction .
He told NME : `` Liquid State was written about the person you become when you 're intoxicated and how the two of them are having this fight inside of you and it tears you apart . ''
Taking the lead and playing his songs to the band was a step up for Wolstenholme .
He told The Sun : `` After five albums of one songwriter , suddenly the roles changed for those songs .
It was hard having to take the lead a little more . ''
