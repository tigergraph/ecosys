The second single of John Mayer 's fifth studio album Born and Raised finds him harking back to the Laurel Canyon days of the early '70s , when the bohemian spirit of the LA neighborhood was an influence on so many LA rock musicians .
`` Looking for the sun that Neil Young hung .
After the gold rush of 1971 , '' he sings .
Mayer told NPR the song concerns , `` being able to have a hopeful vibe about something again ... it 's actually about getting over stuff . ''
