This was the first single released by the Tacoma , Washington singer-songwriter Vicci Martinez , who signed with Republic Records after coming joint third on NBC 's singing competition series The Voice in 2011 .
Martinez recorded the song in Germany and then at the last minute had the idea to have her Voice coach Cee Lo Green as part of the record .
`` I went to The Voice where they were filming and I put some headphones on his head while he was eating chicken wings because that was the only way I could have him sit down and pay attention , '' she told Radio.com .
`` He really liked it so we got him to come in and do a verse . ''
The song is a cover of a 2001 single from Swedish recording act Titiyo , which was a Top 20 hit throughout Central Europe but was not released in the USA or UK .
It was penned by former Cardigans guitarist Peter Svensson with whom Martinez wrote several tracks for her Vicci album .
The Tacoma songstress told Radio.com that he was persuaded by one of his friends to play the tune to her .
`` He played it for me and I went over and punched him on the arm and I was like , ` Why did n't you play that for me ?
That 's totally my style , everything about it , love the words , ' '' she recalled .
`` So then I asked if I could redo it .
It did n't really break in the US and we went for it . ''
Martinez explained to Radio.com that the chalk scene in the video is supposed to represent the unity between all the people in the clip .
`` In the end we have a chalk fight , and it 's showing that we 're all in this together , '' she said .
`` Male , female , whatever shape or size , gay , straight - we 're all in this together . ''
