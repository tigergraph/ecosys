After writing and performing music for his films , cult movie director David Lynch finally released his debut album , Crazy Clown Time , at the age of 65 .
According to Lynch , most of the songs on the album originated from jamming sessions .
He told Billboard magazine : '' I -LSB- would -RSB- say probably a 20 to 25-minute jam is 97 % garbage .
Maybe in that three percent there is something there and that becomes the fuel for the next steps , which lead to the finished song .
`` Lynch added that this song was an example of this process : `` That track came out of a jam when my guitar was just making a sound that was thrilling to me .
It started making the sound of a speed roadster ... a night time dream that was sparkling in the piney woods . ''
