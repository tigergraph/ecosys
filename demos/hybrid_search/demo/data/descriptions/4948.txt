Singer and lyricist Hayley Williams told Alternative Press about this track : `` Josh -LSB- Farro , guitar -RSB- and I wrote this a week before we left the studio .
It 's the first song we ever wrote together from start to finish .
He had this guitar line that really reminded me of some old -LSB- 1990s emo band -RSB- Get Up Kids song or something .
It did n't really sound like anything else we 'd written before .
It 's a simple song .
It feels good .
And that 's pretty much all there is to it . ''
