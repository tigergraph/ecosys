This song is about Neil Young 's close relationship with his guitar .
Young has an old guitar which was once used by Hank Williams , who was a big influence on Neil .
In Young 's 2006 movie Heart Of Gold , in Nashville Tennessee he talks about how the guitar finally returns to the spot where Hank Williams once played it .
Young 's friend found the guitar some 30 years ago and Neil has had it since .
