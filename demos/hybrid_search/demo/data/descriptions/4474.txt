Speaking with Kerrang !
magazine , drummer/vocalist Brann Dailor explained : `` The title is about having to take on a lot of work yourself .
It came from a period when we were writing , it felt like I was the only person going down to the studio .
It 's a song about things not going as smoothly as they might . ''
Guitarist Bill Kelliher told the story of the song to MusicRadar.com : `` Brann and I threw that one around .
He hums a lot of stuff , and I 'll figure it out on guitar .
I tuned down to A , which gets a really great sound .
During the chorus , once I heard the vocals , I could tell the song was going to be amazing , so I put in some really evil harmony guitars .
Actually , that 's another song I worked on away from the studio .
I recorded some stuff on my laptop backstage in Berlin .
You got ta jump when the time is right , you know ? ''
Musically , the song is a tribute of sorts to one of Mastodon 's favorite metal bands .
Said Brent Hinds -LRB- vocals/guitar -RRB- to Spin : `` It kind of sounds like Neurosis , with that evil , minor , creepy sounding stuff . ''
Scott Kelly of Neurosis is a good friend of the band and has made guest appearances on several Mastodon tracks including `` Crack The Skye '' and `` Spectrelight . ''
