The basic summary is that Dylan is longing for some girl who has left him , like Suze Rotolo .
However , this would be impossible seeing that they 've been broken up for about 15 years .
Not to mention he 's been married probably twice .
The song is more likely just some general scenario that Dylan put along with a catchy tune .
