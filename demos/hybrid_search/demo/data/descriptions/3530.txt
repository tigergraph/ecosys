Despite its arrogant title , this song finds West coming to realize his place within the grand scheme of things .
The cut is based on Psalm 82 vs 6-7 in the Bible : `` I said , ` You are ` gods , ' you are all sons of the Most High .
But you shall die like mere men ; You will fall like every other ruler . ''
The Psalmist is addressing the rulers of Israel , calling them ` gods ' because they represented God in executing judgment .
Some theologians believe there is a parallel meaning also alluding the promise to the righteous that they will be transformed to a spirit existence after death and become children of God .
They maintain that Jesus , himself used these verses to defend his claims to be God -LRB- John 10 34-36 -RRB- .
-LRB- Christ argued that if God would call mere men ` gods ' , why was it blasphemous for him , the true Son of God , to declare himself equal with God ? -RRB-
Rick Rubin -LRB- Johnny Cash , Red Hot Chili Peppers , Beastie Boys -RRB- served as the executive producer of Yeezus .
The pair worked on minimalizing some of the album 's excesses , rerecording vocals and sometimes writing entire new verses .
Prior to the record 's release , West updated his official website to feature a short video clip of him recording this song while Rubin lays back on a chair and responds to Yeezy 's query as to whether he should be stacking ` billions ' or ` millions . '
The fuzzy-bearded producing legend responds `` millions '' , adding , `` To me it 's more relatable .
More for the people .
`` West told guests at the album 's playback : `` It was good for me to go to the god , Rick Rubin , and play him my s -- t , ask him questions , and allow him to take this project to an entirely new level , and he made a lot of great decisions at the end and pulled it to a whole new level . ''
That 's the voice of Bon Iver 's Justin Vernon you can hear at the tail end of this song .
The iTunes listing for Yeezus shows this as `` featuring God '' in an apparent effort to add to the controversy of the song title .
Ultimately , West employs a sound effect in the apparent role of the Almighty .
The album itself has a controversial , potentially blasphemous title being a combination of Kanye and Jesus -LRB- albeit with a ` z ' rather than a 's . ' -RRB-
West clarified during a playback of the record his reasons for naming it ` Yeezus ' .
`` I want to explain something about the album title , '' he said .
`` Simply put , ` West ' was my slave name and ` Yeezus ' is my God name . ''
The song samples Capleton 's Dancehall tune `` Forward Inna Dem Clothes '' and Manna Dey and Asha Bhosle 's cut `` Are Zindagi Hai Khel , '' from the 1972 Bollywood movie , Seeta aur Geeta .
West revealed during an interview for W magazine that he penned the song in response to a diss from an unnamed fashion designer .
Kanye explained that the designer invited him to his runway show during Paris Fashion Week on one condition -- that he would decline other fashion shows that season .
`` So the next day I went to the studio with Daft Punk , '' West said . ''
'Cause it 's like , Yo !
Nobody can tell me where I can and ca n't go .
Man , I 'm the # 1 living and breathing rock star .
I am Axl Rose ; I am Jim Morrison ; I am Jimi Hendrix ... To even think they could tell me where I could and could n't go is just ludicrous .
It 's blasphemous - to rock 'n' roll , and to music . ''
