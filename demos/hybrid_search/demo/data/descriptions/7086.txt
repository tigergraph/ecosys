There is an amusing story behind this song which is related in Jerry Bloom 's biography of Ritchie Blackmore .
A French fan named Muriel had been following the guitarist around Europe for some considerable time , and `` One day I looked out of my window and thought I saw the bushes move in the garden .
I kept watching and sure enough she 'd found my house , so I set my dogs on her !
`` The same anecdote is related in the September 1997 issue of the Blackmore fanzine More Black Than Purple , wherein the reader is assured that the lady in question did not meet an unfortunate end .
Blackmore said of his dogs : `` They 're not violent , but they started licking her face , and she ran off . ''
`` Starstruck '' is an uptempo number running to 4 minutes 6 seconds , and was co-written by Blackmore and lead vocalist Ronnie James Dio .
It was released as a single backed by `` Stargazer . ''
