DJ Premier provided the beat for this homage to his late Gang Star partner Guru .
Joe told MTV News that he got the track from Preemo the same day Guru passed away in April 2010 : `` I was waiting for Preemo to give me a ` Ten Crack Commandments ' or a shoot 'em up , bang bang , '' he explained , recalling his expectations when he got the track for this song .
`` He sent me the beat when Guru died - the day Guru died .
It was a somber , sad beat .
I was like , ` Ah , man . '
I knew where to go with it .
It really troubled me and I knew Guru passed away .
I knew Preemo was hurting ; I been through that with Pun .
I knew how it felt .
I had to pay homage and salute . ''
At a concert at SOB 's in New York City , Joe explained he recorded the song as he was sickened and saddened by reading rumors about Guru on the Internet when his friend passed away .
