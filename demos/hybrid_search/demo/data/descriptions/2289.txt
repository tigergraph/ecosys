The Hazards of Love is a concept album concerning the trials and tribulations of a woman named Margaret , her foppish lover , William , who provides the dramatic undoing of the tragic heroine , the queen of a spooky forest and a murdering knave .
Decemberists ' frontman Colin Meloy originally intended it to be an actual musical , staged by director Michael Mayer -LRB- Spring Awakening -RRB- .
In an interview with Paste magazine , Meloy revealed that he , `` decided about halfway through my time in France that it was n't going to work as a stage piece .
But it would still work as a Rock record , so that 's where it ended up . ''
This is the first of 4 `` Hazards Of Love '' songs on the album .
The original inspiration for The Hazards of Love was a 1966 EP of the same title by English folk singer Anne Briggs .
Meloy explained to about.com : `` Her first 45 was ` The Hazards of Love , ' four traditional songs , all unaccompanied voice , but none actually called ` The Hazards of Love . '
A title which , I then figured , was fair game .
It seemed , to me , to illustrate the themes of much of the music arranged in the folk-revival of the '60s , and the younger generation 's attraction to romantic songs tinged with darkness and violence .
`` Meloy added in an interview with The Sun April 3 , 2009 : `` I 'd been immersing myself in music from that period , from the Sixties and Seventies , particularly the British folk revival and Anne has a phenomenal biography .
It had enough for someone to romanticise .
I just fell in love with her music , her voice , her approach to arrangements and the music that she picked . ''
Meloy told about.com that this was the first song he wrote for the album , `` in which I stole the genesis motif of innumerable folk-songs : a woman going out into the wild to pull flowers , and , thus , the adventure begins .
By the time I got to the end of the song , the story felt like it was only just beginning . ''
