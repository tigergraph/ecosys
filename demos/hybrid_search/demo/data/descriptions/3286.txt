This bonus track was originally recorded by former Aqua vocalist Lene on her 2003 solo album Play With Me .
Lene previously wrote `` No Good Advice '' and `` You Freak Me Out '' for Girls Aloud 's debut album Sound of the Underground .
The album title Out of Control comes from a lyric in this song .
It was the quintet 's record company , who picked it out .
Girl Aloud Kimberley Walsh explained to the BBC : `` They said : ` We do n't know what to say , you lot are out of control .
We ca n't tell you anything . '
So that 's where that came from .
` Out of control ' means you ca n't tell us what to do . ''
