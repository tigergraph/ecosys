Flogging Molly is a seven piece Irish-American Celtic punk group comprising Dave King -LRB- lead vocals -RRB- , Bridget Regan -LRB- fiddle , tin whistle , uillean pipes -RRB- , Dennis Casey -LRB- guitar -RRB- , Matt Hensley -LRB- accordion , concertina -RRB- , Nathen Maxwell -LRB- bass guitar -RRB- Bob Schmidt -LRB- mandolin , banjo -RRB- and George Schmidt -LRB- drums -RRB- .
King explained to Alternative Press magazine how the band contributed to the writing of this song : `` We did n't -LSB- originally -RSB- have an intro for the song .
We were just going to go `` one-two-three-four '' and -LSB- kick into the riff -RSB- .
Then Nate started playing around with this bass line .
He 's a big hardcore fan .
And sure enough , he played the riff , and that was it.As a band , it 's a really democratic thing .
I think Bridget came up with the riff .
But she wrote it like a ballad .
And I heard it and grabbed a hold of it and sat down with my guitar and came up with the main body of the song .
We all sit around and give our opinion for every song . ''
