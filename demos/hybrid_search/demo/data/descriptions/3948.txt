A theme that runs through Californian singer-songwriter Colbie Caillat 's third studio album , All Of You , is the ups and downs of relationships .
The singer 's experience of falling in love with her guitarist and musical director Justin Young is the inspiration behind the subject matter .
She told PopEater this song is about , `` when I was upset and frustrated and wanting more honesty and more openness . ''
PopEater asked Caillat what Young thinks about their relationship being written in song ?
She replied : `` He loves them .
When I 'd write the songs after we 'd be in a fight or I 'd be upset , I 'd go record it and come home and play it to him .
I would be nervous because I 'd feel bad that I was venting about us and it 's personal and it 's going to be out there for people to hear and the other songwriter knows about it .
But he is such a supportive man .
He is so great , and he loves the songs and was very encouraging and proud of me for being able to write what I did and vent about it and get it out in a positive way .
It made me feel better , where other people can understand what they 're going through . ''
