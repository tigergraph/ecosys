Vocalist Ben Bridwell told The Skinny the story of this bar room rocker : `` I had the music down for this as a demo but I could n't figure out what to sing on it basically and I think I just went to mine the territory of living in Seattle and some of the situations that revolved around that time .
To me it 's comedic but I do n't know if anyone will ever get what the f -- k I 'm talking about ` cos it 's done in my usual way of masking the actual content of what 's really going on . ''
One of the inspirations for this song was an eerie experience Bridwell had years previously , on his first day of a writing stay at the resort town of Moclips in Washington , USA .
He told UK newspaper The Independent how the window of the mobile home next door haunted him .
`` I thought ` ah , somebody 's in there ' , '' he recalled .
`` And they never left .
I never saw it move again .
I never saw anybody , there was nobody on the beach walking around .
Of course the imagination starts working .
So I 'm sitting there trying to record something , and I keep hearing this ` ding , ding , ding ' and ... what is that noise ?
Now I 'm convinced that someone is trapped in an underground basement .
Because they have n't heard a car go by on this dirt road for so long , they 're trying desperately to get my attention .
The sun 's going down , I 'm going to explore this weird-ass mile of dirt road .
And when I come back , it 's this flagpole , right outside my place , going ` ding , ding ' in the wind .
It 's those little things , those tinges of paranoia where your mind starts telling yourself ... terrible things !
There 's no one around that you can have comfort in .
It 's up to me to save this Silence of the Lambs situation .
`` Years later , Bridwell recalled the experience in this song 's line , `` somebody trapped in an underground basement just down the road . ''
