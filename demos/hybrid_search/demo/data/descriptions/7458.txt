Chan ` Cat Power ' Marshall draws parallels with the moon and 9/11 on this delicate piano ballad : `` Do n't look at the moon tonight .

She explained to UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph : `` I lived in the East Village at the time , so I saw all these people go by with their briefcases and suits , covered in ash , still acting civilized .
