Posting on her Facebook wall , Lady Gaga explained : `` I wrote ` Hair ' about how my parents used to get pissed at my outfits and my hair when I was a kid .
`` She elaborated in her 2011 Thanksgiving special : `` This song is about your identity being the most important thing to you ... it 's what 's on the inside that matters .
I used to get made fun of because my mom used to get up and do her hair every day in the morning , and I really looked up to my mother , so would sometimes be up blowdrying my hair until one in the morning .
I 'd come to school , and my friends would say , ` Why is your hair so nice ?
It 's all girls in this school , you do n't have to look so nice for class . '
Well , I want to be like my mom .
Now , my hair means so much to me - I must have hundreds of wigs . ''
The song features Clarence Clemons of Bruce Springsteen 's E Street Band on saxophone .
He also plays on Born this Way 's third single `` The Edge Of Glory . ''
Gaga explained to Ryan Seacrest on his radio show : `` It 's really up-tempo .
It 's a club record , but has a Bruce Springsteen vibe .
It 's really interesting because it 's putting sax on a huge dance record . ''
This inspirational song finds Gaga teaming up with her frequent collaborator RedOne .
The Mother Monster sings about embracing one 's hairstyle as an expression of her identity , and climaxes with her declaring `` I am my hair ! ''
Gaga said at a press listening a few months before the song 's release , that it draws inspiration from Pat Benatar 's 1984 hit `` We Belong , '' while focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of `` Born This Way . ''
