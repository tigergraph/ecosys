This album closer was written by Jon Bon Jovi , Desmond Child and Billy Falcon .
Meat Loaf admitted at a London listening party : `` Jon does n't know this yet , but I changed his lyrics to make them fit the concept .
I do n't know what Jon 'll say about that but I 've known him since 1980 , so he 'll probably be okay with it . ''
