off Jay-Z 's The Black Album .
The song samples `` Ego Trippin '' by hip-hop collective Ultramagnetic MCs from their 1988 album Critical Breakdown .
Amerie explained in publicity materials that this song , `` is about being in a relationship and hating that you 're so attached to this person . ''
She added : `` A lot of the songs on this album deal with wanting to be done with a relationship but you 're just not really ready to leave , so you hang around and wait for a person to change .
I really wanted the lyrical content to be real conversation .
I did n't want anything to be sugar-coated . ''
