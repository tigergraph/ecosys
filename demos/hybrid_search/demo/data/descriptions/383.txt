This a song about having a form of schizophrenia .
He hears voices and dresses in his mothers clothes - everyone thinks he 's `` Mental '' but he is explaining that it 's because of his confusion with the world : `` The only truth is that everything is a lie . ''
It sounds like he suffered from abuse as a child : `` They say I 'm mental but I 'm just confused , they say I 'm mental but I 've been abused . ''
