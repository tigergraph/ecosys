Vocalist and songwriter Brian Fallon told NME this is , `` somewhere between ` I 'm Waiting For The Man ' by The Velvet Underground and ` Single Ladies ' by Beyonc√© . ''
He added : `` I 'm totally serious .
Those two songs somehow mashed up in my brain .
It 's the first time I 've written from a girl 's point of view , and it 's basically Lou Reed meets , ` If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it . ' ''
Canadian actress Elisha Cuthbert stars in the Kevin Slack-directed music video .

Cuthbert previously appeared in the visual for Weezer 's 2005 single `` Perfect Situation '' where she played the lead singer of fictional group Weeze .
She is best known for her roles as Kim Bauer in the American action-thriller television series 24 and Alex Kerkovich in the ABC ensemble comedy series Happy Endings .
