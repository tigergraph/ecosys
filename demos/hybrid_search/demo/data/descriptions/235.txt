This was the first song written by Palma Violets .
It 's about a party the band attended where they drank too many mini Martells and bassist Chilli Jenson vomited everywhere , after which they returned home on the number fourteen night bus , which runs from Warren Street Station to Putney Heath .
Chilli recalled to NME : `` The next day I 'm sat at this keyboard , and I check my voicemails and there 's one from the night before , which was us doing the chorus to ' 14 . '
F -- k knows how , because none of us could remember a thing about it , but that was the first song we wrote together .
At that moment it was still a dream , really , but suddenly we had this song , and we had a reason for existing . ''
