Currington told AOL about this song written by Brett and Jim Beavers : `` I remember when I heard this one .
From the first listen it was a keeper for me .
It just had that feel of a summertime song , and I just kinda saw a video in my head , of people on the beach .
It also reminded me of when I was growing up , of how we would be when we went to the beach .
We 'd stay all weekend ... all the lyrics in the song reminded me of me and my buddies waking up , not really knowing where we were , and the solar powers of the sun got us going again .
I miss the beach . ''
