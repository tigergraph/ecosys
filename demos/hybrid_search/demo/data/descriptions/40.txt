Band member Gary Kemp started writing this song as a spoof of James Bond theme songs , specifically Goldfinger .
The band was made up of Tony Hadley -LRB- vocals -RRB- , Gary Kemp -LRB- guitar -RRB- , his brother Martin Kemp -LRB- bass -RRB- , Steve Norman -LRB- guitar -RRB- , and John Keeble -LRB- drums -RRB- .
Both Kemp brothers appeared in the film The Krays in 1990 .
Martin Kemp later acted in the BBC soap opera East Enders as Steve Owen.In 1998 Hadley , Norman and Keeble sued Gary Kemp , the chief songwriter , for a greater share of the royalties , but lost the case .
Gary Kemp recalled the writing of this song to The Mail on Sunday March 13 , 2011 : `` I used to get my brother Martin to come in when I was writing songs to give an opinion , muck about on his bass to see if I was going in the right direction .
He loved ` Gold ' from the start so I knew that I was on to something.There 's no formula to writing a song like that , but the title is key , there 's no point writing a great melody and not knowing what the title is .
It 's so hard to put the title over a melody you 've found -- it 's better to think : I have a great title , a great opening line , how do I make that into a song ? ''
The BBC used this song in their coverage of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles .
