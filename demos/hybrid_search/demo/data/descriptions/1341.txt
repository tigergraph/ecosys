This is based on `` Louis Collins , '' a song by influential Country-Blues singer and guitarist , Mississippi John Hurt , which was one of the first tunes that Rittter learnt to play .
Ritter explained to Express Night Out : '' ` Folk Bloodbath ' is a song about a bunch of characters from other folk songs : Stackalee , Delia and Louis Collins .
They all get together and everybody dies .
I think it 's a very American song . ''
