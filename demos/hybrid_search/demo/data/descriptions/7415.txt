This emotional song finds Drake describing an on-off poisonous relationship with a girl .
Despite the fact that she is constantly running around the city partying and communication is a problem , he keeps finding ways to justify staying with her .
`` That one hits you in the heart , '' Drake told Rolling Stone .
`` It 's painful and beautiful at the same time . ''
Scottish producer Hudson Mohawke supplied the beat .
He also helped create the soundscapes on a couple of Kanye West 's Yeezus tracks , `` I Am a God '' and `` Blood On The Leaves . ''
In addition , Mohawke released a self-titled EP as one half of the duo TNGHT with Canadian producer Lunice .
The pair lent one of its beats to Lil Wayne for the I Am Not a Human Being Part II track , `` Lay It Down . ''
Speaking to Vibe Magazine , Drake was asked how he came up with such lines as : `` Wish you would learn to love people and use things and not the other way around . ''
He replied : `` I just have a folder of lines .
It 's usually from conversations .
I 'll open up and see the last thing that I wrote down .
-LSB- Scrolls phone -RSB- Like this 'll probably never get used : ` I 'm not gullible , I just trust you . '
Someone must have said that to me .
I kinda just write down these lines . ''
`` Who helped me write on ` Connect ' is this girl Kenza , '' Drake added .
`` She 's a great girl and a phenomenal poetry writer .
We just sit together and come up with the best way to say things .
Actually , me and her did -LSB- the lyric -RSB- ` love people and use things and not the other way around . '
It 's cool to get another creative mind in there , just someone who 's thinking solely about the words and not the melodies and placement .
It 's nice to read her poetry sometimes , I 'll take from that . ''
Drake used to drive around in his uncle 's drop top Lexus before he was signed .
He refers to this in the lyric , `` My uncle say , ` You drive my whip like it 's yours . ' ''
The Toronto rapper also discussed this memory on `` Started from the Bottom '' when he rapped : `` And my uncle calling me like ` Where ya at ?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back . ''
The Toronto poet Kenza Samir helped Drake write this song .
She recalled : `` When I texted him , ` Is n't it amazing , how you talk all that s -- and still we lack communication , ' he was like , ` Are you talking to me about me right now or is that for the song ? ' ''
