This song was penned by Johnny Kongos .
Dylan explained to Artist Direct : `` It came about from him listening to a lot of that Kwaito music .
The variations of style that the song went through were quite vast , but it always kept this Kwaito vibe .
Johnny picked up the accordion on our first album , and it 's going to be a centerpiece of the band forever . ''
