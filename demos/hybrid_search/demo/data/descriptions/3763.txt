In 2002 Will Young won the first ever UK Pop Idol contest with Gareth Gates the runner-up .
In 2007 Gates had a # 14 in the UK with a song called `` Changes . ''
A year later Young showed he still had the upper-hand when his song of the same title did better , reaching the UK Top 10 -LRB- no changes there ! -RRB-
Will Young said on his record label 's website : `` Eg really brings the best out of me .
Writing with him is like having a very frank conversation , straight to the heart .
This is one of my most personal songs .
I was in a bit of a rut and I did n't even know it .
Writing about the changes I needed to make actually helped me get out a situation where I felt trapped by my own actions .
That really is songwriting as therapy ! ''
This was written by Young , together with his frequent collaborator Eg White .
Among White 's other songwriting credits are Will Young 's Ivor Novello Award winning `` Leave Right Now '' and James Morrison 's UK Top 10 hit , `` You Give Me Something . ''
