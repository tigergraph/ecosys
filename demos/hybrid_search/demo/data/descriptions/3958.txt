The Spinners The Rubberband Man used the office supply as a bass , and Soulja Boy used them as jewelry , but T.I. wore rubber bands around his wrists to signify how much money he anticipated making - the more rubber bands , the bigger his predicted haul .
He was always very organized , and back in his days as a hustler , he would use the rubber bands to wrap his loose bills in neat stacks , usually $ 1,000 per stack .
As his career took off , the rubber bands became symbolic , representing the people still in the drug game .
He was often asked about them in interviews .
He wrote `` Rubber Band Man '' as an explanation .
T.I. raps `` call me trouble man '' in this song , and brags about carrying a gun in each hand -LRB- `` 9 in my right , .45 in my other hand '' -RRB- .
Unfortunately , he was on probation for 1998 charges of distribution of cocaine , for which he served a year in jail , and he was n't supposed to have a gun in either hand .
The day he finished shooting the video for this song , he found out there was a warrant for his arrest .
Police found a gun in his house and called his probation officer , who had T.I. arrested .
He served about 9 months in jail , and was arrested on gun charges again in 2007 .
This track was produced by David Banner , who had a hit of his own two years later with `` Play . ''
Banner went on to produce tracks for Chris Brown and Lil Wayne .
