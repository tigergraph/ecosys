This song finds the three Pistol Annies celebrating everything we are told that we should n't indulge in , from prozac and pain pills to cigarettes , booze and truck-stop burgers with fries .
Problem is the girls are spending so much on their vices that they are broke .
The debt-laden trio ca n't afford to repay the boys in the band or repair their clamped out van .
The video takes the same route .
Shot in Nashville , the tongue-in-cheek clip features Lonestar Annie -LRB- Miranda Lambert -RRB- , Holler Annie -LRB- Angaleena Presley -RRB- and Hippie Annie -LRB- Ashley Monroe -RRB- driving around various parts of the city and rehearsing for a gig with their instruments and various vices .
`` We left the driving to me since I was just smoking , '' said Presley , laughing .
