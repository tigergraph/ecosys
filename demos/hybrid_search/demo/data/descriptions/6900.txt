Dapo Daniel Oyebanjo is a Nigerian Afrobeat singer-songwriter and harmonica player who records under the moniker of D'banj , which is a combination of his first name Dapo and surname Oyebanjo .
Following the tragic death of his older brother in a plane crash , D'banj ditched a career in the army .
He started playing his late brother 's harmonica , which was recovered from the crash and soon became a self-taught master of the instrument .
In 2005 he recorded his debut album , No Long Thing , which yielded several hit singles .
Since then D'banjo has become a superstar in his home continent , winning many music awards including Best African Act at the 2007 MTV Europe Music Awards 2007 , Artist of the Year at both the 2008 and 2009 MTV Africa Music Awards and Best International Act ; Africa at the 2011 BET Awards .
In June 2011 , D'banj signed to Kanye West 's G.O.O.D Music and this is the first single released under his new label .
Nigerian Sesan Ogunro directed the song 's music video , which features cameos from D'banj 's label mate Big Sean and Sugababe Keisha Buchanan .

Whilst Charles Dickens ' poor workhouse boy Oliver Twist famously asked for more gruel , only to be rebuffed by Mr. Bumble , D'banj 's wish is more fanciful .
He confesses to his girl that his desire is to get with certain famous pop divas - including Beyonc√© , Rihanna and Nicki Minaj - but ca n't because he 's `` just like Oliver , Oliver , Oliver Twist . ''
He then tells his girl he knows her secret is that she likes such musicians as Trey Songz and his Nigerian producer Don Jazzy , before suggesting the truth is she also is just like , `` Oliver , Oliver , Oliver Twist . ''
The lyrics then grow increasingly bonkers and move even further away from Dickens ' Victorian novel as D'banj cries , `` Why you come dey shake e , shake e , bum bum . ''
