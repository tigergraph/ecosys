The song 's music video was directed by Eric Wareheim from Tim and Eric Awesome Show , Great Job !
The surreal clip features Ray Wise , best known as Leland Palmer on Twin Peaks , who we see lip-syncing Victoria Legrand 's verse before an adoring crowd during a weird American football game .
Wareheim commented in NME : `` It was the idea of Victoria -LSB- Legrand -RSB- to use Ray .
The contrast of that rugged face with the ethereal vocals was a home run . ''
