This is the first single from the Contemporary Christian Music singer songwriter Phil Wickham 's fourth studio album , Response .
The theme running throughout the record is that of giving a voice to the appreciation and adoration of God in every chapter of life .
`` When I see the different aspects of who God is in different situations of life , my response to that love can be seen as jumping for joy where other times I respond by saying , ` You are Holy and I am not , ' humbled and falling on my face , '' said Wickham .
