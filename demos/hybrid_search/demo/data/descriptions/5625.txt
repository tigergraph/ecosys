This song is about realizing what you have and how lucky you are .
It tells you that going into bars is n't the solution to your problems .
You have to work them out on your own .
There are lots of good things in life , and you ca n't find them by spending all your time in a bar .
-LRB- thanks , Liz - Patterson , CA -RRB- Music row hitmaker Craig Wiseman and American country music singer-songwriter Jim Collins wrote the song .
Wiseman recalled to The Boot the writing of the lyrics : `` The security guard where we were writing that day , Rusty Martin , was a friend of ours .
He had lost his wife to cancer .
In fact , he had moved up -LSB- to Nashville -RSB- because of that .
Jim and I were just about to write another song .
We were talking about what if you just sat there and watched your wife die .
We both just sat there and were sort of stunned for a minute .
We said , ` OK , let 's get a cup of coffee and write a song !
` That -LSB- thought -RSB- was obviously still in the room .
It was not -LSB- Rusty 's -RSB- story or anything , but we definitely had the wisdom of somebody there in that song , that person being the bartender , knowing a relationship like that .
I actually played Rusty the song .
I told him the song was inspired by him in some ways so I want to make sure he was OK with it .
He went home and played it for his daughter.I had gotten in touch with the funeral home where he had buried his wife and had a matching foot stone made for her that was engraved with ` The Good Stuff . '
I went and gave it to him at the No. 1 party .
Everybody was crying .
I always say this song came about because of three long , happy marriages , and two of them are still going . ''
This was Billboard 's # 1 Country single of 2002 .
