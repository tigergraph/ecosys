Linkin Park close their fifth studio album , Living Things , with this track , which finds Chester Bennington singing regretfully to someone , who is intent on self-destruction .
That person could be either a friend or lover .
The song plays over the end credits of the 20th Century Fox film , Abe Lincoln : Vampire Hunter .
