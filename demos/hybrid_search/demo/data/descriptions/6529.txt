It 's often very stressful for a father when his daughter begins dating , and that 's the subject of this song .
Fathers have found different ways to handle this , and can be very persuasive in convincing the young man dating his daughter that it 's in his best interest to behave .
In this song , the narrator recalls a speech given to him when he was a teenager by his girlfriend 's father .
The speech was intended to ensure the narrator treated his girl with respect , and the father made it clear that he would be waiting for them to come home , and probably still cleaning his gun .
Many years later he finds himself giving the same speech to his daughter 's boyfriend .
This was written by the Nashville songwriters Casey Beathard and Marla Cannon-Goodman .
This was the fourth release from If You 're Going Through Hell to top the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart .
The first three # 1 hits from the album were `` If You 're Going Through Hell -LRB- Before the Devil Even Knows -RRB- , '' `` Watching You '' and `` These Are My People . ''
This was the first time in seven years an artist had pulled four chart-toppers from the same album .
The previous performer to achieve this was Atkins ' label mate Tim McGraw who pulled four straight # 1s from his 2001 Set This Circus Down CD .
Atkins told CMT News that this song `` is like a funny joke that is true . ''
He explained : `` That could have been really just a dumb redneck kind of song , but the songwriters - Casey Beathard and Marla Cannon - took a very intelligent approach to that idea .
You know , dad 's out there joking - ` I 'll be cleaning my gun when my daughter goes out there on her date . '
They took the intelligent approach about it , with the speeches that you go through - the speeches that we really all should remember , but we do n't .
They 're all very important things , but yet when it comes to your little girl , you 're going to remember that speech .
My audience , I think , is intelligent rednecks . ''
