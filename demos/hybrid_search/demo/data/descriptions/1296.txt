This song is about a man who spends every day on a street corner , apparently homeless or mentally disturbed , staring vacantly and shouting at random people .
The lyrics speculate that maybe this guy has the right idea - `` Do you love it enough to leave it , just like the lonely man there on the corner ? ''
