Frontman Alex Kapranos told Mojo December 2008 that this is possibly Franz Ferdinand 's most direct rock song to date .
Kapronos explained to the New Musical Express January 17 , 2009 : `` It 's about rejecting God , but acknowledging that we all need to believe in something , and that it would be easier if there was a Charlton Heston in the sky with an omniscient beard . ''
Kapranos told Mojo magazine February 2009 that all the tracks on Tonight : Franz Ferdinand take place at night , apart from this song , `` which is at 5.05 in the morning , which kind of is the night , if it 's a heavy one . ''
