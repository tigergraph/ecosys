Frontwoman Bethany Cosentino asks in this song , `` When did my life stop being so fun ? ''
before going on to complain that she feels lonely , homesick and tired .
Speaking with Lucy Jones of the Daily Telegraph , Cosentino explained the lyrics reflected her frame of mind following the success of Best Coast 's debut set , Crazy For You .
`` Our first record was so successful and I thought ` I 'm never going to be able to make something that good again , ' '' she said .
`` My life became very chaotic .
The success of the band really changed things for me , my friendships , living situation .
Everything went from being standard and normal for 22 years to being flipped on its head .
I never had a chance to let it all sink in and deal with it .
A lot of the new songs are written from perspective of a girl who is very self-conscious and confused . ''
