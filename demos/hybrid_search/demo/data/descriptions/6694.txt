This ballad about infidelity and remorse features the backing of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra 's 16-piece string section .
The piece was arranged by the late Motown legend David J. Van De Pitte whose credits include Marvin Gaye 's What 's Going On .
Van de Pitte passed away on August 9th 2009 , not long after this song was recorded .
Kem explained the song in an interview with SoulTracks : `` Part of the concept behind the album was vulnerability , and I try to write the words that men do n't know how to say that women definitely need to hear .
I think ` Why .
... ' speaks to that .
I know that there are a lot of brothers out there who feel the same way ; those experiences are n't exclusive to me .
We know when we 're wrong and it 's good to have music that you can put on when you do n't have the words to help you express that sentiment . ''
