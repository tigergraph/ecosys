This Mike Reid and Rory Michael Bourke written number was originally recorded by Don Williams and has also been sung by Billy Dean .
Turner explained to Roughstock that producer Frank Roger 's assistant emailed the song to him one morning before he went into the studio to see what he thought about it .
Turner added : `` That song really helped me to remember why I 'm doing this and what songs I need to look for when recording albums .
Because this song in particular , it has a very classic and timeless feel , with a very unique melody with a very heartfelt , positive message and a different way of writing a lyric , It 's just classic Don Williams .
He was one of the best at choosing great songs and the fact that he cut the song proves that he thought a lot of it and was always consistent about picking songs with the classic and timeless feel .
It got me really excited about going into the studio that day and not only does it remind me of the type of song I need to be looking for but when I heard it , I also felt strongly that I could make it a Josh Turner song , make it my own .
I was very pleased with how it turned out and now there 's talk of it being a single at some point . ''
