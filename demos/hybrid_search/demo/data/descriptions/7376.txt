Following a 17-year hiatus , Public Image Ltd reformed in September 2009 with multi-instrumentalist Scott Firth replacing the late PiL guitarist John McGeoch .
Frontman John Lydon financed the reunion using money he earned doing a UK television commercial for Country Life butter .
This is the title track of the band 's first record since getting back together , the vinyl only EP was , er , dropped on April 21 , 2012 .
Lydon discussed the song 's meaning during an interview with NME : `` What started out as a bit of fun in the studio became this song about wanting to readdress the balance in society , '' he explained .
`` It 's about police , it 's about politicians and it 's about the Rupert Murdoch situation .
All we need is one drop to readdress the balance .
One drop and we can get it back on the good foot .
We can change this whole sorry situation .
It 's a timeless song and that 's why I sing : ` We are the ageless .
We are all teenagers . '
We do n't get old , society makes us old . ''
The song also featured on This PiL , the band 's first album for 20 years .
It was recorded at Steve Winwood 's studio , which is located in a barn in the middle of the Cotswolds in southern England .
Lydon told Reuters that the former Spencer Davis Group and Traffic singer did pop into their sessions , `` but only with one ear to the barn door , and then he pretended to be watering the daisies .
So he never contributed , but it was great he rented us the studio . ''
