Grouplove is an American Indie Rock band who specialize in catchy , summery songs .
They first got together when New York City keyboardist Hannah Hooper and singer Christian Zucconi attended an art residency on the island of Crete .
The pair formed a friendship with London born and bred guitarist Sean Gadd , Los Angeles pro surfer and musician Andrew Wessen , and his childhood drummer friend Ryan Rabin , who is the son of former Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin .
The quintet decided before returning home , that they would reunite and flesh out the plans they had drawn .
Back in the United States they recorded some of the material they 'd written together in Crete at Ryan Rabin 's home studio and released it in 2010 as their debut eponymous EP .
Their debut album , Never Trust a Happy Song was released through Canvasback/Atlantic Records on September 13 , 2011 .
This piece of electronic fun became their first Hot 100 entry after it was used on the soundtrack for the Apple iPod Touch TV commercial , `` Share the Fun . ''
