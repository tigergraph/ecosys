`` Shell Games '' was the first released single off of the 2011 Bright Eyes album The People 's Key , the eighth studio album by American indie/folk band , Bright Eyes .
On it , band frontman Conor Oberst sings of love and alienation from a more adult perspective , coupled with the desire to share his burdens and seek help carrying his `` heavy load . ''
The music video for the song , directed by Nik Fackler , is set in a ramshackle yet stylish house draped in fabric , with the band playing as though for a house show for themselves .
The group performance then moves outside around a bonfire , before the final shots , presumably the morning after the house show party , reveal that the house has been overtaken by unusual zoo animals .
Saddle Creek originally gave the song away as a free download in December 2010 .
Label owner Robb Nansel told Billboard magazine it is , `` a good introduction to the record .
It starts out sounding like what you expect from Bright Eyes , then ventures off into this other territory . ''
The song 's use of synth pop and anthemic major chords recall 1980s pop rock .
The People 's Key marked a turning point for Bright Eyes .
Oberst told Spinner , `` The songs -LSB- on new album ` The People 's Key ' -RSB- were written all over the course of the last year and a half .
When I started writing the first few songs , I did n't know what direction the record was going to take .
Once the first three or four songs were written , I started to see the template emerge of what was going to become the record . ''
