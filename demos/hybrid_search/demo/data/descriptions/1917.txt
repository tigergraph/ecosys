Minneapolis indie rockers Howler have been likened to such skinny-jeaned acts as The Strokes and The Vaccines .
Speaking with NME , frontman Jordan Gatesmith said that such tracks on their debut album America Give Up as ` America ' hark back further , having been influenced by the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Jonathan Richman .
He added : `` There 's not really been a great rock record , or even a punk record , in ages .
I keep hearing a lot of witch house stuff , chillwave , shoegazey keyboards with Casio drums .
But not rock , so we wanted to make it dirty rock 'n' roll . ''
America Give Up was titled after this pseudo-Springsteen anthem .
Gatesmith told UK newspaper The Sun that it was an attempt to , `` make fun of a country that tries too hard to be the biggest and best , in a somewhat unhealthy way . ''
Gatesmith told NME this is a `` joke protest song . ''
He explained : `` Secretly we 're all obsessed with dad-rock stuff like Bruce Springsteen , so we had this idea that we 'd be able to do a Jonathan Richman-style version of ` Born In The USA . ' ''
