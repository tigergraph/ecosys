This light-hearted love song about an old friend of Heap 's was written by her in Hawaii during an extended round the world writing trip .
It ends wryly : `` And this is where I was going to sing your name/Over and over again ... / But I chickened out in the final minute / ` Cos I thought you probably would n't like it . ''
After competing her round the world trip Heap finished the album at her childhood home in Essex , converting her old playroom in the basement into a studio .
She told The Sunday Times that the album got its name from the distinctive elliptical shape of the house .
