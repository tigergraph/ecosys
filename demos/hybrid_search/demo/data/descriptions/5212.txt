R&B singer-songwriter Elle Varner wrote this low-tempo anthem for all the girls that have fallen for a male pal only to find he 's not interested in taking their friendship any further .
`` I have so many guy friends , and if you 've ever had a friend that you were in love with , '' she told MTV News before erupting into laughter .
`` I think we all have .
I love that about the album : It 's so relatable for guys , girls , kids , adults .
It 's like the human experience .
I think that 's my gift in this world is to put experience into music . ''
Elle wrote and produced this song with her songwriter and producer father , Jimmy Varner , who has collaborated with the likes of Gerald Alston , Kool & the Gang , and Will Downing .
