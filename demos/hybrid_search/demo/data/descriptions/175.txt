Lead singer Geoff Rickly told fans at a concert before he sang this song that it was about how he and his best friend at the time got into a fistfight and did n't speak for years .
His best friend was shot in the head and killed while playing with a gun on vacation and Geoff never got a chance to apologize .
He said he always had dreams of his friend running down the stairs of his attic where they used to hang out , hence the name `` Steps Ascending . ''
