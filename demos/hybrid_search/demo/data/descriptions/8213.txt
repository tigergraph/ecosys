Fallon of Cherish said on their MySpace site that this song , produced by Eric Hudson , delivered a story that flips tradition and puts men on the receiving end for a change .
`` Basically , you are telling your boyfriend that you were with his best friend before you two were together .
But , you waited awhile to tell him because you did not know how .
We thought it was a way to give guys a taste of their own medicine . ''
Fallon added that the song is autobiographical .
