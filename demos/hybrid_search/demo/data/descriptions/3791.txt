A Jewish Princess is a stereotype of a bratty , privileged Jewish girl .
This song attracted attention from the Anti-Defamation League , to which Zappa denied an apology , arguing : `` Well , I did n't make up the idea of a Jewish Princess .
They exist , so I wrote a song about them . ''
-LRB- thanks , Mischa - Winnipeg , Canada -RRB- The ADL was founded in the wake of the trial of Leo Frank in 1913 , a case which inspired the contemporary song `` Little Mary Phagan '' and a later , and far from inspired musical , Parade , which includes such instantly forgettable numbers as `` Come On Up To My Office '' and `` I Am Trying To Remember .
`` While the misnamed Anti-Defamation League is an organisation that could find anti-Semitism in an egg cup , it is difficult to take issue with its claim that the song is obscene - it is a rare Zappa song that is n't !
- but for once its well-documented wire-pulling had entirely the undesired effect.In his 1993 book The Fatal Embrace : Jews And The State , Benjamin Ginsberg relates how in the late 1940s , the ADL would approach the publishers of major newspapers and the owners of radio stations and blackmail them into giving anti-Semitic individuals and organisations -LSB- real and imagined -RSB- the silent treatment .
Their more overt attempt to silence Zappa backfired , for as Miles points out : ` Because of the power of the ADL , `` Jewish Princess '' received more press than any other Zappa song ' .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 2 -RRB- There have been several biographies of the inimitable Mr. Zappa , including by Barry Miles , whose book , Frank Zappa , was published by Atlantic Books of London in 2005 .
Herein , Miles says of the song and of the reaction of the ADL and Zappa 's non-reaction to the ADL 's reaction : ' `` Jewish Princess '' brought Zappa up against the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith -LRB- ADL -RRB- , a powerful Jewish lobby group who filed a protest with the Federal Communications Commission -LRB- FCC -RRB- to have the record banned from airplay -LRB- a rather pointless exercise , as Zappa 's album tracks never received airplay anyway -RRB- , claiming that it contained `` vulgar , sexual and anti-Semitic references which leave very little to the imagination .
`` Zappa replied : `` I used to think that Jewish people had a sense of humour before I got that letter from the ADL ... '' adding `` The ADL is a noisemaking organisation that tries to apply pressure on people in order to manufacture a stereotype image of Jews that suits their idea of a good time .
They go around saying that other people are saying things that produce stereotype images of Jews . ''
Zappa wrote an answer song called `` Catholic Girls '' for his Joe 's Garage album later in 1979 .
Kelly Fisher Lowe 's The Words and Music of Frank Zappa has it that when Zappa got criticized for `` Jewish Princess , '' he wrote `` Catholic Girls '' as an answer to say , `` Fine , they 're slutty freaks , too ! ''
Then he either ended up writing the whole opera Joe 's Garage around that song , or just chucked it into it .
