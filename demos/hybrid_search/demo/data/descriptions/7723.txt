This is one of two tracks on Home that Rudimental recorded with Emeli Sandé .
Their collaboration happened after the drum and bass quartet and the Scottish singer-songwriter snuck away from the Brit Awards nominations party earlier in 2013 .
`` We 're suckers for a soulful voice no matter how famous they are or are n't , '' Amor confessed to Digital Spy .
Amir Amor recalled this collaboration with Emeli Sandé to The Sun : `` We 'd had a rough idea for ` More Than Anything ' for about a year and did n't know what to do with it .
When Emeli came along , we sat around a table and started writing the lyrics together and it all fell into place .
It did n't matter it was Emeli Sandé .
The song just worked . ''
