Chad Wolf , the frontman and songwriter of Swedish-American pop/rock band Carolina Liar , told RockFeedback that the lyrics to the songs on Coming to Terms tell stories - `` every one is based on something true . ''
Wolf gave the example of this song as being inspired by the memory of a conversation he had with a friend the night before he moved from his hometown of Charleston , South Carolina to Los.Angeles .
He explained : `` We needed some inspiration to write a road song , a song about traveling and moving on .
I knew straight away what that story was , dug up my notebook and the song was written . ''
This song was used in the pilot episode of CBS 's teen drama 90210 .
