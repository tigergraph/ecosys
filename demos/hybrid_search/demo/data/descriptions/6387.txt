This sombre song concerns English sea explorer Henry Hudson , who in 1611 was cast adrift by his crew , while searching for the Northwest Passage .
Vocalist Ezra Koenig told NME : `` I had this little poem I 'd written once , imagining Henry Hudson when he was first exploring over here .
There was something that always struck me as dark and funny that Hudson Bay , which obviously was named after him , was the place that he was set adrift by his mutinous crew and left to die . ''
Here are three more songs on our database about explorers : `` Mr. Powell '' by Ozark Mountain Daredevils .
`` Amerigo '' by Patti Smith Songfacts .
`` Antarctica '' by Al Stewart .
The song has a different vibe to anything Vampire Weekend had done before and is their first true minor key tune .
The songs on Vampires of the City are decidedly more from-the-gut and less edited than the band 's previous releases .
`` Just in terms of writing music , it was n't thinking in terms of ` Oh these are two interesting things , let 's put them in a song and make something new out of it , ' '' guitarist/keyboardist Rostam Batmanglij told Spin magazine .
`` It was more about ` That 's the melody that was written on that day or that 's the way I play the piano and that 's the way it sounds .
I do n't know when I started playing like that but at some point I did and this is a recording of that . '
It 's distinct because it 's instinctive .
And maybe that 's why this was a hard record to make : we wanted it to be simple and bare , we wanted you to hear us coming through the speakers .
There was one song that was just a bass line , drums and vocals .
And we tried adding all kinds of other stuff to it , but Ezra was actually the one who said , ` No , we can do it .
We can make a chorus as big and powerful and we can do it with those three elements . '
He was right . ''
