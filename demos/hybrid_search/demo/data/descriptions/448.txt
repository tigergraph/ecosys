This was written by Ne-Yo together with the Norwegian production team Stargate .
Ne-Yo was initially not over-enthusiastic about writing for the actress/singer but after she recorded the song he swiftly changed his mind .
The R&B singer-songwriter explained to Billboard magazine : `` I got ta admit , we were like ... Lindsay Lohan ? '
I mean , I 've written for Beyonce , Mary J. Blige , Rihanna , Celine Dion and ... Lindsay Lohan ?
But I will say this ; we gave her a quality record and she did a ridiculously fabulous job .
I was so shocked I had to call her and apologize for what I was thinking because she did so good .
I think the world is gon na be surprised . ''
This was not only Lohan 's first single to chart on the Hot Dance Club Play , but also her first # 1 hit on that list .
Lohan 's only previous chart-topper was `` Over , '' which spent three weeks at # 1 on the Bubbling Under the Hot 100 survey in 2005 .
Ne-Yo told People magazine that the song is about strength .
He explained : `` It 's basically about a woman being strong enough to get what she wants when she wants it .
In this case , ` Bossy ' is a term that describes confidence and power . ''
