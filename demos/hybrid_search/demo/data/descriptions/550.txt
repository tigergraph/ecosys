This is the third single from R&B singer songwriter Toni Braxton 's sixth studio album , Pulse .
The song was co-written by Lucas Secon and Makeba Riddick .
Secon has worked with a diverse group of artists including Mos Def , Damian Marley , The Pussycat Dolls and Kylie Minogue .
He told HitQuarters : `` That was a track I had that Vincent Herbert - who signed -LSB- Lady -RSB- Gaga and who consults on Toni - actually heard , and said , That 's Toni 's single.It 's kind of a mix of old school/new school , it 's got an Evelyn ` Champagne ' King sample in the verses , and then the chorus it 's more like soulful rate .
I tried to do something where I respected her roots but also introduced her to a new audience who do n't know her - like my son . ''
The song 's music video was directed by filmmaker Bille Woodruff who has previously worked with Braxton on a number of her clips including those for `` Un-Break My Heart '' and `` Yesterday . ''
Secon explained to HitQuarters how he wrote the song with Riddick : `` I had sent her some lyrics and some concepts , and on that particular one she 'd gone in and written the rest of it , along with the melodies , and cut it in New York .
We then met in LA , cut the vocals with Toni , and then together tweaked it a little bit . ''
