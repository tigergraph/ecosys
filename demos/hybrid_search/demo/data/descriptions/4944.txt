This is the title track and first single from the North Carolina folk-rock trio The Avett Brothers .
It was their major label debut after five independent albums .
Rick Rubin , whose credits include Johnny Cash , Neil Diamond and The Red Hot Chili Peppers , produced the album .
The chorus of this piano ballad goes , `` Brooklyn , Brooklyn , take me in . ''
Scott Avett explained to Spinner that the song was inspired by a gig at Brooklyn 's Galapagos .
`` It was the coolest place we 'd ever been , and the furthest from home we 'd ever been in every sense , '' he said .
`` So the Brooklyn chorus kind of embodies the rest of the lyrics . ''
This autumnal track was chosen by Starbucks iTunes as their Pick of the Week for September 22 , 2009 .
Scott Avett told Rolling Stone magazine that I And Love And You was inspired by an unlikely classic Rubin production : the Red Hot Chili Peppers ' Blood Sugar Sex Magik , `` But without the heroin addiction . ''
