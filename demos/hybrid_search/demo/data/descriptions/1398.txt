This song is about the rock-star relationship with many different women .
Like `` Blood Sugar Sex Magik , '' this song was the namesake for the album despite not being released as a single , or being a featured song on the album .
This song was shortened from the original version , and the booklet for the One Hot Minute album contains extra lyrics to the song .
The second verse was shortened , and originally contained the lyrics , `` A tiny wink is all , all we have .
No , it 's not much more , but do n't get mad . ''
The Red Hot Chili Peppers stopped playing this , along with every other song from One Hot Minute , when Dave Navarro left the band .
The band says Dave 's playing style does not fit in with John Frusciante 's style , and the songs do n't fit in with their show .
