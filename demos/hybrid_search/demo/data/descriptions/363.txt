A # 1 Country hit , this became Rodney Atkins ' signature song , telling the story about the breaking down the walls of life standing in your way .
The inspirational story relates to Atkins , whose adoptive parents helped him through a childhood respiratory infection and taught him the value of perseverance .
In a city crowded with stars , Rodney joined the ranks of Nashville 's top Country singers soon after releasing his debut album in 2003 .
back in 2006 , `` If You 're Going through Hell , '' had a big impact on one of his fans that year .
Learning that this fan was dying of cancer , Rodney arranged a visit to her hospital room in Michigan , where he played a tune or two for her .
This hit song tells Atkins has made many appearances at children 's hospitals where he performs this song for patients who are sometimes terminal .
An early example was on October 25 , 2006 , when he played the song in the hospital room of a young St. Clair , Michigan girl named Maddie Trudel , who was dying of cancer .
This was written by the husband and wife songwriting team of Sam and Annie Tate , along with the Nashville songwriting mainstay Dave Berg .
The trio also collaborated on the Reba McEntire hit `` Somebody . ''
