This was written by Jennifer Adan and Corey Batten .
It was the first song that they wrote together .
Adan told AOL the story of the song : `` We happened to be sitting next to some red flowers at Edgehill Cafe in Nashville .
We just started small on a ` wildflower ' idea , and then the song grew out of that .
` Just like in life , it 's the little things that we sometimes fail to notice that could make the biggest difference in our lives , ' Cory said , talking about the wildflower idea .
Cory and I both knew we had created something special that day.After we wrote it , we both started pitching it around town , trying to get it heard by as many people as possible .
Cory and his publisher , Kent Blazy , are the ones who got it to Scott Hendricks , who produced Blake 's album Startin Fires .
He fell in love with the song , and the rest is history.I have been writing songs since I was 10 years old , and this song is my first big cut and hit .
I have dreamed about this moment all my life , seeing my name in the CD credits , hearing my song on the radio and especially hearing people sing along .
Blake Shelton did an amazing job singing it , and I am so grateful to him for recording the song .
His performance really brings the song to life . ''
This was Shelton 's second consecutive # 1 on the Hot Country chart , following his cover of Michael Bubl√© 's `` Home . ''
