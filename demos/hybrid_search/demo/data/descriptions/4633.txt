On this track Spektor compares a failed relationship to forgetting the lyrics of one 's favorite song .
Spektor is well known for using her voice as an instrument to harmonize different sounds , and this song 's title reflects that .
Entertainment Weekly asked her if these vocal inflections are just something she does naturally ?
She replied : `` Yeah , I sing and hum so much in life .
When I 'm left to be on my own , I just go f -- ing nuts .
If someone would be listening at the door , they would think there are 30 different people in the room .
I love finding sounds , and finding where you feel it .
Sometimes you feel it more in your throat , sometimes in your nose .
It 's coming out of your actual body , which is the weirdest instrument of all .
Most of the time I end up messing around and looking for new things .
It 's almost like when you go back to the same books all the time , and you 're constantly reading through but you get to find that one sentence that it 's like you 've read it for the first time .
I think that 's what happens with voices and instruments . ''
