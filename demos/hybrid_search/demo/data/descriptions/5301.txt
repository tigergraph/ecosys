Written by all four band members , this song is about growing up and moving on in the world , leaving the past behind you .
It deals with how your perceptions change as you look back on your youth .
-LRB- thanks , Arianna - Largo , FL -RRB- This was a very important song for the group , as they were worried about meeting expectations in the wake of their highly acclaimed first album , Hot Fuss .
According to Brandon Flowers , when he came up with the lyrics `` He does n't look a thing like Jesus , but he talks like a gentleman , '' he knew he had something special and that things would work out .
The original version of this song was used in the 2007 video game Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock .
-LRB- thanks , Jonathan - Johnstown , PA -RRB- This was the first single from Sam 's Town , which is The Killers second album .
Much of the album was influenced by Bruce Springsteen , who often wrote about restless youth .
There are two videos for this song .
In one version , the man at the beginning finds the girl on the hill and in the second version the girls jumps off the hill .
-LRB- thanks , Katie - Tuscaloosa , AL -RRB-
