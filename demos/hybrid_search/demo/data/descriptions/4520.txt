This is the title track of Australian Indie Rock band The Panics ' third album .
Singer and songwriter Jae Laffer told The Independent May 22 , 2009 that he wrote it during a troubled period following a difficult relationship .
He explained : `` I ended up taking antidepressants for a couple of years , which is really weird for me because I 'm a pretty happy-go-lucky character but I was having severe panic attacks -- the kind where you drop your shopping and have to crawl out of the supermarket .
It 's when you find yourself just staying in and drinking too much and spending too much time in your own head .
The cruel guards were the medication I was taking .
Drugs take away the bad stuff in people 's lives , but they knock the top end off as well and blur your whole world . ''
Cruel Guards won the Best Adult Contemporary Album award at the 2008 ARIAs .
