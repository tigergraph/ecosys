This is a track from The Sound Of Sunshine , the seventh studio album by American Alternative Rock/Hip Hop act Michael Franti & Spearhead .
This is not the first Michael Franti song title to contain the word `` Hey . ''
On this recording he makes hey with a treble ` Hey ! '
Franti explained as to why all the ` heys ' on his website : `` With ` Say Hey ' and ` Hey World ' and now this , I guess ` Hey ' is becoming a big word with me .
At first this song was called , ` No Matter How Life Is Today . '
But every time we walked offstage after having played it , people would say , ` Hey , where can we find that ` Hey , Hey , Hey ' song . '
So we actually did a vote online on our website about what we should call this .
So the people have spoken , and they say , ` Hey . ' ''
