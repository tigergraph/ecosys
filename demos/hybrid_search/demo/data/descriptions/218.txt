Switchfoot is a Contemporary Christian band with a broad appeal , as their songs work on a secular level as well .
In this song , Jon Foreman sings about the importance of living in the present , taking control of your fate , and not simply awaiting the afterlife .
It 's the first song on Vice Verses , which was their second album released on their own label .
In our 2011 interview with Jon Foreman , he explained : `` I think that this record was a little more personal than it was taking from other subject material .
And most of the songs are in the first person and - I mean , the first word of the whole record is ` I ' -LRB- ` I 've tasted fire , I 'm ready to come alive ' -RRB- .
But I think the whole thing is definitely a little bit more of an inward look at the struggle rather than being inspired by books or something I was reading . ''
