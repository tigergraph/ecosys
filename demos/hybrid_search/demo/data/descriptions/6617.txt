This is the third single from London-based singer-songwriter Frank Turner 's third studio album , Poetry of the Deed .
Turner described the song to BBC DJ Steve Lamacq on his Radio 2 show as `` an old fashioned love song . ''
He added : `` A friend of mine and I were discussing my first two records and he pointed out that I only wrote miserable songs about relationships to date and maybe I should think on that subject so I decided to have a stab at writing a happy love song .
` Isabel ' was the result and it 's about my wonderful then-girlfriend . ''
