Alex Clare is a British singer-songwriter from Golders Green , London .
This punk-rock thrasher is the first single from his debut album with Island Records , The Lateness Of The Hour .
It was written during writing sessions with producers Diplo & Switch -LRB- responsible for the Jamaican dancehall project Major Lazer and M.I.A. 's `` Paper Planes '' among many others -RRB- .
`` They understand what I want from the arrangements , '' said Clare .
`` I love those heavy , sine-wave bass lines and they knew how to push them way beyond even my expectations . ''
The song 's music video is a strange one featuring a disheveled bearded man and a bikini-clad girl coughing up water .
`` It 's about sleepwalking , '' explained Clare to The Guardian .
`` It 's about people waking up in a strange place and not realizing how they got there . ''
According to Clare , this song is `` about going on a bender . ''
