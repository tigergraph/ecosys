Fallen Empires breaks new ground for Alternative Rock band Snow Patrol with several tracks featuring a more dance friendly sound .
Frontman Gary Lightbody said this electro-dance call-to-arms club anthem is a , `` proper night out track . ''
He continued , `` It 's full blown electro .
There 's always been a dance element to our music , but this time we 've been a bit bolder with it .
I 'm looking forward to hearing some of these songs in a club because it 'll get people going .
I always see people walking off the dance floor when they play our records , we 're not that kind of band .
` I 'll Never Let Go ' might change that . ''
The song features the vocals of the LA Inner City Mass Gospel Choir who come from Compton in south central Los Angeles .
The song is powered by the sound of dozens of different drums picked up by percussionist Jonny Quinn from a local music store in LA. `` I was inspired by the drummers I used to see on Venice Beach in Santa Monica , '' he said .
`` They were always out there playing - some of them were great , some of them were s -- t , but they all had different drums and drumming styles .
I just went down to the store and picked up loads of different kits .
I started playing them and we layered drum over drum over drum .
It was so painful playing them all .
By the end of it , my hands had totally swollen up . ''
This is the opening track of Fallen Empires .
The album is bookended by two stories of separate homeless people that Lightbody met in Santa Monica .
Here 's what he told Billboard magazine regarding this song : `` I 'd meet him pretty much every day at some point and he would always not remember who I was ... -LSB- One day -RSB- I said I said ` take care of yourself , you know , man . '
And -LSB- as -RSB- I was walking way , he shouted after me , ` I 'll never let go , do n't worry about me .
I 'll never let go . '
And okay , can I make that into a song , I flat out asked him and he was like ` Yeah man , you do that . ' ''
