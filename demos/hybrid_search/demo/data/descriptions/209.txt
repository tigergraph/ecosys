This is the story of a white guy from a middle class background who loses his virginity to a black girl from a troubled background in the junior high bathroom .
Kid Rock says this story is ninety-nine percent true .
He is the white guy and the black chick is the mother of his only son .
The white guy plays father to a son she has with another man , and also fathers two of her other children .
He soon discovers that one of the children he thought was his , really was n't , so he takes his son and leaves .
The woman this song is about sued Rock for defamation and invasion of privacy .
She claimed the story is not true and also brought suit against Rolling Stone magazine for printing it .
