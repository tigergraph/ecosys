This was originally written by Jermaine Dupri , -LRB- `` It 's Like That , '' `` You Make Me Wan na '' -RRB- before Cuomo made some modifications .
The Weezer singer explained to Billboard magazine : `` He sent me a demo that was kind of like a half-finished song .
I absolutely loved it , I thought it was totally fun .
But it was just a little too much about partying and being ecstatic .
I do n't know ... I like it when songs have kind of conflicting tones in them , so I tried to change the lyrics , and I just could n't .
Every line I came up with just sounded stupid compared with his , so I went back and changed the music , and gave it some very sad chords filled with longing .
That changed the meaning of the lyrics .
I managed to change some tension in the lyrics without changing a word .
He said he loves it . ''
