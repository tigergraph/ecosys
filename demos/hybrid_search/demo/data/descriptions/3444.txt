Blind Faith was a Supergroup made up of Eric Clapton , Steve Winwood , Ginger Baker , and Ric Grech .
This is their only album .
Clapton played acoustic guitar on this , which he rarely did .
In his previous group , Cream , he played long , intense solos , something he wanted to get away from with Blind Faith .
Clapton sometimes plays this at his concerts , with a member of his band singing .
His bass player Nathan East would often sing it .
The band House of Lords covered this on their 1990 album Sahara .
Other artists to record it include Joe Cocker , Yvonne Elliman , Gilberto Gil and Widespread Panic .
-LRB- thanks , Amanda - Amawalk , NY -RRB- Winwood wrote this and sang lead .
Many critics noted that Blind Faith sounded a lot more like Winwood 's old band Traffic than Clapton 's Cream , which is what Clapton was going for .
The album cover was a photo of an 11-year-old girl .
She was naked and holding a model spaceship , which caused a lot of controversy .
They released an alternate cover with a picture of the band when stores refused to carry the original .
A common misconception is that Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood reunited at the Crossroads Guitar Festival , July 28 , 2007 , however , the first true live reunion occurred 2 months earlier at an event called Countryside Rocks at Highclere Castle , Hampshire , UK on May 19 , 2007 .
Steve Winwood performed his set and Eric came on later as a guest .
Together they played this song as well as `` Watch Your Step , '' `` Presence of the Lord , '' `` Crossroads , '' `` Little Queen Of Spades , '' `` Had to Cry Today '' and `` Gim me Some Lovin ' . ''
