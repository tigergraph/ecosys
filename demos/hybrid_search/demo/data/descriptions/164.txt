Carrie Underwood covered this Motley Crue power ballad for the farewell song on the 2009 American Idol show .
Some of the proceeds of the iTunes digital single release went to the Humane Society of the United States .
Underwood said in a statement : `` I 've always loved this song .
And besides being very fitting for ` Idol , ' to me , the title is also very fitting with animal rescue and finding animals their own homes . ''
The original version of this song was a track on Motley Crue 's 1985 album Theatre of Pain .
The single release charted at # 89 in the US and # 51 in the UK .
In 1991 a re-mixed version reached # 37 in both countries .
