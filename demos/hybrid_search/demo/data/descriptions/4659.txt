Dallas Green 's decision to quit as the singer in the post-hardcore band Alexisonfire in order to focus on his increasingly popular acoustic work under the moniker of City and Colour precipitated the group 's breakup in 2011 .
Green writes about the inner conflict he felt before leaving Alexisonfire on this break-up tune `` I wrote that song in the thick of the decision , '' he told The Huffington Post , `` on the last Alexis tour that we did in the States , on a day I had off , somewhere else , by myself .
I actually wanted it to be on -LSB- 2011 's -RSB- Little Hell , but it was just not working , musically I was wrestling with it .
So I gave up on that song .
I made the record , I got through all the drama of the band breaking up , and all of a sudden one day I went down to my basement and changed the rhythm and it just turned into this beautiful song that it is now .
It seemed so effortless .
When I look back I think it 's because I was n't ready to tell everyone , you know ?
Because when I was writing that song , I knew I had left the band , but nobody else knew .
I 'm pretty sure that 's what it was , my subconscious saying no . ''
