This song by American record producer Quincy Jones featured vocalists James Ingram , Al B. Sure , El DeBarge and Barry White .
All four seductive singers performed a verse each directed to the ladies .
In 2010 Jones recorded Q : Soul Bossa Nostra , an album featuring re-interpretations of songs associated with him .
Producer Jermaine Dupri called on Usher , Robin Thicke , Tyrese , LL Cool J , Tevin Campbell and Trey Songz to provide fresh vocals for the new version of this song and bought Barry White back from the grave as well .
`` Luckily , it 's a record that hip-hop really embraced as a ballad , '' Dupri told MTV News .
`` It was a record I lived with so much .
I kinda felt it was a record that was a part of my life .
So it was n't that hard for me to get into it .
But I just had to figure out all the ways and who to put on the song .
I feel that at the time -LSB- Quincy -RSB- made the record , each one of the guys had a certain thing for the ladies . ''
