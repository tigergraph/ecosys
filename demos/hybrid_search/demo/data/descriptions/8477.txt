Guitarist Anthony Armstrong explained to Artist Direct that this brooding cut finds vocalist Michael Barnes singing , `` about the damage we do as human beings . ''
He added : `` Character is defined by how we repair the damage .
If you use the word ` damage ' in a song , it 's going to be heavy .
It 's the heaviest one yet in all the right ways . ''
