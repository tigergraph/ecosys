Prince has been cited as a major influence on Of The Blue Colour Of The Sky .
On this funk-edged song , frontman Damian Kulash sings in a Prince-style falsetto .
He told Rolling Stone : `` Purple Rain is the record I 've listened to the most in my life .
This album is sort of like Purple Rain through broken speakers . ''
The song 's one shot music video was directed by Trish Sie , the sister of Damian Kulash , who had previously directed the band 's famous treadmill promo for `` Here It Goes Again '' .
The clip features the band members performing choreographed actions alongside a number of well-trained dogs and one goat , with the actions set in time to the song .
`` It took 124 takes , '' Kulash told UK 's NME magazine .
`` There were many more starts and stops but we actually have slates for 124 full takes .
The video you see is one whole take and what you see is all take 72 . ''
