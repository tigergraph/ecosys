Many of the tracks on Hundred More Years focus on lifting up others , and this song sees Battistelli singing about how passing on God 's love strengthens her own Christian walk .
The singer told Today 's Christian Music how this circle of doing and growing translating into more doing and more growing helps her cope with everyday struggles .
She explained : `` The more you walk in relationship with the Lord , the more you learn to trust him .
I 'm learning not to focus so much on the issues I think are so big right now -- our bus has broken down , or someone said something that frustrated me .
I 'm learning to slowly let things roll off my back , to say , ` Hey , God knew about this before it happened and He 's got a way out or a plan better than mine . '
I 've learned to stop freaking out and just trust that God knows what he 's doing .
He 's not going to leave me in a bad place because He never has before . ''
