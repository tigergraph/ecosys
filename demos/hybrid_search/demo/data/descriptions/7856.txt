During a discussion and performance at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles in January 2009 , Wilson offered a detail about his songwriting at the time .
He admitted : `` I had just drunk a half a bottle of Champagne , and I said , ` Hey , I feel like writing a song , ' So I wrote ` Love and Mercy half-drunk . ''
As this was the lead single from Wilson 's first ever solo album , this song garnered a lot of publicity at the time .
However , it failed to chart in either the UK or US .
This song features Brian Wilson on many of the backing vocals as well as lead vocals .
