Foals vocalist Yannis Philippakis told NME that this is a breakup song that was penned from a personal experience .
`` It 's from the idea that you do n't have control over your sphere and that people feel like they know you when they really fu -- ing do n't , '' he explained .
`` I wanted to kind of say , ` You 're never gon na know me . '
Even if they may know you it 's about wanting to tell somebody , ` You know what , you 're never gon na fu -- ing know me , even if you 're allowed in , you 're not gon na know me any more . ' ''
The song was first seen live when Foals performed it on the BBC show Later ... With Jools Holland on November 13 , 2012 .
In a separate interview with NME , the band cited this track as having a Funk influence , saying it `` had a Curtis Mayfield groove which was pretty unashamedly funk , for want of a better word . ''
