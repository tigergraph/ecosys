On this song frontwoman Nina Persson duets with cult Swedish singer Nikolai Dunger .
Persson told Planet Sound : `` I love the idea of duets , but too many are simple love songs .
I do n't understand that - you know the singers are n't going to f -- , so it feels fake and cheesy .
I 'd thought for a long time my voice would work well with Nikolai .
I seem to end up working with most of my friends in A Camp sooner or later . ''
