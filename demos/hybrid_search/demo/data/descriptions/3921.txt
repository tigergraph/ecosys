Cat Power , aka Chan Marshall , wrote this 11-minute , two-chord epic to cheer up her boyfriend 's daughter Lucia when she was dealing with online bullies .
Lucia was in love with David Bowie 's Ziggy Stardust album at the time and this song winks at one of his later tracks , `` Heroes . ''
`` It 's up to you .
To be a superhero , '' Marshall exults .
`` It 's up to you .
To be like nobody . ''
Marshall tried to get Bowie to sing backing on the track , but the Thin White Duke was n't available .
Instead , she got his friend and frequent collaborator Iggy Pop , to join her on the song 's chin-up refrain .
