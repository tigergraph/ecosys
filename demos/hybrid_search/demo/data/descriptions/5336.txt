This was released as the second single from R Kelly 's 11th album Write Me Back .
The long player was written and produced primarily by Kelly as the follow-up to his 2010 set Love Letter and it expands on that release 's Philadelphia Soul and Funk influences .
The song was released to digital music services on May 29 , 2012 .
The song samples Bill Withers ' 1977 hit `` Lovely Day , '' on which the American soul singer-songwriter holds a note for 18 seconds .
It is thought to be the longest held vocal note on any hit song .
Kelly penned this song after breaking up with a girl .
He explained the song 's meaning on Radio One Miami 's Russ Parr Morning Show : '' ` Feelin ' Single ' is about a good feelin ' , '' said Kellz .
`` It 's not so bad to feel single .
Single has its up points .
You get to go out , you get to mingle .
You ai n't got ta worry about callin ' or checkin ' in with no goddamn body .
You can take as many drinks as you want with your friends -- you can do certain things when you 're single . ''
