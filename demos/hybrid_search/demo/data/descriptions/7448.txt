This is a track from Welsh rock band Funeral for a Friend 's fifth studio album , Welcome Home Armageddon .
The record was Funeral for a Friend 's first long player to feature bass player Richard Boucher .
Drummer Ryan Richards discussed his contribution to this track in an interview with Rock Sound magazine : `` Having Rich join the band was a real bonus as he 's a great all round musician , and Owls was the first idea he brought to us on guitar , it actually came together the quickest out of any song on the record in a really natural and organic way .
When we 've done the more ` spacey ' and ` ambient ' songs in the past I think we 've probably been guilty of not putting the our stamp on them and let them drift away a bit , but we 've really made sure on ` Owls ' that , beneath all the harmonies , keys , strings and guitar effects , that there 's still power and urgency to the track - and that it 's something that really belongs on a Funeral for a Friend record .
