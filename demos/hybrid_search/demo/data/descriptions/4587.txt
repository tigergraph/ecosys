Some of the many samples on this track include `` Pump Me Up '' by Trouble Funk and `` Funky Drummer '' by James Brown , which gets a mention in the lyrics -LRB- `` Sound of the Funky Drummer '' -RRB- .
Discussing the song with Keyboard magazine in 1990 , Chuck D explained : `` We approach every record like it was a painting .
Sometimes , on the sound sheet , we have to have a separate sheet just to list the samples for each track .
We used about 150 , maybe 200 samples on Fear of a Black Planet .
` Fight the Power ' has , like , 17 samples in the first ten seconds .
For example , there 's three different drum loops that make one big drum loop : One is a standard Funkadelic thing , another is a Sly thing , and I think the third one is the Jacksons .
Then we took some sounds from a beat box .
The opening lick is the end of a Trouble Funk record , processed with doubling and reverb .
And the chorus is music going backwards . ''
This song first appeared on the soundtrack of the 1989 Spike Lee movie Do The Right Thing .
It was later used in the 2005 movie Jarhead , where `` Do n't Worry Be Happy '' also appears .
Probably Public Enemy 's most famous song , this embodies their message of black pride , and along the way takes shots at the white icons Elvis Presley -LRB- `` Elvis was a hero to most but he never meant s -- t to me '' -RRB- and John Wayne .
Even Bobby McFerrin could n't escape their wrath , as Chuck D raps , `` Do n't Worry Be Happy was a number one jam , damn if I say it you can slap me right here .
`` This militant and confrontational approach was designed to empower the black community and create some controversy along the way , which helped sell a lot of albums .
By this point , many of Public Enemy 's fans were young white guys who liked the beats and associated with the anti-authority message .
The group had also been through charges of anti-Semitism , reverse racism and homophobia , and emerged mostly unscathed -LRB- although their `` Minister of Information , '' Professor Griff , left the group after declaring `` Jews are wicked '' -RRB- , so declaring white people `` Rednecks '' in this song was n't that much of a risk .
Most of Public Enemy 's fans were too young to remember , but The Isley Brothers released a song called `` Fight The Power '' in 1975 .
Unlike Public Enemy , the Isley 's stated that their was not specifically about the black experience , but about all people rising above the powers that be .
