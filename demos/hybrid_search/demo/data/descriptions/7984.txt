McCartney describes this song as the daughter of Blackbird .
-LRB- thanks , Tommy - flower mound , TX -RRB- This song could be about a girl : when she is young likes to sing , but then as time goes on that spirit fades .
-LRB- thanks , tim - Houston , TX -RRB- In what could be a Pop music first , this song features a duduk solo .
A duduk is an Armenian wind instrument .
