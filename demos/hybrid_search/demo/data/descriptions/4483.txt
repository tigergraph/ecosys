Jez Williams -LRB- guitarist -RRB- told Drowned in Sound : `` The lyrics are inspired by a haunted house really .
The song itself though is us trying to write a classic garage rock song . ''
He added : `` I guess the main inspiration behind that song was rawness .
We actually wanted it to sound like it was recorded on a tape recorder , so that 's what we did !
We managed to get hold of this authentic 1970s tape recorder and the song was recorded entirely on that piece of equipment . ''
Williams concluded : `` To me its also reminiscent of heavier elements of Northern Soul .
R Dean Taylor 's ` There 's A Ghost In My House ' is one of my favourite songs of all time and to me it 's kind of our take on that . ''
Another inspiration for this song were the Nuggets and Pebbles compilation albums of 1960s garage and psychedelic rock that were put together by Jac Holzman , founder of Elektra Records , and Lenny Kaye , later lead guitarist for Patti Smith .
Andy Williams -LRB- drums -RRB- revealed to Drowned In Sound that this song `` almost did n't make the final selection on Kingdom of Rust .
It was that close to getting binned . ''
Jez Williams added : `` We literally stripped it bare , started again , then re-built it .
It was one of those we had to wrestle to the ground , literally beat the living daylights out of it ! ''
The Doves told the NME April 11 , 2009 : `` We mixed this through a 1970s East German tape recorder so it sounded crunched .
It 's full of attitude , it 's about your past haunting you . ''
