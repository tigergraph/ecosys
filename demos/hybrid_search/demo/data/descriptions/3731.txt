Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart wrote this for the movie Alfie , starring Jude Law as a Manhattan playboy confronted by the loneliness of his hedonistic lifestyle .
Stewart , who is famous for his work with Eurythmics , wrote in The Dave Stewart Songbook : `` The song reflects what was happening in Mick 's life , while also speaking perfectly to the way Alfie was feeling at that moment in the film .
Mick wrote these lyrics in the inner voice of Alfie , but also as a reflection of himself . ''
