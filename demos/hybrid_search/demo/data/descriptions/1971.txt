This trance track is a collaboration with Utah based Indie Rock band Neon Trees .
Tyler Glenn , the Neon Trees frontman , told Spinner the lyrics were inspired by his tendency towards introspection .
`` When I wrote it , I recalled nights I 've had at shows where all I want to do is hide in the dark of the clubs , '' he said .
`` That feeling , mixed with the theme that life is a series of missteps and grand successes , and we should all learn from every one of those moments , is the essence of ` Lessons in Love . ' ''
Neon Trees recorded their own New Wave-inspired take on the track for their 2012 album , Picture Show .
`` Kaskade 's remixed version was so big and abrasive , in a wonderful way .
We needed to keep that sultry dark cool to it , '' Glenn commented to Spinner .
The lessons that Kaskade and Neon Trees gives us in love are entirely different to ones Level 42 taught on their 1987 hit single .
