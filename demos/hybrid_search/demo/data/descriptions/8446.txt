Marsha Ambrosius is a former member of the English hip hop/soul duo Floetry , who had a # 24 Hot 100 in 2002 with `` Say Yes . ''
After the pair went their separate ways Marsha signed to J Records and released this song as her debut solo single on August 17 , 2010 .
Written and produced by Marsha and Canei , the song is , as Marsha describes , `` the reality of a bad break up .
We wan na be decent human beings and say the right thing , you know , ' I wish you well . '
But this is ` Everything that could go wrong for him I want it to because my ego is bruised and I 'm acting out . ''
