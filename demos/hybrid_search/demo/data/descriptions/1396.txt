A demo of this song originally surfaced in the summer of 2011 , but since then a mid - '90s Hip-Hop beat has been added , courtesy of veteran Hip-Hop producers Jeff Bhasker , the man behind much of Kanye West 's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Kid Cudi collaborator Emile Haynie .
Del Rey told Q magazine she writes in two ways - `` Walking around New York , singing words and melodies into my phone ... '' and with a producer `` helping put my words to music . ''
The song finds Lana in love again , `` Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City / Never was there ever a girl so pretty / Do you think we 'll be in love forever ?
, '' she sings .
However , her bad boy boyfriend is not suitable for her and she admits , `` you 're not good for me , but baby I want you . ''
Del Rey penned the song with one time Whiskeytown multi-instrumentalist Mike Daly .
Whiskeytown was an alternative country band who was fronted by Ryan Adams before his successful solo career .
They released three albums between 1995 and 2001 .
Daly went on to become a successful songwriter/producer .
His songs have been recorded by such artists as Sister Hazel -LRB- `` Take a Bow '' -RRB- and The Plain White T 's -LRB- `` Our Time Now '' -RRB- .
