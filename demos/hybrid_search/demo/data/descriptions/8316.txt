The lyrics of this goofy thrash number present a 17-year-old girl who , `` do n't wan na go steady '' because she 's `` probably not ready . ''
The female in question is model , Amanda Norgaard , whom Vaccines lyricist and vocalist Justin Young has only met once .
He told the NME : `` She was beautiful but she kissed my friend .
It did n't affect me as much as the song might suggest it did but I thought it would an interesting experiment to write a song about something that was n't beating me up .
I 'd only ever written about things I was obsessing over , it made a nice change and came pretty easy . ''
This was released as the fifth single from What Did You Expect from the Vaccines ?
and Amanda Norgaard features in the song 's music video .
NÃ¸rgaard is a Danish model , and Young disclosed to Q magazine that he wrote the song after a disastrous double date with the Dane .
`` This other girl and my friend ... who got off with the pair of them , '' he sighed .
`` I usually can only write when I 'm agitated about something . ''
