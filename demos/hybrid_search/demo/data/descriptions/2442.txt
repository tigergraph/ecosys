Flogging Molly singer Dave King explained this song to Alternative Press magazine : `` Sometimes you do n't get the chance to say goodbye to someone who has passed on .
My father died when I was ten , and I never had the opportunity to say goodbye to him .
It 's a song about being in a relationship with my wife , Bridget , that I 'm really , really happy in .
And a lot of the album is about losing one 's job , but we hope that we always have somebody that we can honestly say we love .
Sometimes that can get you through . ''
