This is a track from the self-titled debut solo album by producer and TV on the Radio guitarist Dave Sitek , which he recorded under the name of Maximum Balloon .
This song features Katrina Ford .
Sitek told The Guardian September 15 , 2010 : `` Katrina is in the band Celebration and she 's sung on a bunch of TV On the Radio records too .
To all intents and purposes , she 's my sister , so I drag her into almost everything I do .
And , of course , I absolutely love her voice -- it 's distinct and expansive -- so I 'm really lucky I can boss her around .
We bully each other into s -- t all the time .
In this case it was , ` You made me eat eggplant , so I 'm going to make you do this song ' .
We were hanging out at my studio in LA , cooking food , shooting BB guns and riding scooters , and the song evolved over a couple of days . ''
Sitek discussed his song writing for the project with The Guardian : `` I moved to LA after my landlord in Brooklyn tripled my rent .
I spent months looking for other places to move to in New York , then one day I was in California eating a grapefruit and I was like , ` This is what they taste like ? '
So I decided to move to LA and build a studio in my house .
I 've economised my whole operation -- I got rid of the mixing board and I have n't miked a guitar amp since the Bush administration .
I just have a small space packed with synthesisers .
Being in LA has definitely given me the opportunity to experience how my music sounds in real life because I can drive around and listen to the mixes , which I could n't do in New York .
I get to feel how a song works in combination with a sunset and a drive through the mountains .
That pushes me for more clarity , and to make music that sounds good with the windows down . ''
