This is the title track of the second studio album by Country music artist Justin Moore .
The singer explained to the radio station WSOC in Charlotte why he named the record after this song : `` Everybody battles that internal good versus evil from time to time while growing up .
I 'm a Christian but I have n't always been the best one or the best husband and dad .
This song talks about getting back to that place where I am better .
It has been a blessing in my life and that 's why we named the album after this song . ''
Moore told The Boot that this is probably the favorite song he 's ever written .
`` I 've had the title four or five years , '' he said , `` and my producer -LSB- Jeremy Stover -RSB- and I kept going over it and over it , but we could n't figure out how to write it .
Then finally , one morning , we were like , ` We really need to write this song ! '
It 's one of the songs that are very special , and as a songwriter , those do n't come around very often . ''
