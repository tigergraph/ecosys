Luscious Jackson was an all-female alternative funk band which made 4 albums in the 1990s .
This was the most successful of the songs they produced .
It 's best rembered for its stylish video , in which all 4 members of the band -LRB- Jill Cunniff , Gabrielle Glaser , Kate Schellenbach and Vivian Trimble -RRB- portray the same character , a woman being escorted to a departing airplane by her boyfriend .
Though the video looks like it takes place at an airport , it was actually filmed at the World Trade Center .
According to frontwoman Jill Cunniff , the video for this song was inspired by the Luis Buniel film That Obscure Object of Desire , which featured two actresses playing the same role .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA , for above 2 -RRB-
