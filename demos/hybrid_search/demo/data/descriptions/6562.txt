This song is about teenage pregnancy .
The opening lyrics : '' Babies born on a bathroom floor , mother prays it would never cry .
What 's wrong - you got your prom dress on when they ask you say it is n't mine , '' shows that it is singing through the eyes of the parents finding out about it .
-LRB- thanks , Tom - London , England -RRB- Nickelback took some heat for the intro to this song , which sounds very similar to the Metallica riff from `` The Unnamed Feeling , '' which was released a few months earlier .
-LRB- thanks , JT - Tullahoma , TN -RRB-
