The biggest hit of Loretta Lynn 's career to this point , `` You Ai n't Woman Enough '' went to # 2 on the Country charts and the album hit # 1 .
Written by Lynn , it shows her strong side , as she stands up for her man .
Lynn has explained that her husband Doolittle , who died in 1996 , was an influence in all of her songs , including her next single `` Do n't Come Home A ' Drinkin ' -LRB- With Lovin ' on Your Mind -RRB- , '' which shows the side of him that is n't worth fighting for .
Donna Jean Godchaux often performs this song and sang it on stage when she was a vocalist with The Grateful Dead .
Another popular cover is by the husband and wife duo Joey + Rory , who released it as a download in 2010 .
When we spoke with Joey Feek of Joey + Rory , she told us : `` I did n't know a lot of Loretta 's story until later in my young adult life , and then watching Coal Miner 's Daughter and reading the book .
Just the strength that she had - she just said what she thought , and she did n't have anything to hold back .
There were parts of it that I just loved , because she was innocent .
And on ` You Ai n't Woman Enough , ' Loretta was raising that flag about supporting her man and standing beside him and fighting for him and everything else .
She held that flag way before any other female country artist did .
And then we have a song like ` Cheater , ' and there 's some parallels there .
I just love Loretta .
You just ca n't help but love her , and you hear her talk and she 's honest with every word that she says .
She does n't hide a thing . ''
