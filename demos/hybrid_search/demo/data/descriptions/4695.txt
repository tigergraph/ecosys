Guitarist and chief songwriter Serge Pizzorno explained this song to the NME June 13 , 2009 : `` This has a real ` opium-chasers ' feel .
It 's about this mad expedition to Cairo in the 19th century , lots of mystical weird stuff fizzing around . ''
The song ends with an orchestral arrangement .
Pizzorno told the NME that it contains a sample of German violinist Helmut Zacharias playing the traditional Japanese folk song `` Sakura Sakura . ''
He added : `` I 've always had in mind to use it . ''
