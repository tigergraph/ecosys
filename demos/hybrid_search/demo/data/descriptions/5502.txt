Flogging Molly frontman Dave King explained to Alternative Press magazine why he got his wife Bridget Regan to sing this tune : `` I wrote that song in about 15 minutes .
I was playing it , and I was really enjoying the words , and I thought it would be beautiful to hear a woman sing those lyrics .
And I thought I would love to hear my wife 's voice sing that .
She got in there .
Bridget 's not the kind of person that likes to be in the spotlight .
So for her to do something like that is a big step for her .
She started to open her mouth , and we all said , `` Holy s -- t ! ''
That is so Beautiful .
I always love having songs that have an edge and a beauty to them , as well .
`` He added : '' remember the first line , ` I 've been walking miles forever , through these footprints of my life/When I offered you my sadness , you took home with delight ' - it was like she takes my good and my bad , and she makes me very happy .
And I just wanted to celebrate that . ''
