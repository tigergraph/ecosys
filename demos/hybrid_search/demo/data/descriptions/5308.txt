Marlon Roudette was inspired to write this song by his grandma who passed away in 2011 .
He explained to The Sun : `` She was blind from the age of five .
She lost her sight in an east London hospital .
To see someone like that raise a family and be one of the most capable people was a huge lesson in life .
She passed away the same week I wrote ` The Loss ' and it 's dedicated to her .
She 's with me every day .
I feel her presence .
It 's quite a difficult one to sing live but a necessary one . ''
