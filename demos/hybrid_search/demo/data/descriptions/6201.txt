This the first single released from Unfinished , which is the fourth solo album by the New Kids on The Block lead singer Jordan Knight .
The song was written by Colby O'Donis , who is best known for his hit single , `` What You Got '' and for his work on the breakthrough Lady Gaga track `` Just Dance . ''
The song 's music video sees Jordan dancing in a club and pursuing a girl .
`` This video is all about getting caught up in the music , '' he told AOL .
`` Letting the beat and melody elevate you into a euphoric state .
That feeling you get when you forget about all your problems and headaches and you just let go . ''
Knight told Billboard magazine that he was thrilled to return to his up-tempo pop roots on this song .
Said the veteran heartthrob : `` There 's this idea that when you turn 40 , you automatically go to adult contemporary heaven , but I want to try and challenge that .
My heart has always been in more up-tempo music you can dance to . ''
