The first single from Ke $ ha 's sophomore album , Warrior , is a down-and-out dirty party anthem that was penned by the singer with Nate Ruess from Fun. , Dr. Luke , Benny Blanco and Cirkut .
Producer Blanco told Rolling Stone : `` It 's stomps and claps , and the chorus does n't really have any drums in it , basically .
The feeling is so good ... And then the verse just pops in , and it 's very unexpected and it pops into electronic .
So it 's rock , it 's big electronic breaks and drums . ''
The song premiered at radio and was made available at all digital providers on September 25 , 2012 .
Dr. Luke told MTV News about the writing of the tune .
`` This song was kind of one of the songs we were working with as we were doing the whole record , '' he said .
`` It was n't like , ` OK , let 's set out to do this . '
We first had a different chorus on it , and it was pretty good .
Then we did another one with Nate , and we liked the vibe of it better .
I felt like what he brought to it , his world mixed in with production was an interesting sound , all the guitars and stuff .
Ke $ ha had n't really done guitars before really in songs .
On her last record it was a strict no-guitar rule . ''
The song 's music video has an apocalyptic theme : `` Well it 's about me being a cult leader at the end of the world , '' Ke $ ha told UK radio station Capital FM .
`` And everybody else is kind of being scared and hiding .
And we are running around like wild people , making out with each other and taking over a small border town in Mexico .
And the federals are after us because we 're so wild !
`` Ke $ ha explained the reason for the clip 's concept in some behind the scenes footage from the video shoot .
`` I wanted to come across like a cult , '' said the singer , `` because I always say that me and my fans , and me and my family , and me and my friends ... we 're all like a cult of rabid , wild misfits , and I really wanted that to come across in this video . ''
Ke $ ha admitted that she originally had doubts about some of the lyrics .
She said on her website : `` I did have some concerns about the phrase ` die young ' in the chorus when we were writing the lyrics especially because so many of my fans are young and that 's one reason why I wrote so many versions of this song .
But the point of the song is the importance of living every day to the fullest and staying young at heart , and these are things I truly believe . ''
Ke $ ha originally previewed the tune using a viral video clip featuring her bursting into song on the subway in Tokyo .
Regarding the song 's meaning , Ke $ ha told she told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio : `` It 's kind of an anthem .
It 's a celebration song , which I 'm obviously known for writing those , but this one , the concept of it was to live each and every single day like it 's your last and to always remain having a youthful spirit no matter how old I get . ''
The song was pulled off the airwaves after the shooting of 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Conn. .
Ke $ ha responded by saying , `` I 'm so so so sorry for anyone who has been effected by this tragedy , and I understand why my song is now inappropriate .
Words can not express . ''
