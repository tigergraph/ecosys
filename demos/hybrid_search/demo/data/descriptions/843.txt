Despite popular belief , this song is not a shot at the Emo genr√© of music , although Dave Grohl has stated how he despises emo music in interviews .
Dave Grohl : `` The title has nothing to do with the song - it 's placed right in the middle of the record , where there 's a lot of dark stuff .
It 's a pretty heavy record .
We have a couple bummer tunes I felt the album needed something to sit in the center and balance it .
So we had this lighthearted song , and I called it ` Cheer Up Boys -LRB- Your Make-Up Is Running -RRB- ' because it seemed like a little ray of hope in the middle of all this despair . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bert - Pueblo , NM , for above 2 -RRB-
