On this experimental noise assault , guitarist Thurston Moore name-drops the alias of the late L.A. punk icon Darby Crash of The Germs .
A number of reviewers have commented on the diversity within the songs on The Eternal , compared with the band 's previous few albums .
Moore told The Eternal : `` Our last few records were super-song-oriented .
With this one , I thought we should do more avant-garde rock & roll . ''
The band said of this in production notes : `` Flashing back to a wishful existence in the original Masque basement on N. Cherokee in Hollywood , crashing through lawns and garbage cans en route to the Canterbury/Disgraceland to jump up and down on beds with Helen Killer , Mary Rat and Trudi . ''
