Chris Carrabba -LRB- from Rolling Stone magazine -RRB- : `` It 's absolutely about war .
More specifically , it 's about a soldier coming home from war , trying to adjust .
The narrative is a conversation from son to father and father to son .
It 's a loosely fictitious tale , based on 2 friends of mine and a third person , whose story I saw on 60 Minutes - the soldier was wearing a Dashboard shirt .
I wrote Slow Decay about the horrors of war that we , as a nation , seem to be turning a deaf ear and blind eye to .
Many Vietnam vets are still maladjusted because they were n't reintegrated into society , so this will be a hot-button issue for the next 20 years .
It 's not the typical anti = war song , but I think it 's a necessary one . ''
