Monsters of Folk are an indie supergroup comprising Jim James of My Morning Jacket , Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis of Bright Eyes , and indie singer-songwriter M. Ward .
Mogis played steel guitar and mandolin on this track .
He explained to Express Night Out : `` Those songs -LSB- Jim -RSB- did n't consider an instrument and I played -LSB- steel guitar -RSB- and he was like , `` That 's great . ''
Mandolin - I do n't think he would have wanted me to play it there .
I said , `` Hey why do n't I play steel , '' and he said , `` Yea , that sounds great , '' is probably how that one went down . ''
