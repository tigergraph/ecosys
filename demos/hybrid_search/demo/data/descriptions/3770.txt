This song is about letting go of the past and allowing criticism to roll off your back - it makes no difference what others think .
This was Sum 41 's first single and their first video .
And yes , that is the rapper DMX in the clip .
The video was filmed in Toronto , where DMX was working on the movie Exit Wounds .
He crossed paths with the band and offered to make a guest appearance , which Sum 41 accepted .
