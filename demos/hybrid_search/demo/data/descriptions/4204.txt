Estelle is best known for `` American Boy , '' but to the English songstress ' annoyance the pop confection has pigeonholed her as a singer of upbeat , happy tunes .
`` I have to sing ` American Boy ' -LSB- darn -RSB- near every single day ! ''
Estelle said in her show at the Birchmere in Alexandria , Virginia on February 22 , 2012 .
`` Sometimes I get off stage and want to punch people . ''
The singer went on to say that she wrote this song , in which she sings about trying to find the simple pleasures of life during a difficult day , partly to help her appreciate her lot when she felt tired of performing her biggest hit .
