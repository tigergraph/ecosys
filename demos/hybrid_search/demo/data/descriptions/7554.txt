While guitarist Eric Lambert usually lays down the musical foundation for Blessthefall songs , singer Beau Bokan is responsible for nearly all of the band 's lyrics .
Bokan generally sticks to a straightforward , confessional style - lyrics that feel like they 're ripped from the pages of a diary .
This goes a long way to creating a powerful , direct emotional resonance with listener .
This effect is increased by Bokan 's professed habit of only writing things from real life .
None of his songs , he says , are stories or fictitious happenings ; they 're all ghosts from his past that he 's trying to wrestle out through music .
`` Stay Still '' is an especially personal song , even for Bokan .
The song was written about a friend of the singer 's who was killed in a plane crash .
The lyrics sound almost like an unsent letter written to the deceased friend , giving the listener the sense of hearing a final , one-sided conversation between two intimate friends .
`` Stay Still '' appears on 2009 's Witness , Blessthefall 's second album and its first with Beau Bokan as lead singer and songwriter .
Bokan has said he obsessively worked on perfecting and rewriting each song on the album so that fans of previous singer Craig Mabbitt would be convinced that he was a worthy replacement .
Witness saw the band tightening up their song structures and achieving a heavier sound .
Many critics hailed it as a bold step forward for the band , and Bokan 's performance as the new singer was widely praised .
While Bokan does not want the band to be pigeonholed into the Christian rock genre , he says that his faith plays a large part in his songwriting .
This is apparent in `` Stay Still '' by the line `` Oh Lord , do n't tell me this is happening '' - it 's repeated six times over the course of the song .
