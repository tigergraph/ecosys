The eerie , tribal outro of this song was recorded by songwriter and frontman Max Cavalera by the River Nile during a trip to Egypt .
He explained on his record label 's website : `` By the Nile River , there was this crazy gypsy band playing killer music .
I happened to have my recorder so I recorded them and made an interlude out of their performance .
It felt so authentic to have that outro - like old Sepultura .
I 'd rather the record sounds live than use a sound library from the Internet .
That outro is subtle .
I 've been making records for so long , and I finally found the perfect balance between brutality and experimentation . ''
Cavalera 's Egyptian trip was a major influence on Conquer .
The Soulfly frontman explained : `` We visited ` The City of the Dead ' while we were in Egypt .
It 's a cemetery where families still live near their dead .
That was crazy , creepy and wild .
I did n't know the Cairo trip was going to affect the album as much as it did . ''
