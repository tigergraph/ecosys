The lead single from Matt Cardle 's second studio album This Fire was penned by the singer with former B-Movie guitarist Paul Statham , who has also worked with Dido .
Statham co-wrote Dido 's breakthrough single in the UK , `` Here With Me '' , and also the title track of her 2001 album No Angel .
Discussing the song in a video track-by-track , Cardle said : `` It came about right at the end of the writing process .
It came alive without us realising what was going on .
We were just there having fun and I think it really works .
`` He added : `` I ended up referencing Frank Sinatra ... and Amy Winehouse ` Love Is a Losing Game ' - ` It 's a losing game that I wo n't play ' .
All these things were insinuating it was love that I was talking about rather than laying it out so blatantly . ''
Said Cardle regarding penning the song : `` When I started writing the track with Paul , we immediately started to feel a bit of an '80s vibe , so we just ran with it !
Big vocals , big drums ... it was great fun to write . ''
