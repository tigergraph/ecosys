This song was inspired by the 2001 David Lynch American psychological thriller Mulholland Drive .
Vocalist and songwriter Brian Fallon told Artist Direct : `` I watched that movie for the first time when I was writing the record .
I was watching it , and I was like , ' I went through something similar . '
It was n't in the same form exactly , but the sentiment was there .
It was a great title , so I wanted to use it . ''
Fallon told NME how Mulholland Drive inspired this song .
`` You do n't know if the characters in the movie are dead or the roles are reversed or who 's who , '' he explained , `` and I remember feeling like that in this one particular relationship that I had where I was , ' I do n't know where my head 's at here . ' ''
