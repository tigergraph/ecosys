Modest Mouse singer/songwriter Isaac Brock seems to hate this song .
When asked to play it at an Ugly Casanova -LRB- another band he has a hand in -RRB- concert , he responded , `` I would n't play that , even for the band it was written for . ''
The song is about fistfights .
In the old days , you could challenge someone to a fight by telling them to `` Put up your dukes . ''
-LRB- thanks , Andrew - Abyss , PA , for above 2 -RRB-
