This song tells the story about the death of a boy named Steven .
It 's not exactly clear what he died of , but the lyrics , `` November 10th , a cold dark night , you could tell that something was n't right '' are probably an allusion to suicide or an accident .
The song tells of everyone 's loss -LRB- `` A Friend lost a friend , a Brother lost a brother , A mother lost a son '' -RRB- but hints that he 's never truly gone .
-LRB- thanks , Nina Hikari - Nowhere , MO -RRB-
