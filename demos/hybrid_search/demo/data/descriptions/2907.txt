This samples The Eurythmics ' 1983 hit `` Sweet Dreams -LRB- Are Made Of This -RRB- '' and Linda Clifford 's `` Never Gon na Stop . ''
A re-mixed version featuring R. Kelly and including samples from the Isley Brothers ' `` Choosey Lover '' was later released as a single .
Nas explained to Rolling Stone magazine : `` That was mostly the label who reached for that one , so I 'll just leave it at that .
I think maybe I was the first rapper from New York to rap with R. Kelly .
I used to call him the R&B thug , and we used to see who had the most chains every night when I went on tour with him .
There 's some history there , so we just threw that on there . ''
