This is a track from Black Country , the debut album by Black Country Communion .
They are an Anglo/American rock group featuring vocalist/bassist Glenn Hughes -LRB- Deep Purple , Black Sabbath , Trapeze -RRB- , drummer Jason Bonham -LRB- Led Zeppelin -RRB- , keyboardist Derek Sherinian -LRB- Dream Theater -RRB- and blues rock guitarist Joe Bonamassa .
This song was originally recorded by Hughes ' band Trapeze in 1970 .
He explained to Norway 's Metal Express Radio why BCC decided to rework the track for Black Country .
`` It 's very simple really .
Joe loves the track , Jason 's father John , played that track twenty times with me back in 1970 on tour with Trapeze .
John and I used to hang out a lot back in those days and he used to drive me to gigs .
Now I 'm playing this song nearly 40 years later with his son so it 's special .
It 's a beautiful thing and Jason Bonham plays it insanely brilliantly .
I 've now played that song with both Bonhams , it 's crazy . ''
