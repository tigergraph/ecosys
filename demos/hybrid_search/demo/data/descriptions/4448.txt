In this song , Cole sings about the powerful feelings she still has for the man who used to be her boyfriend .
She tries to figure out what she did wrong , and keeps thinking about what it was like to fall in love with him .
At a Malibu restaurant , Cole spotted an old flame dining with his girlfriend .
They had dated a few years previously but things did n't develop as the R&B singer had wished as he was n't interested in a committed relationship .
Cole explained on her record 's label 's website what happened next : `` So I was looking at the girl and I was like , ` What is it about her ?
You know , like seriously , what are you thinking ? '
And I just wrote about it , it came out really quick .
After I wrote the song , I went to the studio about 4 in the morning , and by 5 or 6 I was done with the song and that 's what you hear . ''
In an interview with Blender magazine , Cole explained that she got the idea for this song when she was at a Malibu nightclub .
Said Cole : `` I just wrote the song in a corner while everyone else was partying .
Love had n't been treating me too good . ''
