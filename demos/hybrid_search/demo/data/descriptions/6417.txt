Bass and organ player Rhys Webb told NME of this song with lyrics built around the title : `` It started life as a chunky piano-led rocker .
I think it 's going to be great live - it does n't really sound like anything on the first two albums but very much reminds me of the energy of the early Horrors sound .
Maybe it 's the organ ! ''
