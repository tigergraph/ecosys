Leslie wrote and produced Cassie 's 2006 hit single `` Me & U. '' Leslie told MTV News that this song reflects his addiction to music .
He explained : '' ` Addiction ' came about one night after I 'd gone to several different spots in New York City .
One night after doing that , that energy and excitement was in me , and instead of going home , I went straight to the studio , man .
I do n't drink or smoke , so the way that I creatively express myself is to get right in the studio .
I wanted to create a track that captured that frenetic energy and electricity that I had experienced that night . ''
