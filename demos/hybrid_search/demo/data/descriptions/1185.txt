Drummer Ryan Richards -LRB- from Rock Sound magazine -RRB- : `` This is another first for us - being that the song was written and performed on a seven string guitar using a tuning we 'd never used before .
You can really hear that come through in the riffs .
I think using different tuning and instrumentation allowed us to recapture that classic FFAF sound but offer a fresh take on it .
It 's definitely got that trademark sound , but in a new and different way - which is pretty exciting for us and our fans . ''
