Buckcherry lead singer Josh Todd told Q magazine : `` There was a point in my life that was really dark .
A lot of things were colliding at one time : my personal life , a band situation , the inner dealings , I had that feeling like does n't anyone understand that we 're just trying to do something real here ?
I wanted to pave the way for something new and wonderful , and I felt really lonely . ''
