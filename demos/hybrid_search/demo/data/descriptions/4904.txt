Neil Peart wrote the words with Pye DuBois .
It 's about waiting , watching and listening for a reply .
Peart : `` I was up in Yellowknife last June on a motorcycle trip across the country , and there 's one of those Inukashuk above the town overlooking it , and I was quite taken with it .
I bought a postcard almost exactly the image you see on the cover ... I just came back with this postcard and I thought of `` test for echo . ''
I thought that 's exactly what these men mean when you 're out in the wilderness ... when you 've been hiking for a few days and you come across one of these things , it 's such an affirmation that there 's life out there .
Again the same thing : it 's an echo ... and that 's the feeling a traveler in the Arctic would get , that it was a sign of life .
The same with the satellite dishes .
I was kind of referring to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the test for echo going out that way . ''
