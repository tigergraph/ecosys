This is the first single by American singer Jesse McCartney from his fourth album .
The song was released through Digital Download on September 21 , 2010 .
The song 's sexy lyrics are about falling in love in a way that McCartney told MTV News can really mean anything you want them to .
`` It 's definitely open for interpretation , '' he said explaining why he chose to release this track .
`` I 'm really excited about ` Shake . '
We decided that would be the first single to represent Have It All and I felt like that song was kind of the closest to -LSB- 2008 's -RSB- Departure and it was a way to sort of reacquaint the fans with my music . ''
The song is about a girl who Jesse has won the heart of .
`` Everybody knows - I got the MASTER Key to that girls heart .
He just got a copy , '' tweeted McCartney after the song 's premiere .
McCartney told Just Jared that `` Shake , '' is `` a record I did with two writers who work under Dr. Luke 's camp and we wrote it in a matter of hours .
` Shake ' can mean whatever you want it to mean .
It 's a pretty loose term -LRB- laughs -RRB- . ''
