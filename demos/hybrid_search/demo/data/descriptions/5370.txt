Bassist Dave Ellefson commented to MusicRadar.com about his contribution to this song : `` This is some of my favorite kind of bass playing .
In a not very obvious way , it harkens back to a kind of punk-rock style of picking.I went at it with a lot of fervor and tried not to overthink what I was doing .
My main goal was to lock in with the drums .
It 's a blazing song .
Total attitude , lots of fun . ''
