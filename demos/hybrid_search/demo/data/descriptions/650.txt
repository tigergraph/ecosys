Bryan explained the background to this autobiographical song in a press release about National Hunting and Fishing Day .
He said : `` My mother 's father had a tackle box that , as a child , I would go through all the time .
It kind of taught me who he was as a person .
The song is about the wonderful times I had together with both of my grandfathers . ''
