This string-laden track marks a more playful sound for the xx .
DJ-producer Jamie Smith told Spin magazine regarding the origin of the tune : `` We were in a lull trying to work on something else and not getting anywhere so we just started playing this and by the end of the night we had a song .
`` Singer-guitarist Romy Madley Croft added : '' -LSB- The song -RSB- is quite a new thing for us .
It 's a bit of a different groove .
Oliver -LSB- Sim -RSB- plays quite a fun bass line . ''
The song likens the highs and lows of a relationship to that of the tides .
However , the pared-back lyrics are typical of Sim and Madley-Croft 's impersonal material .
`` I do n't want the details of our life to limit the imaginations of the people who listen to our music , '' said Sim to Spin .
Romy and I have been thinking a lot about someone like Sade .
Her music of course -- it 's so sensual -- but more the fact that you do n't know anything about her .
That to me is the height of cool .
Remaining mysterious like that .
It 's abnormal to know everything about anyone .
Maybe in the last few years , there 's been the expectation that we should know everything Katy Perry thinks and does , but in the span of human history , privacy is the norm .
That 's what people protect . ''
