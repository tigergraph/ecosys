Ed Kowalczyk is the former lead singer of the band Live .
Since the band disbanded in 2009 he has pursued a solo career , and this is a track from his debut album , Alive .
For this track , Kowalczyk worked with American Idol finalist Chris Daughtry , who became a friend after the pair performed together on the 2006 `` Idol '' finale .
Kowalczyk told Billboard magazine he had `` kind of wrapped up '' the song until he joined Daughtry on stage in Ventura , California , then invited him back to his house for dinner .
`` We started playing each other our ideas , '' Kowalczyk recalled , `` and I played a little of that song and he was like , ` Try this here , try this there ... ' It turned into this impromptu collaboration that I do n't think either of us expected , but it was really fun . ''
