Vocalist James Dean Bradfield told the NME May 16 , 2009 that this song `` deals with just hating those momentary lapses of just falling into narcissism and then realising perhaps that even the appreciation of yourself is just useless . ''
This song leads into the next track `` Pretension/Repulsion , '' which `` talks about the idealisation of beauty , or what is ugliness . ''
Bradfield told the NME that he loves the way that this song , `` deals with one issue and ` Pretension/Repulsion ' seems to resolve it for me . ''
