He tells a of a sexually-driven relationship between his 17-year-old self and a young seductress named Sherane .
Lamar recalled to Complex magazine : `` I was in Atlanta when Tha Bizness gave me the beat .
Immediately I got a vibe where I wanted to talk about a specific girl back when I was growing up .
A specific story that leads down the line into the album .
I got the track and I started writing and I went back home and laid it down . ''
`` These songs , they come naturally for me to write off the experiences I grew up with , '' Lamar continued , `` and the things I been around .
It was just what we were going through .
It 's easy for me to write -LSB- real -RSB- stories rather than making up a crazy story . ''
So how does Sherane feel about her depiction as Kendrick 's teenage crush ?
`` It 's funny because it 's a weird thing when I go back to the neighborhood and the homeys know who I 'm talking about .
It be a big joke , and I 've been hearing things that she 's more excited and surprised that I put her in the song more than anything , '' K-Dot told MTV News .
`` That 's the funny part about it .
It 's all love though .
I ai n't got no ill will . ''
Sherane pops up again on the track `` Poetic Justice '' when Lamar digs deeper into the electricity between them .
