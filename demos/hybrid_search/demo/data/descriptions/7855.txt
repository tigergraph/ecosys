This piano elegy was inspired by the death of an old friend in prison .
`` He was in a bad crowd , but he was like a big brother ; he always looked after me , '' Delilah told The Independent .
`` I remember I was in New York , working .
It was 3am and I was in the studio and I got a call from a friend of his saying he 'd been in a fight and probably was n't going to make it .
It was going to be his 21st birthday a few weeks later , and that set me off -- I had a beat left over from -LSB- our recording session -RSB- and I just started singing over the top of it .
It was all done in a few minutes -- it was the fastest song I 've ever written . ''
