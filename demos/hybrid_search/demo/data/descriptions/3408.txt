In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine , Perry said that this song and `` I 'm Still Breathing '' were about the same ex-boyfriend .
She added `` Ur So Gay '' and `` Mannequin '' were about different exes .
Perry told Inthenews.co.uk that this song gets the best response at her live shows and it even reduces some fans to tears .
She explained : `` People do get emotional when they hear that song , because I think a lot of people go through that stuff so it hits them where they remember it happening to them .
And it 's just me with my guitar , rather than all the pyro and the dancers and the glitter , and I enjoy taking advantage of that , but sometimes it 's nice to be able to take all that away and just do what I was put here to do . ''
In her London Live special , Perry said that this was a very personal song .
`` When I was starting out at these open mic nights , it was just me and my acoustic guitar , and that 's how I wrote the song , '' she said .
`` It shows off that side , it 's not an in-the-club throbbing song .
I feel like I need that organic , homegrown musicianship to feel like I have substance to go with the bells and whistles . ''
This acoustic ode was produced by Butch Walker -LRB- `` Fall For You '' , `` When You 're Gone '' -RRB- .
When this reached the Top 40 of the Hot 100 , Perry became the first female artist signed to Capitol Records to have three top 40 hits from an album since Bonnie Raitt 's Lick of the Draw in 1991-1992 .
