This rollicking rocker finds Case taking on the subject of gender roles : `` I 'm a man 's man , I 've always been .
But make no mistake what I 've invested in .
The woman 's heart is the watermark by which I measure everything . ''
Case told The Guardian : `` I think I just want balance .
I want to be equal parts man and woman , no matter what I am at the gynecologist . ''
The song grew out of Case 's observations about the inflexible way people often respond when she refers to herself as a guy -- as in , `` I 'm the kind of guy who ... '' She told Rolling Stone : `` Everybody wants to remind you that you 're a girl .
And I 'm like , not if I do n't want to be .
I grew up in America , man . ''
Case added that the song is also an attack on modern politically correct attitudes .
`` The Seventies went out of its way to show little girls as firemen and stuff , '' she said .
`` Let 's not hash it out and make it firewoman or fireperson . ''
That 's M. Ward of She & Him playing the fuzzed-out guitar .
