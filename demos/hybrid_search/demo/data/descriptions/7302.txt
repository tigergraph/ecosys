Tunstall closes Invisible Empire/Crescent Moon with this surging acoustic number that builds up to a belting , Country-Psych rocker .
It acts as a cathartic outburst of emotion after the melancholic mood of much of the album .
`` I really wanted something that took you out at the end , and woke you up from this spell , if you like , '' Tunstall explained .
`` Because I found that anything uptempo I was trying to fit into the tracklisting burst the bubble .
And I wanted to stay within that .
So ` No Better Shoulder ' is the way out at the end . ''
