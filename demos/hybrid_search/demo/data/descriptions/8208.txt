Guitarist Benji Madden explained this song 's meaning in an interview with Alternative Press : `` It 's no secret that we 're proud to be from Maryland .
This song is the realization that things change , but we 're still the same boys no matter how far we go from home .
Our hearts are always there .
It 's a love story for Maryland . ''
