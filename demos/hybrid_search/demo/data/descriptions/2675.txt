Right before the recording of Circuital , frontman Jim James had LASIK laser-eye surgery and the experience partially inspired this song .
He explained to UK newspaper The Sun : `` It was a supremely life-changing and psychedelic experience for me .
I 've worn glasses since I was a wee babe and to have my eyeballs sliced open and shot through with laser beams was unreal .
It really made me focus on the concepts of clarity and victory ... how only clarity of mind and path can lead to eventual victory . ''
