This is the lead single from the band 's eighth album and reached # 10 on the Canadian Rock/Alternative Chart and # 30 on the US Mainstream Rock Chart .
In a 2013 interview with Linea Rock , Jones said that the album 's title is `` an old title that we had ... but we were never able to use it .
It 's just a statement on how , you know , rock 'n' roll today is n't really the most popular form of music anymore and it 's taken its fair share of hits . ''
In our 2013 interview with singer and guitarist Danko Jones -LRB- like Alice Cooper , the band and lead singer have the same name -RRB- , he said : `` The song is very lyrically misleading .
It 's about how I do n't like sunny days , I do n't like what people consider beautiful days .
I was staring outside of the window watching the first good day of the year where the weather was good , especially up in Canada .
People were walking around in shorts and T-shirts , and it annoyed me .
So I just wrote this song , very Funkadelic influenced .
The name of the Funkadelic song I think was ` Red Hot Mama , ' but just the way the verses are , that 's what started the riff .
And then after that , I wanted it to sound like it 's an ode to the sunshine and the beautiful day , and everybody loves a beautiful day .
But really it 's not .
It was about how I like staying inside and I like it when the sun goes down and I like it when it 's overcast .
But I did n't really explain it very well in the song .
I should have , I guess .
But anyways , that 's what that song 's about .
And that 's how it came about . ''
