Harris told The Independent on Sunday August 2 , 2009 that having read the brief of Gremlin-type creatures grooving to a song called `` Yeah Yeah Yeah , La La La , '' he decided that an artist such as Prince or Parliament would have such a title .
`` So that 's the kind of tune I did . ''
Harris added : `` It was a nice opportunity to get a song played all round different countries .
The first album was a disaster in most countries other than the UK .
It was kinda the label 's fault -- I know it 's easy to blame them -- but it took quite a long time to come out , and by that time I was already in my purple room in Glasgow . ''
