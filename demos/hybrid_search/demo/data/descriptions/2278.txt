According to various reports MacDonald wrote this song after watching a documentary about Jamie Bulger , the two-year-old child who was abducted , tortured and murdered by two 10-year-old boys in 1993 .
The song is Jamie talking to his parents telling them he is OK.However , in an interview with Digital Spy , MacDonald denied `` Spark '' is about the toddler 's death .
She said : `` No , it 's not .
That 's a made up story from The Sun - what I said was completely taken out of context .
When I read what The Sun had written , it totally shocked me because I 'd never really been the victim of that kind of thing before .
It made me feel really terrible because I thought people might get upset by what they thought I 'd said .
`` She added : `` Thankfully , the person who wrote it apologised to me .
I 'm probably one of the only people in the world who can say they 've had a Sun journalist apologise to them for writing nonsense ! ''
