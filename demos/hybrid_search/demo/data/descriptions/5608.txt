This is the second single by Canadian R&B / soul singer Melanie Fiona , off her sophomore album The MF Life .
Written by Rico Love , the sultry cut finds Fiona singing of the heartbreak that comes from dating an adulterous man .
The song was sent to urban stations on August 30 , 2011 .
During an interview with The Boombox , Rico Love compared this song with -LSB- Mary J. Blige 's -RSB- ` Mr. Wrong , ' explaining that both `` kinda autobiographical for me . ''
He went on to explain that , `` I 'm just describing what I 've heard women in my life say to me . ''
The MF Life takes its inspiration from different aspects of love .
`` If I could call it something it would be ` stadium soul , ' '' Fiona told Billboard magazine : `` The songs are just bigger .
When I say soul I mean , it 's the soul of the emotion that comes from within .
It is everything that I 've experienced and the emotions I 've had to challenge .
It 's a lot of reflection on love .
And I feel like every song , even though in different areas are about love , that they embody different moods and different reflections on love . ''
