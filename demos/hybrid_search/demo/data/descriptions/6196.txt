`` All the people are like , ' I do n't know what it is , but every time I hear the song , I just wan na do it , ' '' James told MTV News about the drug .
`` That 's a terrible excuse , but go ` head , get high , go ` head .
Blame Trinidad , blame it on me . ''

`` I did everything A-Town just to show people that I love where I come from .
I still do , '' he told MTV News .
`` That 's why I had to start off the year right , why not do the remix with ATL legends ? ''
