Both this Long Beach , California-based indie pop band and its frontman go under the guise of Avi Buffalo .
The singer-guitarist , real name Avigdor Zahner-Isenberg , is joined by keyboardist Rebecca Coleman , bassist Arin Fazio and drummer Sheridan Riley .
This is the first single from Avi Buffalo 's self-titled debut album , which was released on April 27 , 2010 .
Zahner-Isenberg told BBC DJ Steve Lamacq about the song on his Radio 2 show .
He said : `` This song I wrote a couple of years ago now .
At the time I 'd been listening to a band called Beechwood Sparks and the Beach Boys and I was sitting in a friend 's living room playing an acoustic guitar doing the chords and sing and we just put it together a very simple verse chorus song .
The themes are ... I do n't know , moods and stuff and adolescent things . ''
