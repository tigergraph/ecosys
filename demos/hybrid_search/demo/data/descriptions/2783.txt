This is a track from the South African sibling Rock quartet Kongos ' second album , Lunatic .
The CD 's title came from this song .
Bassist Dylan Kongos explained to Artist Direct : `` We really liked the sound of the word .
We went through so many names .
This was actually the difficult part of the process .
It somewhat relates to the song ` I 'm Only Joking ' if you look into the lyrics .
There 's a reference to ` lunatics . '
It stuck with us .
After going back and forth with a number of names , we chose that one .
It just sounded right to us . ''
The song topped various South African charts including all three of Tuks FM 's listings .
