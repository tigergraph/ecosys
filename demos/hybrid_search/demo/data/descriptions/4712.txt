This song was inspired by the film adaptation of Joseph Heller 's novel , Catch-22 and features dialogue from one of the movie 's central scenes , where Art Garfunkel 's character argues with an Italian solider about America 's military importance .
Frontman Tim McIlrath explained to Spin magazine : `` Garfunkel says to him , ` How can Italy be powerful when they were occupied by Nazi Germany ? '
and the soldier just sort of laughs at his stupidity and tells him , ` Well , we 're still here -- where are those people who occupied us ?
They lost . '
It 's this interesting anti-war statement and you can just see it blowing the soldier 's mind . ''
