This song was written by Bo Diddley , but he published it under the name of his wife , Ethel Smith , due to a legal dispute with his record company .
His version can be found on I 'm a Man : The Chess Masters , 1955-1958 .
The song is about the complexities of love - how it can be addictive and lead to madness .
This was the only hit for Mickey and Sylvia , but Sylvia had a # 3 US hit in 1973 with `` Pillow Talk , '' where she effectively simulates an orgasm .
More significantly , she started Sugarhill Records and put together The Sugarhill Gang , who had the breakthrough Hip-Hop hit `` Rapper 's Delight . ''
Peaches & Herb took this song to # 13 in the US in 1967 .
Other artists to record the song include Sonny And Cher , Everything But The Girl , Buck Owens and Susan Raye , Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton , Paul McCartney , Betty Everett , and Connie Francis .
Mickey & Sylvia are McHouston `` Mickey '' Baker and Sylvia Robinson -LRB- at the time , she was Sylvia Vanderpool -RRB- .
Their version was a drastically different take on the song , turning Bo Diddley 's call-and-response portion into a conversation between Mickey and Sylvia .
The spoken word portion of the song where Mickey asks , `` How do you call your loverboy ? ''
and Sylvia responds , `` Hey , Loverboy , '' made the song quite memorable and was especially racy for the time .
The coy sexuality of this portion helped advance the stoylines of several famous movies , including the 1972 adult film Deep Throat , the 1973 movie Badlands , and the 1987 movie Dirty Dancing , where the main characters played by Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey mimed the song to each other .
Buddy Holly released his version of this song in June , 1957 as `` Words Of Love . ''
It did n't chart , but his next single was `` Peggy Sue , '' which became his first hit .
In the UK , The Everly Brothers 1965 version hit # 11 .
