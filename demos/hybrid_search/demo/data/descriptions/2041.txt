John Lennon wrote this and also sang lead .
He considered it one of his best early songs John Lennon wrote this on a plane while The Beatles were touring with Jackie DeShannon .
It was a songwriting departure from the lighter fare Lennon and McCartney previously wrote .
Lennon : `` Me in my Dylan period ... part of me suspects I 'm a loser and part of me thinks I 'm God almighty . ''
John Lennon 's lowest recorded note as a Beatle is a G , which he hits in this song .
He also sings the G in the last `` going down '' of `` Happiness Is A Warm Gun . ''
