This is a rather despondent song , where the singer feels he ca n't escape .
Lead singer Scott Weiland has revealed that many of his lyrics were inspired by his battles with drug addiction and his personal demons.A song about feeling that there 's no escape titled `` No Way Out '' would have been very much the thoughts of lead man Scott Weiland , having just been through serving a year in jail on drug charges .
STP guitarist Dean DeLeo -LRB- who was also this song 's co-writer -RRB- , in an interview while Weiland was incarcerated , stated that in all probability `` the judge saved his life . ''
Scott Weiland has also had recent struggles , and we now hear that he 's bipolar .
Be kind , folks , it is n't an easy affliction to live with.As recently as 2008 , Weiland has served short sentences for DUI .
Despite the personal troubles , the album No. 4 still managed to get certified RIAA platinum - with no tour to promote it !
MTV banned the first video the group submitted due to excessive nudity .
It had to be re-edited .
The video was made by having 400 radio station contest winners videotape a private concert of the band performing this .
Footage from the tapes was edited together to form the video .
The band wanted their fans to make their video because they were fed-up with the state of music videos , which they felt were shallow and formulaic .
