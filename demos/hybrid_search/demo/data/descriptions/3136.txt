After converting to the Muslim faith in 1978 , the famous singer-songwriter Cat Stevens sold his guitars , changed his name to Yusuf Islam and stopped recording .
In 1985 he was invited by Bob Geldof to play at Live Aid , an offer he felt he could n't refuse .
He penned this song for the occasion , which was to be sung solo/a cappella .
However , a combination of Elton John running over time and Harvey Goldsmith and Bob Geldof being sceptical about the song prevented him going on .
When Islam finally decided to make a comeback in 2006 , he included this song on An Other Cup , his first Western pop album since 1978 's Back to Earth .
According to Yusuf Islam , in the song he is asking people to look at themselves and check that they 're making the right choices because they 'll be judged - in the end .
