The Fray 's principle songwriters , singer Isaac Slade and guitarist Joe King penned this song between them .
Slade 's contribution concerns his `` split personality '' and a full-on personal breakdown that he had in the summer of 2009 .
He explained to Denver Westword : `` It 's not really split left and right ; it 's more split outside and inside .
I spent 27 years of my life caught between people-pleaser-Mr .
- Christian-nice-guy and scared , alone , insecure kid inside that was kind of starving to death .
A couple things sort of cracked the shell , but it was experiencing anger for the first time in my personal life and admitting that I tried a tactic of making everybody happy and admitting that it had failed miserably .
And I sacrificed so much to try , and I was just done with it , dying inside . ''
King 's contribution was about his first experiences of dating after his divorce .
He explained to Denver Westword : `` When you 're only in one relationship all your life and that ends , you 're like learning how to do the littlest and the simplest things .
I remember the first couple dates I went on , I would say things like so serious , and I 'd immediately freak them out because I was talking major big picture stuff and analyzing them as if they 're going to be my wife or not.It was way to overboard and heavy .
I just remember early on coming back to the house and writing a few lyrics .
That paralyzing thing struck me , maybe because I was freaked out about what I was doing .
But I 'd like to think I was passionately taken by a woman .
I think it was more just like , `` Okay , I do n't know what I 'm doing here , '' and I 'm just freaked out . ''
