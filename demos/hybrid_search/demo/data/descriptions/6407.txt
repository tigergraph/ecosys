This song is about a girl who is hard to get rid of .
Getting through to her that she 's not wanted is like getting through crosstown traffic .
This song includes a famous kazoo riff , which Hendrix originally performed using a comb and a piece of cellophane .
Instead of using sounds of car horns like the Lovin ' Spoonful did on `` Summer In The City , '' the kazoo simulated the traffic nicely .
-LRB- thanks , Lee - Buckley , Wales , for above 2 -RRB- Chas Chandler produced the original tracks , but Hendrix remixed them when he started producing his own music in 1968 .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- The lyrics are similar to many Blues songs in that they are filled with sexual references in clever metaphors : `` I 'm not the only soul , who 's accused of hit and run , tire tracks all across your back , I can see you 've had your fun . ''
Dave Mason from the group Traffic sang on this .
That 's him singing the high part on the word `` Traffic . ''
