The first single from Dirty Projectors ' sixth album , Swing Lo Magellan , finds frontman Dave Longstreth singing about the powerless population .
`` But now the banks are closed , '' he croons .
`` And nothing gets bigger .
The crowd will yell but the gun has no trigger . ''
He told The Guardian the song is `` an oblique portrait of America . ''
The song was released on March 30 , 2012 .
Longstreth discussed the tune 's meaning with Tonedeaf.com describing it as `` an abstract and metaphorical song . ''
`` When I wrote the lyrics I was n't sure what they were about , '' he explained .
`` And the recorded performance on this song was the first time I was singing the song , saying the lyrics .
Some of the words are not even real words or mispronounced because I did n't entirely know them .
The song is about the nature of protesting , and what a protest could be in a world in which protesting just becomes a spectacle of protest .
Which affirms the notion that we 're facing a larger morass where we are protesting against this circular system , and it 's impossible to imagine an alternative .
The song is about a frustration - where it 's even impossible to commit suicide .
You hold a gun but it does n't have a trigger .
You ca n't actually kill yourself with the gun , you can only flash it around . ''
