Will Young told The Sun September 26 , 2008 that this song was a struggle to write .
He explained : `` Grace took nine months to do .
A friend and I were talking about something , and said ` Oh that person has no grace at all ' .
That word says so much about someone and I liked the idea of someone in the song getting their come-uppance . ''
This song 's dark sentiments are counterbalanced by the uplifting `` ooh-ooh '' hook line .
Young explained on his record label 's website : `` That hook came from nowhere .
The best ones do .
A lot of songs have been done around the piano .
I used to like to get a groove going to get a sense of the story , what the mood was .
This time it 's been a lot more about the chords , finding proper musical movement . ''
Will Young said on his record label 's website : `` I think grace and charm are important qualities , they go with generosity , but it 's about someone who has neither .
There 's a bit of personal hurt in that song . ''
