Guitarist Zach Blair told Ultimate-Guitar .
com how this song 's dark tone was created accidentally : `` On ` The Strength to Go On , ' Jason Livermore , the engineer , had n't killed the signal to one of the cabinets out in the control room .
And he had muted it in the room so we were listening to the track , but we were listening to the track so loud it was vibrating the strings of the guitar .
And so it was kinda doing this real low-end feedbacky kind of hum for the entire time and accidentally he printed it .
So , when we listened back to the song again , we kept hearing this in the background and it was perfect for the song .
It was more of a darker song ; I think the song was tuned to a dropped D and it totally worked for the song . ''
