Hereford born and raised Ellie Goulding learned to play the guitar and write her own folk-inspired music at the age of fifteen .
A few years later , she moved away from rural home to attend the University of Kent to study drama .
This was one of the first tunes she ever wrote , which Goulding told the NME is `` a song about leaving the countryside , which still pains me . ''
The American release of Lights features a couple of tracks that were n't on the original UK release of the set .
To make room for them , `` I 'll Hold My Breath '' and `` Wish I 'd Stayed , '' were omitted from the repacked album .
Goulding told Chart Rigger : `` It was kind of tough , but it was my decision .
I feel like I 've grown out of them slightly because I wrote them so long ago .
` Wish I 'd Stayed ' will always be very special to me because that was one of the very first songs I wrote , when I was just really free-writing .
I just prefer ` Animal ' and ` Human . '
They 're an example of how I 've progressed .
And the reason I kept them for the repackage and not the -LSB- next -RSB- album is because I think I 'm going to progress even more .
But those other two songs , I kind of felt like they were holding me back a bit and I wanted to have a fresh start in America , and be happy with the tracks . ''
After being exposed to electronic music , Goulding developed this song with the help of electropop artist and producer Frankmusik , whom she emailed via MySpace .
She explained to the Guardian December 12 , 2009 : `` I said , ` I 've got this acoustic song , and I know I want something good to happen to it but I do n't know what -- can you help me ? ''
Frankmusik replied instantly to her surprise .
`` He said , ` Yes , I 'd love to , come round on Monday . '
So I got a train to Thornton Heath , ended up staying for a week , recorded a couple of songs , and just talked about music . ''
