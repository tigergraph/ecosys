This was released as the first single off HIM 's eighth studio album , Tears on Tape .
The Finnish radio station Yle debuted the song on March 8 , 2013 .
The song 's music video was directed by Stefan Lindfors , who also directed the clips for HIM 's `` The Funeral Of Hearts '' and `` Tears on Tape . ''
The clip centers on the face of singer Ville Valo , as he and his bandmates perform the song in the dark of night .
We also see a collection of hooded women creating a heartagram , the group 's logo , which is a combination of a heart and a pentagram .
HIM frontman Ville Valo described the song to Noisecreep as : `` Roy Orbison meets David Lynch meets Iggy Pop on amphetamines . ''
He added : `` It has a punk edge that is not HIM , per se .
It is super melodic and super '60s , and that is very new to me and it is a sense of achievement to me . ''
