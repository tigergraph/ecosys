Miranda Lambert is best known by many for her songs about shooting guns -LRB- `` Gunpowder and Lead '' -RRB- and setting people 's houses on fire -LRB- `` Kerosene '' -RRB- .
She told Rolling Stone : `` I think I was getting close to being pigeonholed as the crazy girl who shoots guns and sets people 's houses on fire . ''
However on Revolution Lambert is stretching out with mature ballads such as this reflective number about settling down and finding love .
She commented : `` I feel I 'm a little more stable in life , and not the crazy , wild-eyed kid that was writing ` Kerosene ' at 18 .
I 've been through a lot and grown up a lot on the road .
And I 've always kind of been a little older than my age anyway .
I have a farm in Oklahoma , a place in Texas , I have a steady relationship , a good career going , and good people around me .
I was just driving home from the airport one night thinking about all those things , and thinking about how I bought a farm in Oklahoma -LSB- to be with -RSB- a boy .
Having someone that grounds you in your life is really priceless .
` Makin ' Plans ' is about having somebody that always is your foundation , and wherever they are is home . ''
Lambert told Billboard magazine that she did n't draw the album title from a song or a lyric ; instead Revolution signifies a change in perspective .
She explained : `` To me , that 's an exciting word , that something new is happening .
I sort of reinvented myself musically on this record .
It feels like there 's change , that country music is more open-minded .
To me , anyways . ''
