Kiwanuka and his producer Paul Butler of the UK indie rock band , The Bees , came up with about seven different versions of this song , before finally completing the track that appears on Home Again .
Said Kiwanuka to This is Fake DIY : `` While I had been in studios before , it was never for long , extended periods of time - only for two-song sessions recorded in one take .
So I was n't anything of an expert when it came to the technical side of things .
But I 'm really interested by the contrast of really sad blues songs that have this bouncy and happy rhythm to them .
So this song was my take on that aesthetic . ''
Kiwanuka has yet to have had his heart broken , so there 's little on Home Again concerning matters of the heart , only this whimsical lovecall in which Kiwanuka imagines what a good relationship would be like .
He told The Observer : `` I 've never been in love .
I do n't think I have .
That sounds harsh .
I 've been in love with friends and family ; I 've never been in love where you 'd do anything for the person , never had that feeling that if they left , like with Adele , you 'd be broken .
I 've been more single than not in my short life . ''
