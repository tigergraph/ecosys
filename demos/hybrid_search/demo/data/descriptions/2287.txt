Whilst writing The Offspring 's ninth album Days Go By , frontman Dexter Holland realized most of the material was heavy and a bit serious , so he decided he need a couple of tunes that were lighter and more fun .
`` Cruising California '' is one of them , and the song was released as the first single off the record worldwide -LRB- except for the United States , Canada , Germany , Austria and Switzerland -RRB- on April 30 , 2012 .
Holland added in the same Spinner interview that it was producer Bob Rock who told him to write about Huntington .
`` It seems weird to write about your hometown-like you 're bragging or something , '' said the West Coast Native .
`` He said people in the rest of the world have a different perception of California .
It 's like a dream place .
It might be where you live , but others do n't see it the way you do .
You 've got to have fun .
It 's also a good way to cope .
There 's a lot of silly stuff out there , and it 's good to laugh and have fun with it . ''
Holland explained the song 's meaning to Spinner : `` It 's about what it 'd be like if I was driving down the beach in my hometown on a nice sunny day in Southern California , '' he said .
`` I live in Huntington Beach so I thought that 's what I should write about .
My hometown is great , and there 's a lot of fun reflected in the song .
At the same time , there are some shady and seedy parts .
I tried to put both of them in the lyrics .
It 's a great place , but there 's a dark underbelly as well .
Huntington Beach had some of the biggest riots in the '80s and '90s so that side of the place always existed .
At the end of the day , I want people to know it 's a fun , summer song . ''
