Dierks Bentley is not one for spending the evenings at home slumped in front of his TV .
The Country musician 's first single from his sixth studio album is a fist-pumping party song about his friends having grown up without him and preferring to stay at home , whilst he still wants to go out for the night .
`` Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight/Is there anybody out there wants to have a cold beer and kick it to the morning light ?
, '' he sings .
Bentley explained to The Press of Atlantic City , `` it 's a song about trying to drag your buddies out to have a good time . ''
The song is based on actual incident involving stay-at-home buddies .
`` I wrote this song with some friends , about some friends of mine who I could n't get to go out on the town on a Friday night , '' Bentley recalled .
`` They were giving me some pretty weak excuses , so I had to make fun of them in the lyrics of this song .
No one was actually watching American Idol .
If one of my friends turned me down for American Idol on a Friday night , we 'd definitely have to exchange some words .
Nothing wrong with American Idol , but you can TiVo that show and watch it whenever you want .
When it 's Friday night , it 's time to go out and have a good time . ''
