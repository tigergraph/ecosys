This forceful track marked new territory for Hollywood Undead as their heaviest track to date .
`` We write a lot of different kind of stuff but for that one we wanted to do just a brutal f -- king metal track , '' said the band to Alternative Addiction at the time of its release .
`` So that was kind of the intention we had when we wrote that song .
But I think one thing that metal lacks in general is melody so it was kind of like writing a metal song but incorporating the melody that we do with any other song .
It was a bit of an experiment but by the end of it we really liked the song and we felt a lot of our fans would like it too so we put it on the record . ''
