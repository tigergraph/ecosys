This call to arms for women turns the schoolyard taunt of `` Anything you can do , I can do better '' into a catchy refrain .
Burke told the Metro newspaper December 7 , 2009 : `` It 's very girl empowering .
It 's more about girl power , no disrespect to fellas and all that but I thought it was cool to do a song about what men do but we can do better .
We did the song from scratch based on my personality .
This song means a lot to me . ''
This vintage Soul number was co-written and produced by Lady Gaga 's collaborator RedOne .
Burke told Pop Justice about working with the Moroccan/Swedish hitmaker : `` I 've got to say , Red was the one that basically got my personality out first .
Then everything else slipped into place like a puzzle .
Red really started it off for me .
He had songs already ready for me , right ?
And then I walked in , and he met me , and he was like , ` scrap every song we 've just prepared for you , we 're going to start from scratch , because you 're not the person I thought you would be . '
So then he wrote according to my personality . ''
Burke said of the video to Metro : `` We have taken it up a notch -LSB- from `` Bad Boys '' -RSB- .
It was scary to go that side .
We showed a bit of skin but it was fun .
I was comfortable with it , though , it was done very tastefully .
I wanted to make sure this video was different and I wanted to make sure it was n't a load of girls who are , in the press 's eyes , perfect .
I have some plus-sized girls in there .
They are hot too .
We are all working it .
It is going to show people that no matter what your shape , colour , size , whatever you are , you are still beautiful . ''
