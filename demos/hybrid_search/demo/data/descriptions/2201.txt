This song is from the Broadway play Wicked , which is an adaptation of The Wizard Of Oz .
It is sung by Elphaba , who is the Wicked Witch of the West .
The song is about Elphaba going mad , because she feels she caused Fiyero 's -LRB- her lover -RRB- death .
It is when she has had enough helping people and doing good things to save their lives , because they always turn against her , like when she turned Boq into the Tin woodsman to save his life , as his heart was shrinking .
The chanting you hear in the beginning , is the spell she says that turns Fiyero into the Scarecrow we see in The Wizard of Oz .
-LRB- thanks , crystal - gardendale , AL -RRB-
