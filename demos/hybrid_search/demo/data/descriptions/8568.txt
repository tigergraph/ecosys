When The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe was being developed as a motion picture , it was Relient K lead singer Matt Thiessen 's hope to have a song included on the `` Music Inspired By '' album .
With this goal in mind , he wrote this song .
It wound up , instead , on the band 's EP Apathetic , which is dedicated to the band 's friend , Aaron Marrs , who worked with Christian Music label Gotee Records , and who was featured on the cover of their Employee of the Month EP .
Aaron Marrs , a filmmaker who owned his own company called Paper Jack Films , was aboard the 92-foot fishing boat Big Valley filming a documentary when it went down in rough seas off the coast of Alaska in January 2005 .
Although the true cause of the boat 's capsizing may never be known , a preliminary Coast Guard investigation reported that Big Valley - one of the smallest boats in its fleet - was overladen with more than three-times the weight in crab pots and bait as officially allowed .
Relient K was featured along with Bleach , John Reuben , The Kick , The Lonely Hearts , and The Evan Anthem , in a memorial concert for Marrs a few months after his death .
With over 100 million copies in print in 41 languages , C.S. Lewis ' The Chronicles of Narnia series is his most well-known and popular work .
Widely thought of as the first book in the series , The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe is actually the second .
Chronologically , the first book is The Magician 's Nephew .
The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe finds 4 children swept through a magical portal into the land of Narnia , which is always covered in snow .
It is a majestic fantasy into which children and adults alike are drawn as the history of this imaginary land unfolds , and the children overcome obstacles of good versus evil .
The story has myriad Christian overtones , including the central character of Aslan , the lion , who helps the children battle evil throughout the series .
