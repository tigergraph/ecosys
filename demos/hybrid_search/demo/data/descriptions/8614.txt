An auto-tuned West laments about a failed relationship on this track , whilst R&B recording artist Tony Williams adds some Soul-infused vocals .
Kanye 's older cousin on his mom 's side , Williams first became noticed as a singer when he sung on the Gospel hymn `` I 'll Fly Away '' from the rapper 's The College Dropout album .
He also wrote the hook for the Late Registration song , `` Roses , '' which featured him singing with Patti Labelle .
Jay-z liked this one so much when West debuted Yeezus at a playback that it was played twice .
`` Hov wanted me to bring that one back , '' Ye told the guests .
The song features a prominent sample of Nina Simone 's version of the song Billie Holiday made famous : the chilling `` Strange Fruit . ''
The horns were borrowed from TNGHT 's `` R U Ready . ''
TNGHT is a musical duo consisting of Producer/DJs Lunice and Hudson Mohawke .
The latter is signed as an artist to West 's G.O.O.D. Music and contributed to several of Yeezus ' tracks .
He debuted the song on June 10 , 2013 during his DJ set at Parklife Festival in Manchester .
`` R U Ready '' was originally used by Kanye West in 2012 during his fashion show .
Kanye West rapped the song at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards in front of a backdrop of Steve McQueen 's photograph , Lynching Tree .
Following his intimate performance , West 's website was updated to feature the Lynching Tree picture , along with the accompany text : `` This tree was used for lynching .
Those who were murdered are buried in the ground around the tree . ''
