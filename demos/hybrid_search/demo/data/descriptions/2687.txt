Vocalist Mike Donehey explained to NewReleaseTuesday the concept that inspired this song : `` Maybe this song wo n't be a revolutionary thought for you , but it has been for me .
Probably for the last two years or so , this is the thing I have felt that God has been teaching me .
Or should I say , the thing that He has been beating me over the head with .
Truth is a person . '
I am the way , the truth , and the life , and no one comes to the Father but by me . '
-LRB- Jesus -RRB- .
How did I miss that for so long ?
I do n't know .
Maybe it was growing up in the church , maybe it was Christian school , maybe it was the fact that I have an enemy in myself and in the devil , but man !
Why has it taken so long to sink in ? ''
