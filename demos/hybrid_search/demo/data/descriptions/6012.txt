After contributions to Ke $ ha 's `` Blah Blah Blah '' and 3OH !
3 's `` Follow Me Down , '' plus a guest spot on Gym Class Heroes ' '' `` Ass Back Home , '' English singer-songwriter Neon Hitch finally found some success under her own name with this song .
The lead single , from the songstress ' debut album , Beg , Borrow and Steal , it became her first # 1 as a solo artist when the tune hit the top of the Dance Club Songs chart in its sixth week .
The album track is titled `` F -- k U Betta , '' so when you hear this song being played on the radio it will most likely be this censored version .
This Benny Blanco-produced Electro-Pop song was penned by Hitch with Benjamin Levin and Lauren Christy .
It finds the singer asserting her feminine power .
`` I wrote -LSB- `` Love U Betta '' -RSB- with my friend Lauren Christy after I had broken up with a boyfriend , who had told me that he started dating a model .
I was like , ` Yeah , she 's prettier than I 'll ever be , but can she do it like me ? ' ''
she recalled to Billboard magazine .
`` Then we gave it to Benny , and Benny was freaking out over it . ''
Hitch filmed a steamy video to accompany the song .
She explained she did so as revenge to her former boyfriend : `` It 's quite raunchy , '' the singer admitted to AOL Music .
`` The song is called `` F -- You Betta '' so I needed a raunchy video to go with the raunchy song .
I wanted to make something beautiful .
It 's for my ex boyfriend - it 's about him - dedicated to him . ''
