New York native Pia Toscano was born on October 14 , 1988 , to Jane and Pat Toscano .
She began performing in talent shows when she was four , and by the time she was nine , had performed in a local church production of Jesus Christ Superstar .
Toscano was the official National Anthem singer at her middle school , P.S. / M.S. 207 , before attending LaGuardia High School of the Performing Arts in New York City and graduating in 2006 .
In 2008 Toscano was the winner of the New York Mets annual `` Anthem Search '' competition and was selected to sing the National Anthem at a game .
She also worked as a wedding singer in a band called `` Current Affair .
`` After several auditions for American Idol Toscano finally made it through to the Top 24 in the tenth season .
She was eliminated from the competition on April 7 , 2011 , finishing in ninth place .
Considered by some to be a frontrunner , her elimination came as a shock to judges Randy Jackson , Jennifer Lopez , and Steven Tyler , all of whom were visibly upset and vocal .
However , the publicity from her appearances led to a recording contract with Interscope Records .
The empowerment anthem has a double meaning of not only shaking off a guy who did her wrong but also relating to Toscano 's American Idol journey .
She told MTV News : `` It 's a journey of self-discovery and empowerment , and it 's not just a break-up song . ''
Despite there being no specific break-up in her past to serve as an inspiration , Toscano added that she felt like the tune suited her well .
`` I can 100 percent relate to it whether it 's about a relationship or my journey on ` Idol , ' '' she said .
This acoustic guitar and beat-driven track is Toscano 's debut single .
The song , which was released on July 12 , 2011 , was penned by Ester Dean .
The pop/R & B singer-songwriter has written several hit singles for Rihanna including `` Rude Boy `` and `` What 's My Name ? ''
and also co-penned Katy Perry 's chart-topper `` Firework '' and Scotty McCreery 's debut single `` Love You This Big . ''
