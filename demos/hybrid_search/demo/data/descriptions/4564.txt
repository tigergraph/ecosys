Primal Scream frontman Bobby Gillespie portrays here on this bluesy tune a kitchen-sink scenario of alcoholism and poverty .
He explained to NME that it 's `` a seven-minute song about domestic violence from the point of view of the child . ''
The impromptu jazzy orchestral crescendo in the middle of the song is courtesy of the Sun Ra Arkestra .
Gillespie recruited the American Jazz legends when they were stranded in London by an Icelandic volcano eruption .
