This biting send-off is the final track on Whitney Houston 's seventh album , I Look to You .
The song was written and produced by the R&B singer-songwriter R. Kelly who was also the man behind the album 's title track .
Kelly 's vocals are featured -LRB- `` Eh eh eh '' -RRB- on this cut .
One line has surprised some of Whitney 's fans .
A curse word is used -LRB- though it 's bleeped -RRB- when she sings , `` You think that your s -- do n't stink , but it do . ''
Lyrically the song is an acerbic salute to a departing lover who has done her wrong .
Many reviewers and bloggers have pondered if Whitney is channeling here her former husband Bobby Brown .
