This song is about death coming from a child 's point of view .
When Amy Lee was 6 years old , her sister Bonnie , who was 3 years old , died .
Amy was at school when she found out , hence the line `` Playground school bell rings again , rain clouds come to play again . ''
What she 's saying in the song is what she felt when she found out , and since she was so young , she did n't fully understand the concept of death .
