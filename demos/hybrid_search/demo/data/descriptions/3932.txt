This Celestial number features a theremin and also a harp played by Kirsten Agnesta .
The original plan was for the track to feature Badu 's musicianship on the strings .
`` She was going to play the harp on the song , '' said the singer 's A&R man Kay K. Rosemond during a listening session .
`` But she changed her mind at the last minute . ''
