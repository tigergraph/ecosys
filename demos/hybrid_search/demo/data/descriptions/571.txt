This was penned by the British Dubstep producers Chase & Status during one of several intense US writing camps they attended that was led by the production team Stargate .
They resulted in three cuts on Rihanna 's Rated R album as well as this song .
`` Those writing camps are 24 hours a day , in a bowl , for two weeks , '' Saul Milton , a.k.a. Chase recalled to The Guardian June 27 , 2013 .
`` You need to be producing two full songs a day , from scratch , fully vocalled , or they 're like ` what the hell are you doing ? ' ''
Chase & Status were surprised that this song , originally intended for Lupe Fiasco , then Rihanna , then Ne-Yo , ended up with Alexandra Burke .
`` It was n't about the money , '' said Will `` Status '' Kennard .
`` We did n't think it was going to be a big single or anything . ''
`` So she came in and sang it , '' he added .
`` We did n't particularly like anything about it , or her , to be honest , but whatever .
It was done . ''
