Blake collaborated with legendary producer Brian Eno on this track after the pair bonded over a shared love of gospel music .
Blake said of Eno 's love of `` Peace Be Still '' a 1962 cut by Reverend James Cleveland and the Angelic Choir : `` It just happened to be my favourite song too .
We obviously had something in common . ''
