This old-school-style R&B track produced by Ryan Leslie had bloggers and fans chattering as soon as it debuted on the net .
This was because it appeared to make several references to the breakdown of Brown 's relationship with Rihanna all in verse two .
They include :1 .
A reference to Canadian rapper Drake and the rumored romance between him and Rihanna -LRB- `` While we 're on Drake / Say that you 're the best he 's ever had '' -RRB- - a romance Drake has always denied .
Brown also alludes to `` rumors coming '' and says he `` knows what you keep in shadow . ''
The singer gets more explicit in the chorus , when he croons , `` Since I thought I found my woman / There were other guys who thought the same thing about it / Like damn , you let me down , down , down / 'Cause you 're famous , girl , for breaking hearts .
`` 2 .
Brown suggests that violence between them went both ways -LRB- `` You were the first to play the game , though '' -RRB- .3 .
Brown also sings , `` Sorry I bust the windows out your car , '' possibly referring to reports that he smashed the window of a vehicle during an argument with Rihanna that occurred before the assault in early 2009.4 .
Brown admits , `` I might have cheated at the beginning , '' and cryptically adds , `` I was wrong for writing ` Disturbia , ' '' a reference to the Rihanna track he wrote for her Good Girl Gone Bad album .
He then continues , `` But I meant it in ` Forever ' / We were supposed to be together / And I ca n't let you go . ''
`` Forever '' most likely refers to his own hit of the same name that spawned a viral wedding video .
In addition to the already mentioned `` Disturbia '' and `` Forever '' Brown quotes from several other songs in verse two .
They are :1 .
Keri Hilson 's `` Knock You Down '' - -LRB- `` Keri would 've said my love knocks her down '' -RRB- 2 .
Keyshia Cole 's `` Heaven Sent '' and Beyonc√© 's `` Halo '' in the couplet `` Keyshia would 've told me I was sent from heaven / Sorry , B , I do n't wear no halo '' .3 .
Jazmine Sullivan 's `` Bust Your Windows '' - -LRB- `` Sorry I bust the windows out your car '' -RRB- .
When MTV News asked Brown who , exactly , is this famous girl ?
Is it Rihanna ?
He declined to specify . ''
` Famous Girl ' is what it is , '' he said .
`` I mean , it really does n't need any explanation .
I think what ` Famous Girl ' does is just explain how I felt and how I feel about certain situations .
So if you want to know what it is , listen to it . ''
