American musician and former frontman of Whitestarr , Cisco Adler , features on this track , along with all the other songs on the album .
Adler also produced this song along with most of the Let It Beat tracks .
Shwayze told MTV News : `` The song was pretty much a party song , and it really pinpoints and describes how a man feels when he 's at the club a little intoxicated , sees a pretty girl , but home is far away , or maybe you do n't have enough money to get a hotel . ''
The music video was directed by Stewart Hendler , who is also the director of Soroity Row .
It features Leah Pipes , Rumer Willis , Briana Evigan , Caroline D'Amore and Margo Harshman who also all appear in the film .
