The Killers open their fourth studio album , Battle Born , with this electro-rock self-help anthem , in which Brandon Flowers declares that he is , `` cut from the cloth , the flag that bears the name of `` Battleborn . ''
The singer is referencing the nickname for the band 's home state of Nevada .
It was producer Steve Lillywhite who suggested the bridge section .
Flowers recalled on the Spotify streaming site .
`` We had the song pretty much done then Steve Lillywhite came in to assist .
He suggested this new Motown-influenced section . ''
He added : `` It 's like a weird left turn to Detroit , but it 's awesome !
We would n't have done that without him . ''
