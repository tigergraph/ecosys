McCartney told the Mail on Sunday May 12 , 2008 about this song : `` This really is like a short story .
I 've done that in the past , not always writing from a personal perspective .
It 's good , because you use your imagination more , and that 's something I enjoy .
I wrote about Eleanor Rigby , but I do n't know a woman who picks up rice in a church , and nor do I know anyone stranded in the transit lounge of an airport , as in ` Only Mama Knows . '
But I like to get into those imaginary stories , then follow them through and become that character .
The lead character in this song is someone who was left by his mother , does n't know why she left him and does n't know if he 'll ever see his father 's face .
It 's interesting because it takes you out of yourself .
You can become an alter ego .
It does n't have to be Paul McCartney singing it - it can be this other guy singing .
It 's good to do ; it lets you have another vocal approach , another emotional approach . ''
