This is the title track of the sixteenth studio album by the Californian punk rock band Bad Religion .
The record was partially developed out of a realization that the six members had all reached an age of what they were like when they first started the band .
Vocalist and songwriter Greg Graffin told Billboard magazine : `` The whole concept of finding true north fits that mode very well , because it 's suggesting that something you set out to do when you 're a youngster does n't have to fall by the wayside as you become a man or a woman in this world .
You still have to look for and constantly challenge the things you 're told in order to find your own sense of direction , and in order to motivate you to find truth in this world . ''
