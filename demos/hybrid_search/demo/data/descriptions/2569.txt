This hair-metal stomper is the opening track from 2009 American Idol runner-up Adam Lambert 's debut album , For Your Entertainment .
The song was penned by former Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins .
Lambert told Rolling Stone why he recorded this track : `` It has a classic rock riff to it that I thought was so sexy .
Another band that was a major reference was Queen .
You hear that influence in a couple different songs , and the chorus of that song , I wanted the harmonies to sound like Queen , I wanted it to be really full .
Also , bands like Sweet used to do that with their vocals , Glam bands .
I just wanted to show people I had a sense of humor with this s -- t. It 's fun , it 's supposed to be kind of campy . ''
This was one of four tracks on the album , which was helmed by A-list producer Rob Cavallo -LRB- Green Day , My Chemical Romance , Kid Rock -RRB- .
Cavallo also worked with the 2008 Idol winner David Cook on the album he recorded after winning the show .
