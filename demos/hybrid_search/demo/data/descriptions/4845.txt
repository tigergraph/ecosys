Lamar chronicles the struggle of growing up in Compton on this track where he spits rhymes about poverty , gang war , and the crack epidemic .
Most of the cuts on Good Kid , M.A.A.d City find the rapper discussing his life in the infamous Californian city .
`` The kid that 's trying to escape that influence , '' he explained to HipHopDX.com , `` trying his best to escape that influence , has always been pulled back in because of circumstances that be . ''
Pharrell Williams supplied the beat for this track .
`` Pharrell really does this music like this is his first time in the studio .
He still got that hunger , '' Lamar told Billboard magazine of working with the renowned producer .
`` He 's one of the producers that pulls out his keyboard and pulls up the session and make a crazy beat right front of you . ''
`` We knocked out six records in two days , '' he added .
`` Just by off the vibin ' -LSB- and -RSB- creating from scratch .
To hear all the music that he 's making and reminisce all the music that I love to listen to , he 's making it right in front of me now is a crazy feeling . ''
The cover of Good Kid , Mad City features a Polaroid dating from 1991 in which a young child sits in the lap of an uncle who is also holding a gang sign .
We see on the table both a bottle of malt liquor and a baby bottle .
`` We got photo books full of pictures like that , '' Lamar told Spin magazine .
`` I was in that atmosphere every day until my teenage years .
`` The Compton rapper added that he picked the photo , `` for the innocence in that kid 's eyes , not knowing that a baby bottle and a 40-ouncer ... It 's still so vivid to me .
This picture shows how far I really come . ''
