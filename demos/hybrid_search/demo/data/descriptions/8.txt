Sara Quin wrote this song about a dream she had after her grandmother died .
In the dream , she was in her grandmother 's bedroom and someone stabbed her , but she did n't die .
-LRB- thanks , sara - everson , WA -RRB- The whole album The Con was written at a turbulent point in their lives ; Tegan was feeling the pangs of the end of a five-year relationship , while Sara was struggling to get her own significant other 's immigration to Canada finalized .
That 's Chris Walla , of Death Cab for Cutie fame , on bass , and renowned multi-instrumentalist and composer Kaki King on lap steel guitar .
Tegan and Sara are known to be quite chummy with their indie music peers ; The Con also includes guest musicians Jason McGerr of Death Cab for Cutie , Matt Sharp from Weezer , and Hunter Burgan of AFI .
Notice the odd , tinkling , music-box quality to the instrumentals here , and the way they seem to come together with the melody almost accidentally .
It reminds you of the quote from the A.V. Club about how the best Tegan and Sara songs stumble along recklessly , and then falling together .
