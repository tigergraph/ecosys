This is the first single off San Francisco Alternative Rock band Third Eyed Blind 's fourth studio album , Ursa Major .
Jenkins explained the album title to Marie Claire magazine : `` Ursa Major is the constellation of the bear .
It 's good for us because we 've been hibernating and now we 've awakened and we are hungry for spring and we want to feed and we want to thrive . ''
Jenkins told Alternative Addiction in a September 2010 interview that the message of this song is not so relevant now Barack Obama has replaced George Bush as president .
He explained it , `` was aimed at the deceit that went on and the lyrics if I remember go on about the lies at the court of King George and he 'll wake up screaming .
I certainly do n't feel that way now because we got our man elected . ''
This intensely political song underwent numerous lyrical changes between its live debut and its radio release in 2009 .
Stephan Jenkins , lead singer and songwriter for the group , told The Huffington Post that it is indicative of the band 's style , saying , `` the song is full angry , bold and dirty and so are we . ''
The album debuted at # 3 on the Billboard 200 chart making it the highest charting set of the San Francisco band 's career .
The group had previously peaked as high as # 12 with Out of the Vein in 2003 .
