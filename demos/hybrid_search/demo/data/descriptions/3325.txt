Dunn came up with the title before penning this straight-up love song about turning down temptation for the one you love with Craig Wiseman and David Lee Murphy .
He recalled to The Boot : `` I was reaching up to grab a bottle of water and I yelled back at them , ` What about ' I do n't dance ? '
`` From this original idea , the three songwriters created the second track of Dunn 's debut solo album , Ronnie .
`` I said , ` We do it with a twist : one verse you talk about how you do n't dance , but the crux of the story is that it 's a love story about how you 're going to stay true to love , ' '' Dunn continued .
`` It 's not a cheating song at all .
It 's about how hard to face temptation and all the other demonic things I see . ''
