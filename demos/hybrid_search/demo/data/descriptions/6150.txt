Dave Grohl has retained throughout his Foo Fighters career a knack for penning monster choruses , and Wasting Light 's opening track confirms he 's still got the skill .
The Foo Fighters frontman revealed to UK newspaper The Daily Star that he had been using certain '70s chart friendly bands as an influence in penning his catchy choruses .
He said : `` I like loads of crazy-ass , dissonant , distorted rock 'n' roll .
But I also love the Bee Gees and ABBA , bands whose pop choruses get bigger and bigger.I love anthemic choruses , that overwhelming feeling of release that you can connect with .
So whenever I thought I had a big enough chorus for a song , I would use that as the pre-chorus and then I would try and write something even bigger , like they did . ''
