Frontman Cormac Neeson -LRB- from Kerrang !
February 21 , 2009 -RRB- : `` Lyrically I suppose that one deals the most directly with the world we 're living in at the minute , the one that as you know yourself has the shallow music industry parties that you 've got to go to , and everybody 's a smiling face and a compliment and you have to really see through that .
There 's just some point along the way you just get sick of it .
You 're just talking like that because you 're off your face on coke and you do n't mean what you 're saying .
The Black Crowes influenced this song and there 's a bit of AC/DC in there too .
It 's just a good strong rock 'n' roll song that we have a lot of fun playing live . ''
