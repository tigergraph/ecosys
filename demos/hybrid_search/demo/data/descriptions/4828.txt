Avril is married to Sum 41 lead singer Deryck Whibley , and in this song she expresses how she feels when they are apart , something that happens a lot when they are each touring .
-LRB- thanks , sarah - raliegh , VA -RRB- Lavigne told MTV News that she did n't deliberately set out to write a love song .
She said : `` I was writing a slow song and that just brings out all that stuff in you , all that emotional stuff .
It 's not cheesy , because I wrote it .
If I was older , a professional writer coming up with all that , that would be lame . ''
Avril wrote this with Butch Walker , who also produced the track .
This reached # 1 in several countries including Argentina , Indonesia and Portugal .
