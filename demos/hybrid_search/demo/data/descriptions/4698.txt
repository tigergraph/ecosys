Several versions of this song about infatuation were recorded by Joni Mitchell , the best known being the one on her Blue album .
An earlier live interpretation can be found on the live LP Amchitka - The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace .
Mitchell later re-recorded the song on her 1974 live record Miles of Aisles .
In addition , an orchestral version featuring a new vocal by Mitchell can be found on her 2000 concept album , Both Sides Now .
The song can also be found on many bootleg recordings from Mitchell 's 1983 tour .
Many artists have covered the song including Tori Amos , k.d. lang and Prince .
The latter 's version , retitled `` A Case of U '' was recorded for his 2002 album , One Nite Alone ... There have been two covers that have charted Frank Stallone -LRB- the brother of actor Sylvester Stallone -RRB- released his version as the follow up to his 1980 hit single `` Far From Over , '' peaking at # 67 .
In 2013 James Wolpert reached # 72 on the Hot 100 with his acoustic interpretation after singing it on The Voice .
The version found on Blue features Mitchell playing Appalachian dulcimer , accompanied by James Taylor on acoustic guitar and Russ Kunkel on drums .
Kunkel is widely regarded as one of the top session drummer of the 1970s and early '80s working with many of the leading artists of the era including Bob Dylan , Neil Young , Carole King , Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt .

Mitchell declined , however , to grant permission for the rather obvious use of the song in the 2013 romantic comedy , A Case of You .
