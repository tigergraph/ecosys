Steel Magnolia comprises Meghan Linsey and her boyfriend Joshua Scott Jones .
After winning season two of CMT 's talent show Can You Duet , the duo signed a recording contract with Big Machine Records , and released their debut single `` Keep On Lovin ' You '' in August 2009 .
This Lori McKenna and Chris Tomkins penned song is a track from their self-titled debut album .
This song is a strong , female anthem .
The Boot asked Meghan if Joshua has a problem recording songs in that vein ?
`` That was my one thing on the record that I was like , ` Man , we have to have this song , '' she explained .
`` Most of the time we 're a duo .
I have the one song on the record that I sing pretty much by myself , which is ` Bulletproof , ' and then he has ` Glass Houses , ' which he wrote and put on the record as well .
We try to mix it up and give everybody something .
We have a lot of female fans , so we want to give them a little balls . ''
Linsey explained to The Boot that she later found out it was previously recorded by a friend for a currently unreleased album .
`` Emily West and I are actually really good friends , '' Meghan said .
`` I did n't know that she had cut that song when we went in and cut .
Then someone was like , ` Oh , that 's Emily West 's song . '
So , I texted her , ` Dude , we 've cut the song that 's on your record . '
It was fine because we 're friends .
I think that should be a single for her , I love it .
`` Not familiar with Emily West ?
