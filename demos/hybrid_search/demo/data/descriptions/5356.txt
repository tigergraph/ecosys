`` Get Outta My Dreams , Get Into My Car '' is the top single from Ocean 's 1988 album Tear Down These Walls , and also his third # 1 hit single on the Billboard Hot 100 .
It was written by Billy Ocean and producer Robert John `` Mutt '' Lange , who is a legend in his own right for having produced AC/DC , Def Leppard , Foreigner , The Cars , Bryan Adams , and many others .
His resume is practically the who 's - who of '80s music , so this song sounds like the kind of hit you 'd expect from him .
This song was part of the soundtrack to the 1988 film License to Drive , a Brat-Pack teen flick featuring the `` two Coreys . ''
NASCAR fans will also recognize this song as having been covered by Fenix TX for the video game NASCAR Thunder 2003 .
And one more media mention : it was featured in the debut for The Tonight Show With Conan O'Brien , with O'Brien bebopping around town to the song .
Notice that the song 's structure , while sounding very much like 1988 , still manages to break out of the decade and hold its own in later times .
There 's the stereotypical synthesizers , jerky beat , jazzy pop , and the video even mixes animation in with live action - but not too , too much of any one thing .
Skillfully executed !
By turning the words `` Out Of '' into `` Outta '' in the title , Ocean kept it to eight words , which is good like for him .
His previous American # 1s both had eight-letter titles as well -LRB- `` Caribbean Queen -LRB- No More Love On The Run -RRB- , '' `` There 'll Be Sad Songs -LRB- To Make You Cry -RRB- '' -RRB- , while his nine letter hit , `` When The Going Gets Tough , The Tough Get Going , '' stalled at # 2 .
