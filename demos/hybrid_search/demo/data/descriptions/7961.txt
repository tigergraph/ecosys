This was the first single from Mellencamp 's ninth album , The Lonesome Jubilee .
Like many songs on the album , it deals with social inequality and the disparity of wealth in America .
The `` paper in fire '' represents the dreams that disappear when Americans are hit with the harsh realities that destroy them .
Considering how successful he had become , you might think Mellencamp would be more optimistic , but he always connected with the working class and never fell for the trappings of fame .
Another factor is that a lot was going wrong for Mellencamp : his uncle and grandfather had recently died , and many of his friends were getting divorced .
`` It 's horrible to think you 've got ta be a miserable son of a bitch to write a good song , '' he said at the time , `` but I guess that 's kind of the way it works sometimes . ''
The video was shot outside of a house on a dirt road in Savannah , Georgia .
Mellencamp wanted to show poverty in America to go along with the social commentary in the song , and also explore racism - the extras in the video are black .
His next video - for `` Hard Times For An Honest Man '' - was also shot in Savannah .
The Lonesome Jubilee was an ambitious album with songs that spanned a variety of genres .
`` Paper in Fire '' incorporated an Appalachian sound , with a prominent fiddle -LRB- played by Lisa Germano -RRB- and accordion -LRB- played by John Cascella -RRB- .
Much of the album was conceived by Mellencamp and his band while they were on his Scarecrow tour , which gave them a lot of time to hone their ideas .
Mellencamp was very happy with the sound of the album , and has pointed out that the Appalachian vibe on this track was soon became a trend in popular music .
