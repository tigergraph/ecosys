This song is about a man who comes home to see his wife in bed with another man .
He starts outside the house watching until he builds up so much rage that he sneaks into the house and up to the room .
The character then confronts the two in the act and -LRB- many explicative words later -RRB- decides to kill them one at a time while the other watches .
The man then turns the gun on himself .
The lead singer Justin Furstenfeld said that this is the song that gave the album a parental advisory sticker .
-LRB- thanks , Andrew - Evansville , IN -RRB-
