There are many songs called simply `` You '' , but Harrison wrote this one in 1970 , although it was not released for five years .
In an in-depth interview and review of his new album with Ray Coleman in the September 6 , 1975 issue of Melody Maker , Harrison said this song was written for Ronnie Spector , who was then married to Phil Spector .
The two were scheduled to co-produce , but this never happened .
There could be many possible reasons for this.In February 2003 , Spector murdered Lana Clarkson in bizarre circumstances , but thirty years before that he was alleged to have pulled a gun on John Lennon .
Phil Spector married Veronica Bennet in 1968 , but he appears to have developed some bizarre obsession , literally holding her a prisoner in his mansion .
She had to physically escape , in 1972 , and the two were divorced .
`` You '' has a jazzy feel to it , and features Leon Russell on piano .
Running to 3 minutes 44 seconds , it was released as a single on the Apple label backed by `` World Of Stone '' .
