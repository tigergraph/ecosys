R&B / Pop singer Jordin Sparks ' first single from her third studio album is an empowering female anthem .
She explained to AOL Music : '' ' I Am Woman ' is a song about different aspects of the lives of women .
It could be a mother , a performer , a woman working in a corporate space - it 's all about what we go through as women and how our lives are so crazy .
Walk a mile in my shoes , or in my stilettos , if you dare and see what happens .
It 's all about the strengths that a woman has : how we can multitask and carry so much , yet still always be on point when we need to be and on cue when we need to be .
It 's all about the amazingness of a woman . ''
Sparks co-wrote the song with Ryan Tedder .
The OneRepublic singer and songwriter-for-hire previously produced and co-wrote the American Idol champ 's hit single , `` Battlefield . ''
