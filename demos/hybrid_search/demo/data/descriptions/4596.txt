Frontman George Craig hooked up with classmates Mark Hayton -LRB- guitar -RRB- , Dan Parkin -LRB- bass -RRB- Jack Sails -LRB- keyboards -RRB- and Sam Ford -LRB- drums -RRB- at school in North Yorkshire .
He then took up a place in the sixth form at Ampleforth College , a Roman Catholic boarding school .
However when One Night Only became the focus of a record label bidding war , he left the college to follow his dreams .
Craig told the Daily Mail February 1 , 2008 `` This was written when I knew I was going to a new school .
I was happy to be moving , but also panicking that I would n't be able to be in the band any more . ''
