For this song , Taylor Hawkins and Dave Grohl switched roles .
Dave went behind the drum kit , and Taylor plays guitar and sings .
Taylor has also sang lead on the Foo 's covers of Cream 's `` I Feel Free , '' Joe Walsh 's `` A Life Of Illusion '' and Pink Floyd 's `` Have A Cigar . ''
Hawkins : `` It 's hard playing a demo for Dave because he 's like my older brother - I know when he thinks something sucks .
He says , `` Hmm , yeah that 's good , '' and then he 'll say , `` I really like how affected your vocals are . ''
Anyway , it 's a song Dave liked and it lightened up the acoustic record .
Everyone says it sounds like the Eagles !
When Dave was recording the drums I went from the control room into the live room and made a suggestion .
He was like , `` No .
I like what I 'm doing . ''
I reminded him of this recently but for some reason he did n't remember that . ''
-LRB- about quotes courtesy : Foo Archive -RRB- Taylor Hawkins on the song : `` I actually wrote this track , so I sing and Dave plays drums on it .
I 've had a rough sketch of the song for a long time and Dave has always liked it .
It 's got a real Southern Californian feel and it was fun producing Dave on drums .
Most of the tambourines that you hear are on the record are actually Dave - I hate playing tambourine !
- but on this song it 's me . ''
Though an acoustic song , an electric version of this song can be found on the CD/DVD Skin And Bones .
