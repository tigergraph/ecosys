Pistol Annies is the all-female trio of Miranda Lambert and fellow songwriters Angaleena Presley and Ashley Monroe .
Much of the material on their Hell On Heels album comes from their own experiences , including this song , which was penned by Presley .
She told CMT News : `` I came up with that idea when I was sitting on my living room couch .
I had just gone through - or was going through - a divorce , and I was contemplating burning my house down .
Because I did n't know what else to do .
And I was going over , ` Now , how can I do it , and the insurance company wo n't figure it out , and what should I do ?
What do I want to save ?
` And then I snapped to reality , and I was like , ` No , do not burn your house down . '
So I picked up my guitar and I wrote the first line of that song , and I shared it with these girls , and they were like , ` Yes ! '
Then the way that the song went on , it 's almost like Miranda 's personality .
She 's like , ` Yeah , a gallon of gas and the matches . ' ''
