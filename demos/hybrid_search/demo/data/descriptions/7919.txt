Shontelle wrote this song in Sweden with producer Martin Hansen .
It took the singer two days to record it as the first day she could n't stop crying due to the emotions of the song .
She explained why to Sound-Savvy : `` I was just literally going through a tough time in a relationship I was in .
I was doing a lot of thinking about it .
I was just like ... I really feel like I have to say hello to goodbye .
This might really be the end .
I think the end is really nearer than I thought .
I started getting really sad thinking about it .
I said , let me just pour my heart out on paper .
And then when it came time to sing it , to actually record it , it was harder than I expected it was going to be .
So I do n't know what I 'm going to do about performing it . ''
