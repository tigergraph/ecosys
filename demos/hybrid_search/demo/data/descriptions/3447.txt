This soulful ballad is a plea for compassion for those in the aftermath of recriminatory divorce .
Stewart , who has been twice divorced - from Alana Hamilton in 1984 and Rachel Hunter in 2006 - admitted to The Daily Telegraph that it 's `` a subject I know a little bit about . ''
He added : `` It 's the heartbreak for the kids that does me .
The second one was very painful , because she left me , there was no one else involved .
I wrote it for people that are going through that . ''
Asked by Mojo if it 's hard to write about something so personal , Rod replied : `` Rachel -LRB- Hunter -RRB- was the most recent so obviously there were reflections about that breakup in the song , but I tried to broaden it out for all blokes .
So many of my mates have gone through a divorce , and it really hits a nerve with them .
We all go through the same emotions , the same traumas , the kids get hurt . ''
Stewart co-wrote this with longtime spar and co-writer of `` Young Turks , '' Kevin Savigar .
He told Mojo magazine : `` Kevin sent me over the chorus sequence , I put me earphones on , ad-libbed the lyrics , and that 's how it was born .
I do n't think that 's a universal way of writing songs , but that 's the way I do it . ''
