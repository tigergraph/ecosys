This sinister track features eerie vocals from Swedish songstress Lykke Li .
The band explained the collaboration to Billboard magazine : `` She 's a friend of ours .
And she just came by the studio and wanted to hear the record .
We played it for her and she heard that song ... We were kind of thinking maybe it would be cool to have her because we toured together .
We used to do a duet on stage of a cover song that she had in her set .
And I do n't know , it just seemed like a good fit ; like we had sort of weird Kris Kristofferson , Dolly Parton thing going on or something . ''
