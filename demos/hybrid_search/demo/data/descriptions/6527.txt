Chad Gilbert -LRB- guitar -RRB- told Kerrang !
magazine February 16 , 2008 : `` This one shows how we 've changed .
We 're a band who have done different styles of songs every record .
There 's some really metal riffs on Catalyst that are n't on Coming Home , and then Coming Home had some pianos .
We 're music fans , so we want every record to sound different from each other . ''
The song 's video was based on a German mobile phone advert .
Gilbert explained to Kerrang !
: `` It starts backwards , with a guy and a girl in bed naked , and then they put on their clothes , finding them strewn as they walk , until they get to their first meeting at the end .
We just took the idea and went with it . ''
