In an interview with Mojo magazine June 2009 , Yusuf compared this life-affirming song to his 1970s hit `` Wild World . ''
He explained : '' ` Wild World ' was the going away , but ` Welcome Home ' is like the going away and coming home which is an interesting extension .
It tells you what happened along the way in quite pictorial terms : ` Two soldiers stood and stared/No one passes by us . ' ''
