This is a single from the Swedish DJ , remixer , record producer and record label owner Axwell , who is also part of the three person group dubbed the Swedish House Mafia .
The song features Errol Reid , who achieved worldwide chart hits as the lead vocalist of boyband China Black in the mid 1990s .
Axwell told MTV News about the song 's music video , which traces the journey of a 21st-century Christ-like character : `` The vocal , it sounds like it 's a Jesus kind of a thing .
With the whole ` Whatever you do , turn the other cheek ' and ' I got nothing but love for you , whatever you do . '
So I was like , ' I really like this idea , ' and it 's going to be kind of hard to pull off with it not being weird or upsetting .
I think the idea is that it 's a bit like how we would be if there was a modern Jesus among us . ''
