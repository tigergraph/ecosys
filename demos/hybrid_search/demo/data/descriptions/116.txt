Frontman Grant Nicholas told Kerrang !
magazine June 21 , 2008 about this song : `` I was trying to put myself in the mind of a youth who might be living in a bleak kind of place and who has just been through a break-up .
That 's kind of what it 's about .
I had been reading a lot of stuff about youth and knife crime and I think that inspired me .
There are a lot of personal things in there , too .
I need lyrics to mean something to me , otherwise I ca n't sing them so well . ''
