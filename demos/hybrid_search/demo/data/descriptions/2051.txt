American Punk Rock band The Offspring open their ninth studio album , Days Go By with this straight forward rocker in which Dexter Holland sings of the dangers of technology .
He explained to Spinner : `` You see people on their cell phones constantly .
Everybody is in the same room but no one is looking at each other or speaking .
You start to think , ` Does technology really bring us together , or does it isolate us ?
Does it help us , or does it hurt us ?
Does it give us more freedom , or does it enslave us in a way ? '
Everyone is tied to his or her device all of the time . ''
Holland sees the question of what technology does to society as an interesting idea .
He said that he decided to allude to it on Days Go By and put it out there as the first song on the album and its an concept that he might revisit on a later record .
