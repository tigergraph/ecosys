The Yardbirds reformed in the mid - '90s and Birdland was their first new studio album since 1967 .
This track was written by their drummer Jim McCarty .
Yardbirds bass player Chris Dreja says of the song on their official site : `` Rhythmically very exciting .
Jim wrote the song , and in his mind it was not meant to be treated like that , but we pumped the song up an awful lot .
It 's also got what I 'd describe as Afghan psychedelia in there - so very different .
My stepdaughter heard it , and I rarely play stuff for her because she 's so ` cool , ' but she really dug it .
Out of all the new material , it 's probably the most trippy , with the chanting and wonderful playing by Gypie . ''
