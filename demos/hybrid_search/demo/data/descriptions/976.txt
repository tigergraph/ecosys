The first official single from Kansas City native Tech N9ne 's twelfth studio album was produced by Wichita , Kansas native Seven and written by the rapper with his long term collaborator Krizz Kaliko .
It was released on May 4 , 2011 .
Tech N9ne was born Aaron Dontez Yates and his stage name originated from the TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun , given to him by rapper Black Walt due to his fast rhyming style .
The Dan Gedman directed video was premiered on May 29 , 2011 on MTV2 .
Though its Wizard of Oz concept came from Gedman , Tech N9ne also credits Tupac with helping to spark the idea .
He recalled the teasing he got from ` Pac and other rappers : `` I remember when I met Tupac in '92 at Jack the Rapper -LSB- music conference -RSB- at the Atlanta Hilton .
I used to be down there in the lobby and Tupac down there drunk , yelling and stuff .
I used to tell everybody I was from K.C. ; they was like , ` They let y' all rap in Kansas City ?
How 's Dorothy and Toto ? ' .
I 'm like , ` OK , watch this . ' ''
Tech has stated that the All 6 's and 7 's album title means `` in a state of confusion and disarray , '' adding that it was his `` biggest '' and `` craziest '' album of all .
It lived up to his boast , selling 55,715 copies in its first week of release and debuting at # 4 on the Billboard 200 , the first Top 10 placing of his career .
