This song was inspired by American 1930 's nightclub jazz music .
Nightwish keyboardist and chief songwriter , Tuomas Holopainen , was stirred to pen it after watching David Lynch 's Twin Peaks .
He explained to Metal Hammer magazine : `` You want to challenge yourself to do something that you have absolutely no idea about , and none of us know anything about jazz !
Our drummer even had to take some lessons to learn how to use the brush !
It all started when I started watching Twin Peaks again .
I just loved the soundtrack and thought , ` Could we do something like that ? '
and this is the result . ''
