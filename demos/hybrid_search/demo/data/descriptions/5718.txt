Frontwoman Cristina Scabbia explained this song 's meaning to Noisecreep : `` We imagine a sort of a trip that you can go on with you your car , driving for hours .
We imagine this cinegraphy late in the afternoon when the sun is coming down and you 're relaxed in your car going for a long trip .
That 's the image we got from it . ''
