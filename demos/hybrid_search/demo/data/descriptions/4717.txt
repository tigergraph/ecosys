This song is from the film The Seven Hills Of Rome in which it was sung by Mario Lanza .
It was written by Terry Gilkyson -LRB- who previously had performed with the legendary Folk group The Weavers in the early 1950s -RRB- , Richard Dehr and Frank Miller in 1955 .
In the US , a cover version by Gale Storm reached # 5 , while in the UK the TV comedian Dave King 's version also peaked at # 5 .
The song was adopted as the unofficial anthem for Hungarian refugees scattered around the world after the 1956 revolution against Soviet rule .
The backing vocals , singing `` Sweet , sweet , the memories you gave to me , '' belonged to Gilkyson , Dehr , and Miller , the 3 writers of the song , under the name of The Easy Riders .
They went on to have a # 4 hit in 1957 with the Folk song `` Marianne . ''
According to 1000 UK # 1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh , Terry Gilkyson 's daughter , the Folk singer and songwriter Eliza Gilkyson said of her father , `` He hated people looking for hidden meanings in his songs and he did it as a job .
He went to the office every day and often wrote about us .
Memories Are Made of This is about our family ; it 's him meeting my mother and having three kids . ''
