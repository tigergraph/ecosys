The first single from The Pet Shop Boys ' eleventh album , Elysium , is a bittersweet nugget , released to coincide with the 2012 London Olympics .
`` This is the moment we 'll remember every day for the rest of our lives , '' Neil Tennant sings .
The song was premiered on BBC Radio 2 's Ken Bruce Show on July 2 , 2012 .
Tennant told BBC Breakfast they originally thought of entering this song for the Eurovision Song Contest , after being invited by the BBC to submit a song for the annual song competition , but that it eventually evolved into their own anthem for the London 2012 Olympics .
`` It was slightly with Eurovision in mind , '' said Tennant .
`` The BBC asked us if we were interested , then when the album came out it seemed like the right time to release it . ''
The song 's music video is a mini-documentary about a transsexual called Dirty Diana , competing in a female-only roller derby team .
Elsyium was recorded in Los Angeles and the album title was inspired by a walk through the city 's Elysian Park .
