Neil Young wrote this song for his daughter , Amber Jean , who was 21 years old and in her last year of college .
He talks about how he will always be there for her and misses her .
He sings that he never wants to hold her down , but he will always be there if she closes her eyes.The song explores the complexities of being a parent watching their child bloom into an adult : `` Yes I 'd miss you , but I never want to hold you down .
You might say I 'm here for you , '' Neil sings , expressing both his absolute love for and unconditional faith in his daughter .
