This was written by Gram Parsons and Chris Ethridge while residing in their San Fernando Valley famously dubbed `` Burrito Manor . ''
The song , like the album The Gilded Palace of Sin , barely registered on the music world of 1969 - there was a lot going on that year .
However , those who did hear it quickly established a cult following for the band - that includes musicians such as Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones.The Flying Burrito Brothers are one of those acts more legendary within the music industry than in the consumer base .
Gram Parsons came from The Byrds , while Ian Dunlop and Mickey Gauvin came from the International Submarine Band .
At their peak , they were hob-nobbing with Keith Richards and opening for the Rolling Stones at the Altamont concert , which became a pivotal moment in the 1970 film Gim me Shelter .
Most surviving members leaving this group went on to found or join other bands.This album is cited as a major influence on the Eagles , as well as being a cornerstone of the New Traditionalist movement in mainstream Country music , influencing future artists such as Travis Tritt , Vince Gill , Alan Jackson , Clint Black , and Randy Travis .
The cover art for The Gilded Palace of Sin features the band wearing a set of custom country-Western suits from Nudie 's Rodeo Tailors , complete with marijuana leaf embroidery .
