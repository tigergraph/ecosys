Guitarist Mike Einziger -LRB- from Rock Sound magazine -RRB- : '' ` Defiance ' is a collection of ideas that we had played around with before .
We had tried to turn it into a full song many times but it never quite worked ; then we got into the studio and it was just perfect .
It 's a very simple song , just guitar and voice , and I think the beauty lies in the simplicity . ''
