This was Platnum 's first solo UK hit following their role as featured artists on H2O 's `` What 's It Gon na Be . ''
This is a cover of Danish singer Kristine Blonde 's dance hit `` Love Shy , '' which peaked at # 22 in the UK in 1998 .
Two years later a garage re-mix reached # 28 .
Platnum 's version was inspired by a further bassline re-mix by DJ/producer Shaun ` Banger ' Scott , which circulated as a white label in 2007 .
