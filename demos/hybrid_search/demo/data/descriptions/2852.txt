The title on this sarcastic apocalypse party song is also the adopted catchphrase of the American bluesman Seasick Steve .
In an article published on his website , the critic Bill Flanagan commented to Dylan that he uses the song 's New Age clich√© title as a hook , before asking how it got started .
Dylan replied : `` Probably from hearing the phrase one too many times . ''
