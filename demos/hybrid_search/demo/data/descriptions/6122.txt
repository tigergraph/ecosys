In Cinderella frontman Tom Keifer 's portfolio , you 're unlikely to hear a song that more reflects the influence of the blues on his musical journey .
With the making of Cinderella 's second album , Long Cold Winter , Keifer was intent on moving the band to a Blues-Rock sound .
In our interview with Tom Keifer , he notes he was inspired by his heros Led Zeppelin to start writing his own songs .
The band co-produced the album with Andy Johns , whose earlier experience in production included work on Led Zeppelin IV .
The lyrics are of a life that 's come full circle .
Mistakes acknowledged , no regrets .
You do n't have to live a lifetime to experience these emotions .
That 's the beauty of The Blues : it allows a musician like Tom Keifer to articulate and condense a life on the move .
He tells us a story of success and sorrow in a disciplined form that reflects soulful emotion .
This song 's first verse is introduced in stages .
Tom Keifer 's acoustic slide intro is reminiscent of Duane Allman playing acoustic slide using his famous Coricidin aspirin bottle .
Keifer runs with a Blues chord progression enhanced with a layer of soulful harmonica .
The backbeat is laid down with a powerful stomp from the bass drum , and the caveat at the end of the first verse is when Tom yells , `` come on boys '' and a wall of sound from the electric guitars and bass kicks in .
