Andrew Bird explained to Drowned in Sound : `` This song is dedicated to the guy at the end of the bar who makes inappropriate , unsolicited comments that make everyone uneasy .
He has spent so much time alone reading sci-fi novels and having internal conversations he has forgotten how to engage .
He needs human contact and that 's why he is there , but spends his time making somewhat X-rated medieval fantasy-art sketches of the bartenders .
I think he makes us so uneasy because he shows us what we could become .
The part of the song about burning effigies is a bit harder to explain .
I suppose I 'm saying it may appear to be a useless exercise .
That such public display may only be effective as an insect repellant .
Or to inspire us to remark sarcastically ` Wow , that guy is smoking two cigarettes instead of one . ' ''
