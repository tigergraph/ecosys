The Arctic Monkey 's single `` Why 'd You Only Call Me When You 're High ?
`` concerns drunken booty calls .
However , its even more wordily-titled B-side takes a much more romantic tack as Alex Turner sings about a man who wants to drop everything else in his life to go somewhere alone with his lover .
The song was released onto Arctic Monkeys official YouTube channel on August 30 , 2013 .
