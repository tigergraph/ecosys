This is the first solo single from former Pussycat Doll Kimberly Wyatt .
The song contains scathing references to Wyatt 's time with the girl group .
The singer quit the Dolls in February 2010 a few days after her colleague Jessica Sutta left them .
She explained to the men 's magazine Loaded why she became disenchanted : `` Everything was very set , and is very set with the Dolls .
It is a brand .
Well , I mean , it 's a huge brand .
It 's a name and we were hired to do our job and I did just that .
I feel like I can relate to anybody in a corporate job - because it 's just a job , nothing more . ''
