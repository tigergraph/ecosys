In the lead up to the release of American Rock band Emery 's We Do What We Want album on March 29 , 2011 , an MP3 for this song was spilt into seven sections .
For seven consecutive days , one new piece of `` Scissors '' was revealed through a different online media outlet .
The band daily gave a clue as to where the next clip would be released on their Facebook page , and fans were encouraged to collect all of the parts and put the song back together .
Morrell explained the inspiration for the song in an interview with Noisecreep : `` This song actually started out as a song about betrayal but half way through the recording process , it just did n't feel right .
It did n't lyrically fit .
So I played around with some of the lines and started an entirely different idea .
This song is now about a person finding out they are dying and how that impacts the faith they have claimed for their entire life .
It 's about testing your beliefs and the doubts vs. trust in your faith when things are at their worst .
Do you really believe what you say you do ? ''
Frontman Toby Morrell discussed the song 's meaning in an interview with Alternative Press : `` This song has it all .
It starts so heavy and then comes in with a really catchy melody that I feel our band are known for .
The story here is basically a guy finding out he 's going to die and somewhat questions his beliefs .
So many people struggle with death and God .
That 's natural and a way to actually come to a conclusion about what you really believe .
Is your God big enough to help you when all seems lost ?
What or who do you trust and what actually happens in the end ?
It 's a tough subject that ca n't be answered in one song , but I wrote this in order to call myself out , face my own insecurities and find where my strength lies . ''
