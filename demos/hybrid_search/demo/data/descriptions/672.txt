Little Boots sings about Fibonacci and Pythagoras in this song .
Leonardo Fibonacci -LRB- c1170-c1250 -RRB- was an Italian mathematician who was instrumental in the introduction of the Hindu/Arabic numerical system into Europe .
Fibonacci numbers , which are a sequence in which each number is the sum of its two predecessors , were named after him .
The Samian philosopher Pythagoras -LRB- c582-c500 -RRB- founded an educational society that was half-religious and half-philosophical .
His pupils were trained in gymnastics , mathematics and music .
Pythagoras and his students believed that everything was related to mathematics , and classified numbers according to their geometrical properties and he is regarded as the real founder of the science of Geometry .
Pythagoras used music as an essential organizing factor in his society .
His pupils regularly sang hymns to the god Apollo together and used the lyre to cure illness of the soul or body .
The Samian sage developed a type of musical tuning , in which the frequency ratios of the notes were all derived from the number ratio 3:2 .
This Pythagorean system was of primary importance in Western musical development in the Middle Ages .
Aristotle quoted Pythagoras as saying : : `` There is geometry in the humming of the strings .
There is music in the spacings of the spheres . ''
In this song , math is a metaphor for love .
It was inspired by the Sylvia Plath poem Love Is A Parallax , in particular the lines '' ... yet love / knows not of death nor calculus above / the simple sum of heart plus heart . ''
