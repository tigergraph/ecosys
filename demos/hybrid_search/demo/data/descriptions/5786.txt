This song is first and foremost about a destructive relationship that is addictive .
A man is in love with a woman who he knows is bad for him .
Their passion is shown in several different ways -LRB- `` This bed is on fire with passionate love , '' `` Fought with kitchen knives and skewers '' -RRB- .
Brian Eno produced the album .
There are hints of sexual androgyny with the lines `` Dress me up in women 's clothes , messed around with gender roles . ''
When Tim Booth 's voice goes into Falsetto at several points in this song , it adds to the idea .
-LRB- thanks , Jessie Ann - Purchase , NY , for above 2 -RRB- The song was covered by Matt Nathanson on the 2003 American Wedding soundtrack .
