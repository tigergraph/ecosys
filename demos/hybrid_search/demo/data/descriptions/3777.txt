This track , which was co-written with AFI 's Hunter Burgan , is from Canadian indie pop duo Tegan and Sara 's sixth studio album , Sainthood .
MTV News pointed out to Tegan and Sara that obsession has always been a theme for the duo .
Tegan agreed saying .
`` Every time we start writing a new record , I always think , ` OK , this is the record where I 'm going to start exploring other topics . '
And then I 'm like , ` What other topics am I going to explore , really ? ' ''
She added : `` I mean , I did -LSB- explore -RSB- a bit on Sainthood .
` Hell , ' ` Do n't Rush ' and ` The Cure , ' I wrote about my neighborhood , which I used as a metaphor for my relationship .
I tried to step outside , but it was still like masking my narcissism . ''
