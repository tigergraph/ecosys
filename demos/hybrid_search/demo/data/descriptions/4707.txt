Songwriters sometimes get inspired in unusual places for their songs - and this is one of them !
Chesney explained to Billboard magazine : `` I got the idea to write ` Reality ' in the dentist 's chair .
I 'm sitting there with a gas mask on .
There were a couple of years that I was so busy on the road I was kinda numb .
I was n't really tired , I was n't really not tired , I was n't really happy , I was just kind of numb .
So I 'd go to the dentist to have something done and they 'd put that gas mask on me and I 'd be like , ` Wow , that 's as relaxed as I 've been in years ! '
I thought to myself , ` This is why people smoke pot right here !
This is it ! '
I do n't smoke pot , but this is why people do it , I guarantee you .
Because it gets them away from reality .
I even asked my dentist , ' I just want to come over here and sit some time , can you guys do that ? '
He said , ` We ca n't do that , we 'd get in trouble . '
I swear , I started writing that song on the way home .
But then I related it to everybody that comes to see us .
That 's what live music is .
It 's an escape from reality .
That 's why as a kid I loved it .
I still love going to shows , I love live music .
That 's where I got the idea to write the song , it 's my message to the fans that it 's OK to break free and escape reality , with us . ''
The song was Chesney 's 21st Country # 1 .
It took 23 weeks to climb to the peak position , the singer 's slowest chart-topping climb of his career .
It surpassed Chesney 's 22-week rise with `` You Had Me from Hello , '' which finally reached the summit on the September 18 , 1999 survey .
