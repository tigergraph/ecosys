Deap Vally are a Rock duo consisting of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Troy and drummer Julie Edwards .
Troy told Coup de Main magazine about their songwriting process : `` We 're definitely a jam-based band , '' she said , `` so writing is mostly done with Julie behind the kit , and me with my electric guitar and a microphone .
Sometimes we 'll come in with a riff idea , or I 'll come in with a lyric idea or Julie will come in with a lyric idea or a beat or something , and then we jam it out together - and that 's when we really kind of figure out the song .
And just like playing it live and seeing what gels and making changes to it .
So it 's always different , but that keeps it really nice and exciting . ''
This song finds the Californian pair recasting the trip home after a one-night stand into a walk of pride .
`` We wanted to turn the shame upside down , '' Edwards told NME .
