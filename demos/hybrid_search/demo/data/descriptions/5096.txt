Having just released a series of mixtapes and one EP , Brooklyn , NY-based rapper Theophilus London found himself causing a stir with his performances at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival .
The title of his debut album , Timez Are Weird These Days is a reference to the tidal wave of fame London found himself riding .
He told Billboard magazine : `` We were in Cannes for like two weeks playing shows , just wilding around a whole new part of the world .
Yachts in those places were playing our music and the people were enjoying it . ''
London premiered this tune during the trailer for the second season of HBO 's How To Make It In America .
`` The song is like post-Osama -LSB- bin Laden -RSB- freedom , '' London explained to Billboard magazine .
`` It 's about not joining no group .
It 's walking into a room , brave , by yourself . ''
