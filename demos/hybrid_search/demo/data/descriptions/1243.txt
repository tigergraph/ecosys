Throughout the summer of 2008 Demi Lovato was touring with the Jonas Brothers and it was no surprise that they hooked up together to write some songs for her album .
She told MTV News about this track : `` I did a duet with the Jonas Brothers on my album , and we wrote the song together .
It 's like a break-up song , and it 's called ` On the Line . '
Just look at how successful they are .
I would love to have their input anytime , because they 're obviously doing something right .
`` Lovato then explained how the brothers helped her : `` I tend to write songs that are , I guess , a little bit more intense and less catchy , and I needed help writing catchy songs .
So that 's where they came in .
I put a lot of my musical input and lyrics into these songs , and they just helped me with hooks and stuff like that . ''
