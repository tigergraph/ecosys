The song originated with View guitarist Pete Reilly trying out a new guitar pedal .
Said singer Kyle Falconer to the NME : `` There was a lot of '80s sounding tracks on the radio at the time we wrote this .
Pete had just got a new guitar pedal and was mucking about with it when he made the intro sound .
We just took it from there and decided to write something that would be fairly instant and radio friendly . ''
Falconer explained the song 's meaning to the NME : `` Lyrically , it 's about how sometimes you love it when a girl comes round to visit you , but the company can get too intense if you spend too much time together .
It 's always good when they leave and you can look forward to seeing them another time .
It 's about the thrill of the chase sometimes being better than the catch , in a roundabout way . ''
