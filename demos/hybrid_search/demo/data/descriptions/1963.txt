The second single from American pop band Cobra Starship 's fourth album Night Shades was recorded with Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic and released in stores and on iTunes on August 30 , 2011 .
Frontman Gabe Saporta jokingly told MTV News the album title comes not only from personal experiences , but is also inspired by the family of flowering plants known as Solanaceae .
`` They 're the family of nightshades , and the flowers of these vegetables only open up at night , which is how I think of myself , '' he laughed .
`` Like , I wake up at 2 in the afternoon , I 'm a vegetable ... until I get to flower at night . ''
