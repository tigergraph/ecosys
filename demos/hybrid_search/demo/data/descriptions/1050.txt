This is a track from The Pop Underground , the debut solo EP by Andrew McMahon , who is the former frontman of pop-rock groups Jack 's Mannequin and Something Corporate .
McMahon told Billboard magazine : `` This song took some conceptual inspiration from One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest .
It 's about stasis and that moment where you decide it just wo n't do , even if that means torching the place . ''
