Frontman Alex Turner discussed this song in an interview with NME : `` There 's always a load of words in our tunes , is n't there .
And I was trying to think of a way of being a bit more economical , so we thought the one way of doing that is having really simple choruses but quite complicated verses lyrically -- and that were one of them .
I mean it 's based on a place that I 've been but I do n't necessarily want that to be what the listener associates it with .
'Cause maybe they can relate it to a place they 've been .
I do n't want to ruin that by giving them a map .
Some great harmonies on this song too .
-LSB- Producer -RSB- James Ford 's favourite bit of this record is on that song .
It goes ` uh-oh-uh-oh-wo . '
Maybe it 's because it sounds like the Klaxons .
I always think he prefers them to us . ''
Drummer Matt Helders explained the song title to NME : `` The hellcat spangled one is n't quite as mad as it sounds .
Alex has always been a storyteller , but I think on the last record he tried to dilute that a bit with some more mystery .
That 's probably carried over .
The hellcat thing , that 's something that somebody has to come up with , it 's not a day-to-day term that everybody uses . ''
Turner sings , `` She 's got a telescopic hallelujah hanging upon her wall / Well did you ever get the feeling that these are things she said before ? ''
Q magazine asked the vocalist if a ` telescopic hallelujah ' is a vibrator ?
He replied : `` No , it 's just a story .
Quite funny , we definitely wanted a few more ... gags . ''
