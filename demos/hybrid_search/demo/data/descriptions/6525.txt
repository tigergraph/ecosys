This is the first TFK song where strings play the musical lead in the verses instead of the guitar , though TFK frontman/songwriter Trevor McNevan commented to NewReleaseTuesday that it , `` is pretty outside the box for us , both musically and vocally , but the essence of it is n't . ''
The phrase `` fly on the wall '' dates back to 1920s America and refers to a hidden observer who can overhear discussions or watch events unnoticed .
One of the first citations of this phrase was in The Oakland Tribune , February 1921 : `` I 'd just love to be a fly on the wall when the Right Man comes along . ''
Some makers of film and television documentaries use a fly-on-the-wall technique , in which they record events as they happen without any artistic direction .
The premise of the hit comedy The Office is that a fly-on-the-wall team are observing life unfold in an office environment .
McNevan explained the song 's meaning to NewReleaseToday : `` This song is about someone speaking to their addictions and written from the point of view of me describing it in a dream .
When I picture us singing this chorus together , speaking to our addictions , mountains and vices , it gives me chills .
It 's the scene in the movie when someone walks out of the darkness into the light . ''
