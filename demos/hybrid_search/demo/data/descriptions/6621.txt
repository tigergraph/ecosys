This was released on December 18 , 2012 as the second promotional single from Indicud .
Despite cracking the Hot 100 , the song then disappeared from the chart the next week due to a lack of airplay .
Cudi 's previous release , `` Just What I Am , '' encountered a similar scenario and the rapper tweeted his frustrations toward his label about their lack of radio promotion .
`` King Wizard 3.4 million views on Vevo , Just What I Am has 4.3 million and my s -- t is not on regular rotation on radio .
Hmmm , '' wrote Cudi .
`` Trinidad James got 4.1 million views on his hit -LRB- rightfully so -RRB- , and I hear that jam EVERYWHERE .
Wheres my fu -- in spins ??? '' The single 's cover art is a self-portrait , which Cudi took with his iPhone .
`` I think its really fu -- in funny ha the lil silly things in life '' , tweeted the rapper .
