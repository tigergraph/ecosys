This is a remake of a Stone Temple Pilot outtake called `` Learning to Drive . ''
`` Happy '' in Galoshes chronicles Weiland 's relationship with his wife Mary Forsberg , whom he married in 2000 and separated from eight years later .
He told Associated Press : `` It 's a concept album of the love lost between she and I .
It chronicles our relationship from the moment that we got married and really , every time there was a separation is when I would come in here and live here basically and just purge . ''
This number featured on the soundtrack for the 2006 William Friedkin movie Bug .
Weiland told Netscape Celebrity : `` The song we wrote is almost perfect for the film because , on one end , it 's beautiful and almost pristine - and on the other side of things , it 's really twisted and it 's like you 're on a psychotic roller coaster ride in slow motion . ''
