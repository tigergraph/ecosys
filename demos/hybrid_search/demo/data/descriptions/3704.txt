This song finds Alison Goldfrapp singing about two male lovers that were brought together by war then separated , permanently .
She told The Idolator that it was inspired by a true story .
`` I found a letter on a website called Letters Of Note , '' Goldfrapp explained .
`` It 's basically a letter from a soldier to another soldier .
They met in -LSB- World War II -RSB- and became lovers , and tragically one of them dies in battle .
So they 're not able to ever resume their love .
This letter is written on the anniversary of the other 's death , and it just moved me so much that it inspired the song . ''
The Civil Wars song `` D'Arline '' from their 2013 eponymous album was inspired by a different letter found on the same website .
