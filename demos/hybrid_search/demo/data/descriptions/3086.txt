Soul Asylum lead singer Dave Pirner wrote this war-themed song .
`` Black Gold '' is oil , and the song deals with the first Gulf War , with the `` Two boys on a playground '' being metaphors for USA and Iraq .
Midway through the song there are some sounds of sirens , screams and what appears to be a news report .
When we spoke with Pirner in 2013 , he explained : `` Here 's a song that I wrote 20 years ago that was begging people to grow up , and I guess it does n't happen .
People just try to stay the way they are , and that 's unfortunate .
To that effect , I just keep on singing the song .
The song does not present an answer , but I think that it 's something that people need to be reminded of . ''
Directed by David Roth , the video for this song featured George Wendt , who played Norm in the TV series Cheers .
The video got the band on MTV , and the network took a liking to the band .
This encouraged their record company to attach a big budget to their next video , which was the `` missing children '' clip for `` Runaway Train , '' which became an MTV favorite .
Political songs do n't always have very long shelf lives , but this one has remained in Soul Asylum 's set list , as it remains relevant .
`` I had no idea how adaptable this song was , '' Dave Pirner told us .
`` It can be interpreted as something that 's more micro and macro .
I tend to take these things from a personal point of view where it 's two boys on a playground , and at the time it was an obvious reference to political leaders going , ` My dick is bigger than yours . ' ''
