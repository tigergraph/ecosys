The Chevrolet El Camino , last made in 1987 , is a classic American car perfect for cruising around looking for fun .
In this song , Elizabeth Cook sings about a less-than-desirable guy driving a 1972 model .
In an interview with Dan MacIntosh , she explained : `` It was a very easy song to write .
It was one of those , sort of , 30-minute moments , where it all came out in the order it is on the song .
I was sitting in a park in East Nashville , and realized there were a lot of people out there sort of cruising around , checking each other out and stuff .
It really surprised me that that was going on .
It was a creepy scene , with a lot of funky cars and stuff and I just started with that first line -LRB- ' I know this guy , he 's all wrong for me ' -RRB- and it all came exactly like in a record .
`` And for the record , she has dated a guy with a mullet -LRB- `` Right now my hands are in his mullet '' -RRB- .
Cook is a Country singer/songwriter whose parents were musicians , but not like The Osmonds - they would put her on a bar stool while they would perform at various honky-tonks .
She released her first album in 2000 , and gained a following at the Grand Ole Opry .
Her Welder album was produced by Don Was , who has worked on albums by The Rolling Stones , Bonnie Raitt and The B-52 's .
Said Cook : `` He was amazing to work with !
He 's very experienced .
He was very trusting of me , and he did n't really tell me what to do .
It 's my 5th album , so I 've kind of got an idea what I 'm doing .
He let that happen , and just sort of oversaw the process and made sure we did n't screw up . ''
