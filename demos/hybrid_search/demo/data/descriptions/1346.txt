This melancholy ballad is the second single from Country music artist Dierks Bentley 's fifth studio album , Up on the Ridge .
The song was written by Bentley and his buddy John Randall Stewart , who also produced the album .
Stewart told The Boot the story behind this song : `` We were just throwing around some ideas and I ca n't remember how we came up with the words ` draw me a map that leads me back to you ' at first ... maybe we were talking about traveling , I do n't know .
But we approached it from this groove that we both really love , it 's by that band the Shins ... it 's almost a bluegrass groove , but it 's the way that that acoustic drives that whole track , and we started playing around with that .
We needed something in that slot on this record , we did n't have anything like it .
So we just started playing with these melody ideas , and Dierks threw out the first line and , there you go , you just start writing .
It 's kind of like we wrote ourselves into that chorus .
And it sounds like Dierks.That line could be funny , really , but when you put it in a serious context and make a love song out of it , it 's pretty strong .
I think it works from both sides , too .
I think guys really relate to that , that , ` Hey , what did I do ?
I do n't even know what I just said ? '
But I think women want to hear that , too .
They want to know that you 're trying .
What I like about it is most ideas have already been written .
But I had n't necessarily heard this idea before .
Maybe it has been done before , and I 'm sure someone 's approached it , but I thought it was a really different angle for a song . ''
The song features harmonies from multiple Grammy-winning Bluegrass-Country singer Alison Krauss .
She is best known to many for her collaboration album with Robert Plant , Raising Sand .
