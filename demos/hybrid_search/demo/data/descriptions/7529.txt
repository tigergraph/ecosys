Pixie penned this song with LA-based writer CJ Baran , a friend of Perez Hilton .
The blogger was an early champion of Pixie in the US , and suggested the pair work together .
Baran was once a member of boy band Push Play and his experience of pop music is matched by the song 's third writer , James Bourne , formerly of mid 2000s teen faves Busted .
The below-the-radar collaboration resulted in a more impassioned , soulful sound than Pixie is generally known for .
`` I grew up listening to a lot of soul , '' she said .
`` And on the first album there 's a lot of kinda sweet pop tunes .
But on this album , alongside the happy , uplifting songs , I wanted to explore more soulful sounds -- and it 's like I get to sing more on those songs . ''
Pixie initially kept the collaboration a secret , `` We set up a day in a studio in London on one of my days off -- we did n't even tell the label , '' she grinned .
