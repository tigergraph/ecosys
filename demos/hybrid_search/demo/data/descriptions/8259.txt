Louisiana born singer-songwriter Marc Broussard told Artist Direct the story behind this song : `` I was in Los Angeles , and I was doing a writing session with a couple different guys .
We were having trouble getting things done naturally .
We were having some difficulty making it all happen lyrically for that song .
The melody was great , and the music was great , but we just could n't make the lyrics happen .
So I called a great writer friend of mine , Marshall Altman .
I called him up and said , ` Hey buddy , come over to the studio . '
So he came and helped us move things along quite rapidly .
It 's a beautiful song .
I love it . ''
