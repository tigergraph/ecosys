This song about the fragility of life was written about a friend of Tunstall 's , who suddenly died from pancreatic cancer aged only 34 .
Just before he died he 'd gifted her a cut-glass vase .
The irony hit home afterwards .
`` I was like , you absolute bastard ! ''
she laughed .
`` The one thing I 've got that you 've given me is the most breakable thing I own . ''
This features a whistling contribution from American multi-instrumentalist Andrew Bird .
Tunstall told The Sun : `` I was over the moon he was up for getting involved .
He came through town for a show and we grabbed him for an hour or two in the afternoon .
I 'd seen him play in New York a couple of years earlier and was blown away by his skill . ''
