This is the second single by R&B singer Usher , from his EP Versus .
The song was written by Ester Dean , produced by Polow Da Don and features rapper Jay-Z and R&B singer Ciara .
A hot toddy is a mixed drink , usually including alcohol that is served hot .
Hot toddies are traditionally drunk before going to bed , or in cold weather .
Uses of the phrase in popular music as a slang term for a hot girl can be dated back to at least 1942 when Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby sung Irving Berlin 's `` I 'll Capture Your Heart in Holiday Inn : -LSB- Astaire :] Here she comes , down the street -LSB- Crosby :] My , oh my , ai n't she sweet ?
-LSB- Astaire :] Why , here comes my hot toddy -LSB- Crosby :] Over my dead body .
In Jay-Z 's verse he raps , `` Big ballin is my hobby / So much so they think I 'm down with the Illuminati . ''
This a reference to the video for Hov 's track `` On to the Next One , '' which was alleged to feature Satanic , Masonic and Illuminati imagery .
The rapper later shot down the claims on the Rick Ross track `` Free Mason . ''
The song was originally reported to feature Ciara .
However , when the official mix of the song appeared online , Ester Dean , who sung vocals on the demo of the track , can be heard singing the vocal female interludes .
The songwriter told The Boombox that she was surprised when she heard the finished product .
`` Usher is a real good friend of mine , '' said Dean .
`` I went to Jamaica with him and the guys .
We are out there hanging out and one his boys ask me , ` You heard Usher 's new song ` Hot Tottie ? '
And I had never heard of that song before .
I knew we recorded some stuff with Usher , but that was all .
I did n't even know Jay-Z was on it and I did n't know my vocals were going to make the track .
To tell you the truth , I did n't even remember recording the song -LSB- laughs -RSB- . ''
