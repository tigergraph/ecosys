This is a track from English electronic artist Just Jack -LRB- real name Jack Allsopp -RRB- 's third studio album All Night Cinema .
All Night Cinema is drenched in a richer , more detailed sound Allsopp told The Independent August 28 , 2009 , that he was particularly chuffed that on this song , he has received his first solo production credit .
He said : `` I was listening to my own demos and other people 's , and I realised a lot of the excitement gets polished out .
It 's very hard to retain that .
If you get the right balance of things pushing and pulling , it 's more interesting than things being so machine-like .
I 've moved away from that and back towards human errors . ''
