This song is about the media and how sometimes it brainwashing people into resorting to violence .
This is evident in the lines , `` You and me should go outside and beat 'em beat 'em beat 'em beat 'em beat 'em beat 'em '' and , `` Realize you 're blind , and we 're out of time , it will show your mind . ''
One of the shorter System Of A Down songs , this one runs 2:54 .
