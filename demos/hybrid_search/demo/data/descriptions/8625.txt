This was one of two songs on Back When I Knew It All that Eddie Montgomery co-wrote .
His other co-writing credit was for `` God Knows Who I Am . ''
Montgomery penned this with former One Trick Pony bass player Ira Dean and Kim Tribble .
In an interview with Christian Lamitschka of the Dutch website Bullit Country Info , Montgomery described this as , `` a good ol' party song talkin ' about that one guy that we all know that cuts up most of the bar . ''
