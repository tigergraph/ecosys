Keyshia Cole told MTV News about this track : `` I 'm explaining how I 'm just like you ; I go through everyday things , I 'm trying to get my things together just like you , I 'm trying to learn myself , just like you , you know .
Everything that we go through on a regular day , just trying to get ourselves together and slowly gravitate to the goals and aspirations we have in life , and I think when it comes to that aspect , I 'm just like anybody else . ''
