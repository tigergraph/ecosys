White wrote this for the 2009 electric guitar documentary It Might Get Loud .
The White Stripes/Raconteurs guitarist penned and recorded the song in just ten minutes , with the film crew witnessing the song 's entire genesis and completion .
This might be the best modern song to have ever been written just to win an argument .
Director Davis Guggenheim -LRB- who also directed An Inconvenient Truth -RRB- disagreed with White when White made the statement that most songs nowadays are over-prepared and over-produced .
White improvised this on the spot just to prove his point.By the way , deliberately under-producing songs is also one of the hallmarks of the punk rock movement .
Garage rock , which will always be the close cousin of punk , shares this ideology .
The argument goes that polishing and perfecting music , such as is done with progressive rock , may make it technically better , but at the price of sacrificing the passion and soul out of music.For another feat of speed-song-writing , see Leiber & Stoller 's `` Santa Claus Is Back in Town , '' written for Elvis Presley in just fifteen minutes while his manager , `` Colonel '' Tom Parker , glowered at them for taking too long .
This was Jack White 's first ever solo single .
