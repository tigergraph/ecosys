William II -LRB- c. 1056 -- 2 August 1100 -RRB- was the third son of William I of England -LRB- better known as William the Conqueror - the Norman King who invaded England in 1066 -RRB- .
In the aftermath of the Norman invasion , many people had their land confiscated by the crown and turned into royal hunting grounds .
This unsurprisingly caused a lot of resentment .
William succeeded his father to the throne in 1087 and thirteen years later he was killed in a hunting accident in one of these new hunting grounds , The New Forest .
There is a legend , which claims that the king died because locals had placed a curse on him for stealing their land .
English singer-songwriter Frank Turner told Drankin ' and Smokin ' why he penned a song for his fourth album England Keep My Bones about the incident .
He explained : `` I 'm from near the New Forest , that 's kind of where I grew up and , because I 'm literally the coolest person you 've ever met , I was reading up on some books about local folk lore and myths and legend and that kind of thing and I found this story about ` The Blacksmith 's Curse ' and the death of King William II .
It was just one of those things that the minute I read it I was just like ` man , I am going to use that in a song ' .
Then it just sort of came together , so , there it is . ''
The historical a cappella sounds like a traditional song - but is n't .
Turner told Drankin ' and Smokin ' : `` Stylistically , it 's very much written to sound like a traditional .
But it is n't one -- I wrote the melody myself .
But then , at the same time , it 's using a scale that a lot of traditional English songs do use , and then just little things like repeating the first verse at the end like pretty much all traditional songs use .
It 's kind of written to sound like that . ''
