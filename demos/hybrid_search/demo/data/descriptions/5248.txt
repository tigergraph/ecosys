This atmospheric song was inspired by a mountain climbing adventure Mount Eerie 's Phil Elverum embarked on up Mount Baker , which is in his home state of Washington .
In our interview with Elverum , he explained : `` It 's the only actual alpine legitimate mountain climbing trip I 've been on with ice picks and ropes and stuff .
And I was just thinking about the absurdity of that endeavor , like getting to the top of the mountain and seeing , well , this is here .
And then the world keeps going up above us .
Like , there 's more space . ''
Phil Elverum has no idea why he chose the name Mount Eerie for his solo project , and that mystery is reflected in this song .
He told us : `` I 'm constantly thinking , What does this band name mean ?
Which is kind of why I have this name , because there 's something to it that I do n't quite understand , so I keep making up these songs to try to explain this ambiguous concept .
It 's kind of like a looming mountain above the world , invisible . ''
