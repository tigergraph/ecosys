Though best known as an Electropop band , this track showed Hot Chip 's rockier side .
Joe Goddard -LRB- vocals , synthesizer and percussion -RRB- explained to the Sun newspaper February 1 , 2008 : `` Being a real live band is something we 've always tried to do .
We 've always had live electric guitar and piano as well as drum machines and synthesizers which people associate with dance music .
We have small elements which are computer-controlled but very little of it .
It 's the most fun bit , playing together like a real band , and something we 're proud of . ''
Animators/illustrators Bevis Martin and Charlie Youle created the song 's animated video .
The duo told the Hot Chip website how they got involved in making the promo : `` We have known the band for a long time -LRB- Bevis is Felix 's brother -RRB- and we have worked on various things for them - T-shirts , record covers , photographs and so on .
They let us know that proposals for a video were being looked at and that we should send in any ideas , so we gave them a rough outline of what we wanted to do and they liked it .
`` They were then asked how they came up with their ideas for it .
The duo replied : `` We listened to the song a lot and let it work on our brains , and we thought about the character of the group and what sort of visual `` world '' the song evokes - a mix of cartoon-like exuberance , hand-made Africana , and nostalgic futurism - something bright , bold , and slightly off-kilter .
