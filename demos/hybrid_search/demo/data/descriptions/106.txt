This poignant ballad was written after a drunken phone call The Script 's Danny O'Donoghue made to his girlfriend after they split up .
He explained to The Sun September 3 , 2010 : `` I was heartbroken and the last thing I needed was to be taken out for a drink .
I ended up making a fool of myself by calling her when I was in such a state . ''
Guitarist Mark Sheehan explained the song 's meaning in an interview with AOL Music : `` It 's really about drunk dialing , which is something that everyone does .
We laugh and we say it from stage every night , ` Raise your hand if you drunk dial . '
And when we first ask them , a few people kind of put their hands up , but by the end of the song when you ask them again , ` Are you going to be f -- ing honest now ? '
and everybody puts their hands up .
And that 's what that song is quite literally about : piecing together a bad night the next day . ''
