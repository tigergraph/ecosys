I was like , what is he singing !
And I ran out of the dressing room -- I looked like a hot mess !
I was in the middle of getting my hair and make-up done .
He had just surprised the audience with a new song .
He came off the stage and I was like , you need to write me a song like that !
And instead , he gave me that song so I could have it on my album .
It 's a very relatable song to me . ''
