This introspective rocker finds Doug Robb singing such psyche-bearing lines as , `` How 'd I fall so far no one can find me ? ''
and `` My ambition is a curse , because it hides the best in me but shows the worst . ''
`` That song is based on certain emotions that myself and other members of the band have gone through in terms of dealing with the ups and downs we 've experienced , '' he explained .
`` It 's about being obsessed with your career and the jeopardy that puts on your personal life - relationships lost and opportunities missed .
The song taps into all of those feelings .
It 's not about a specific situation as much as part of an ongoing struggle : does this career define me ?
The answer is that , although music and my career are a huge part of who I am , they 're not everything I am .
And this song falls right before that realization.As it happened , I wrote the lyric while Charlie Sheen was losing it in public - not that it 's specifically about him by any means , but we did n't have to look too far outside of our own lives to see it happening to other people .
So in that sense it reinforced the theme as I was writing it . ''
