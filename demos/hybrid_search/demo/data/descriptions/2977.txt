We have Beach Boys guitarist Carl Wison and their manager at the time , Jack Rieley , to thank for this ethereal song packed with lyrics like `` Encasing all embracing wreath of repose . ''
While his brother Brian Wilson wrote most of The Beach Boys classics , Carl had a big part in the Surf 's Up , doing a lot of production work on the album and also co-writing `` Long Promised Road '' with Rieley - Carl sang lead on both tracks as well .
Explaining the spiritual nature of his songs , Carl said , `` We believe in God as universal consciousness .
God is love , God is you , God is me , God is everything here in this room . ''
This was used over the closing credits of Cameron Crowe 's movie Almost Famous .
-LRB- thanks , Daniel - Hamilton , New Zealand -RRB- The mellow vibe of this song lent itself to surf culture , which the album was clearly going for .
The song was used in the 1972 surfing movie Five Summer Stories .
