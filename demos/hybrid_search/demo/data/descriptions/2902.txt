This song is a collaboration with Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood of Lady Antebellum .
Lambert explained : `` Lady Antebellum 's Charles and Dave came down to Blake -LRB- Shelton -RRB- 's farm last year .
We 're really country and all we do at home is drive back roads or fish or have a fire .
So we did all that , but we wrote too .
They stayed for two days , and we wrote four songs .
I would never think a song called ` Love Song ' would be on my record because I just do n't sing songs like that .
But this song is about just knowing each other .
My favorite part is the bridge .
It says ` Everybody always sings about it/how they 're never gon na live without it/But we do n't have to talk about it/Because we 're living it out . '
To me that wraps up the whole song .
It 's not this fairy tale , bubblegum , happy , everybody 's in love song .
It 's just about two real people .
And Charles sings on it , which is unbelievable .
It 's so different for me .
I guess I 've reached a point where it 's all right to maybe love somebody . ''
