This song is about when Chevelle bass player Joe Loeffler left the band .
He is the brother of Pete and Sam Loeffler , who were founding members of the band .
Since Joe was not just a band member but also family , this made his departure more complicated .
Although he decided to quit , they are not mad , but this is more of a warning for Joe 's safety .
