Musically this song was inspired by a track from Smashing Pumpkins ' classic 1995 album , Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness .
TFK frontman/songwriter Trevor McNevan explained to NewReleaseTuesday : `` I 'm a big 90 's fan , and I remember somewhere in the middle of writing this record wanting to create something that moved like that old classic song ` Zero ' by Smashing Pumpkins ; something that just had ` eat you alive ' guitars in it , and was heavy , but danceable .
The verses in this song and the main riff make you want to move - they have that funky element to them . ''
The End Is Where We Begin has a militant theme running through it , which McNevan told NewReleaseTuesday , `` was part of the inspiration in conveying what I was feeling mentally and spiritually . ''
He added : `` This song is a forerunner for that , setting the pace and laying out the foundation for the heart of this record .
I think the lyrics of the chorus say it all : ` We are the change , we are the chains that hold us , ' conveying that it 's up to us to be the change .
We ca n't wait for someone else to do it - we are our own prison . ''
