Reeves explained the meaning of `` Helium '' to AntiMusic : `` This song is a fairytale set on fire .
It is a daydream lit by the brightest sunbeam on earth .
And I was madly in love with at least the idea of love when I wrote it , seen hiding in the eyes of the ghost of a gorgeous girl .
I always write when I 'm burning alive .
Whether it 's in pain or bliss or bewildered confusion .
The idea of having helium hearts is a very simple but hopefully powerful metaphor for the way falling in love seems to lift us up and away from the madness of this world .
To a place where everything is as surreal and mysterious as it ever could be .
It 's as if we 're floating up into the sky away from a city that is being engulfed in silence by flames.We 're looking down at the beautiful chaos and disintegration knowing that we figured out how to escape .
Just barely in the last possible perfect moment .
And I hope for this song to give people that feeling of floating up towards a light and away from any sort of darkness .
Every song is real and is inspired directly from the most tumultuous and fragile of all my emotions .
My songs are rare survivors from a battlefield that changes every war .
They are gifts found drifting on the wandering wind .
And I feel like I 'm only reflected in the pool of each one of them like an illusion that could be lost .
This song is for love and its miraculous potential to heal and save and revive our hearts again and again . ''
