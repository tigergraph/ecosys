This song was inspired by the pain Hayley Williams felt following the departure of the Farro brothers from the band .
`` There were moments over the last year and a half that I really was just hanging by a thread , '' she said .
`` I felt like my purpose was gone .
The song is about how I crawled out of it . ''
