Keinan ` K'naan ' Warsame was born in Somalia and spent his childhood in Mogadishu , living there during the Somali Civil War , which began in 1991 .
K'naan 's grandfather , Haji Mohammad , was a poet and his aunt , Magool , one of Somalia 's most famous singers .
The young Somalian acquired an early interest in Hip-Hop from the records that were sent to him from America by his father .
K'naan describes growing up in Somalia amidst the ongoing warfare in this song .
`` I came out of a killer / Neighborhood called River / Where life expectancy is shorter than a caterpillar / I was once a gorilla / Mogadishu was my cage / My trainer was the gauge , '' he raps .
When he was 13 , K'naan , his mother , and his three siblings left their homeland and joined relatives in New York City , where they stayed briefly before moving to the Toronto neighborhood of Rexdale where there was a large Somali community .
K'naan says in this song that his upbringing was nothing compared to the life of the King of Zamunda - the character portrayed in the 1988 film Coming To America - his early years were `` too gory . ''
