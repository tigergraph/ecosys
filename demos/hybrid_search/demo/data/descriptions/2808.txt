Frontman Jon Fratelli told The Sunday Mail May 4 , 2008 about this piano-driven epic : `` There is a lot of piano on the album and this started it .
I wrote it on a video shoot in the States and could not wait to get home to the piano .
It 's probably my favorite song on the album and people really like it live .
I think it will be huge and it had a big influence on the rest of the record .
It let me see where the album could go . ''
Jon Fratelli added in an interview with the Daily Mail June 6 , 2008 : `` I did n't sit down to write a mini-opera , but I love songs that cram a lot of ideas into a short space of time . ''
