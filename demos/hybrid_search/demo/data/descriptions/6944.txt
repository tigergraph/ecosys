Dunn penned this song during a period when he was making a lot of changes in his life without much input whilst manically penning a stream of songs for his debut solo album .
His wife , Janine , sat him down and asked Ronnie to take a deep breath and chart his course forward more thoughtfully .
`` And she said , ` Quit writing . '
She never said that before , so I agreed , '' Dunn told The Associated Press 's Chris Talbott .
`` And as soon as she turned the corner to go back to the bedroom I just dove for a pencil and paper and I wrote this song , ` Last Love I 'm Trying . '
In the back of her mind , she 's thinking maybe she 's going to be one of those impulsive moves and I 'm going to exit the premises . ''
