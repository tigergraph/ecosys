This collaboration between New York indie rockers the National and their fellow Brooklyn singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten was written for the Tom McCarthy-directed sports comedy-drama movie Win Win .
The song is played during its closing credits and was the first tune that The National had written specifically for a film .
`` We knew he was a serious director , '' frontman Matt Berninger told HitFix , mentioning that he enjoyed McCarthy 's directorial debut Station Agent and The Visitor.He added that the material of Win Win was `` just the kind of thing our music would work well for .
It 's about very normal and good people trying to do their best and the struggle to be good . ''
Matt Berninger told Spinner about the song 's music video : `` Tom McCarthy and my brother Tom collaborated from afar while we were on tour in Europe and McCarthy was on his own press tour .
Rather than try to tell the narrative of either the film , or the song , we thought it would be better just to show the spirit of collaboration that went into both .
McCarthy pulled together some of his favorite out-takes and my brother , along with our lighting director Michael Brown , filmed us playing the song on stage in Helsinki during sound check .
Tom McCarthy and his team wove it all together back in New York the night before the film premiered . ''
