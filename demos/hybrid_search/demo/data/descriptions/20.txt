This song is about a fisherman who always wanted to fish and later dies while returning his catch to a small community where it is implied that he is very popular .
Les Claypool , who is a fisherman himself , claims the story is true .
The song enjoyed some success and got Primus a major label deal .
This was featured on the video game Guitar Hero II .
