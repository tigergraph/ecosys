This could be telling the Greek myth of the sea creatures `` Scylla '' and `` Charybdis '' in which Charybdis layed on a narrow channel of water , and on the other side was Scylla .
It is told that the distance between both sea monsters were an arrows length of each other and sailors trying to avoid Scylla would get too close to Charybdis and vice versa .
Charybdis swallows large quantities of water three times a day before belching them back out causing whirlpools .
Scylla has six long necks with heads , each head with three rows of sharp teeth and it 's body has 12 canine legs and a cat 's tail .
From the song title , it means to a state when one meets two dangers and moving away from one will bring you closer to the other .
The second verse talks of encountering Charybdis -LRB- `` Walls of carnage surround your weakness , '' `` Crash down like oceans , wait for the light '' , etc. -RRB- and the third verse talks of Scylla -LRB- `` Life 's a battle , perpetual crusade , '' `` One against all , tim to wield the blade '' , etc. -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , Nick - Cairns , Australia -RRB- Scylla And Charybdis show up in the Police song `` Wrapped Around Your Finger '' with the line : `` Caught between Scylla and Charibdes . ''
