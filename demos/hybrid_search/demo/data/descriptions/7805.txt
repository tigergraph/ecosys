This song finds Robbie examining his own addictive tendencies in a similar fashion to several of his past tunes such as `` Come Undone . ''
He told music streaming service Spotify how he took inspiration from Bob Dylan for this track : `` That 's me trying to channel Bob Dylan .
I 'm not saying I got anywhere near it at all .
I 'm just saying I tried to do it !
, '' he said . '' '
I feel my energy , justify some company , darling , everything I like is illegal , seductive , addictive in my world , corrosive , destructive ... ' It 's flag-waving , rampart-standing , stadium-menacing , stadium-bothering song .
I do n't really know what it is . ''
