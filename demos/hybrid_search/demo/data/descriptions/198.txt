This vulnerable Dubstep ballad finds Rihanna pouring her heart out .
She penned the tune with British singer-songwriter Livvi Franc , who like the `` Diamonds '' star is of Barbadian heritage .
Franc 's other credits include Kelly Clarkson 's `` The War Is Over '' and Britney Spears ' `` Trouble For Me '' as well as her own single , `` Now I 'm That Bitch '' which topped the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart and was a top 40 hit in New Zealand and the UK .
The song 's haunting music video was filmed in a warehouse in Thailand and finds the Bajan singer locked in a white room .
`` It 's ... eerie - kind of creepy , '' Rihanna said of the clip .
`` It could almost be expected .
Everybody is probably expecting a narrative type of video - a love story of some sort .
Something really soft and pretty .
It is pretty and kind of soft , but it 's really a little demented . ''
