This is one of three new songs on R.E.M. 's compilation album , Part Lies , Part Heart , Part Truth , Part Garbage 1982 -- 2011 , which was released after the band announced they were disbanding .
Bassist Mike Mills told Spinner that they `` are three of the facets of R.E.M. , musically speaking . ''
He explained : `` They all address , in one way or another , the disbanding of R.E.M. but from three different points of view . '
A Month Of Saturdays ' is kind of a silly , goofy fun song .
` We all Go Back to Where We Belong ' is a beautiful wistful mid-tempo ballad that we all like to write .
And then ` Hallelujah ' is a heavier , more poignant song . ''
