Yamkela was a street kid that Blindside 's lead vocalist Christian Lindskog befriended during a mission trip to South Africa .
Lindskog told musicomh.com : `` My lyrics have to be personal to me and connected , there has to be a real emotional attachment , and as such I tend to write about what I 'm going through at a given time .
Yamkela for instance was written about a 10-year old boy I met in South Africa while accompanying my wife on a research trip last year .
He was living on the street , his father was not around , his house had burnt down and his mother died of HIV .
He had the AIDS virus too , but despite all of that he was full of joy and happiness .
Amongst all that suffering and pain he was able to be happy and enjoy life .
So that really hit home to me and put things in perspective in a big way . ''
