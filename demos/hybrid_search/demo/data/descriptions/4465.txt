This is the closest thing to a ballad on the American Capitalist album .
Guitarist Jason Hook explained to Loudwire that it was something he worked on with drummer Jeremy Spencer as the band 's main songwriter , Zoltan Bathory , `` is n't really a ballad guy . ''
They played it for Bathory then `` tweaked it all together . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Emile Levisetti , who has also worked on the hit television show Bones .
It was shot in Los Angeles over a span of three days in early February 2012 .
Vocalist Ivan Moody told Noisecreep why the band went for a plot driven narrative , in which they merely appear in cameo roles .
`` When we first developed the concept for ` Remember Everything , ' we decided we did n't want the band performing in the video , '' he explained .
`` There are far too many ego shots of musicians these days playing their instruments in the desert , or churches or random places , that really have nothing to do with the song itself .
`` He continued , `` We wanted this video to be more about the lyrics , emotion and mood of the actual piece and not about us , the band .
I think it turned out stellar . ''
Hook told Loudwire that vocalist Ivan Moody 's poignant lyrics , `` talks about his upbringing and his childhood . ''
