Brad Paisley penned `` Nobody 's Fool '' for the 2011 computer animated movie , Cars 2 .
The movie 's storyline has race car Lightning McQueen and tow truck Mater competing overseas in the first World Grand Prix and this song represented a change for the Country singer-songwriter .
`` It 's me doing more of an Eric Clapton-type blues ballad about the saddest part in the film , when Mater realizes that since people think he 's playing the part of a fool , he is a fool , '' Paisley told Reuters .
`` But Mater also realizes that 's just who he is , and that was inspiring to me . ''
