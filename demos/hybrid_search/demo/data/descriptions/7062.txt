This Country duet with Nashville-based singer Elizabeth Cook finds Steve pondering some past lost opportunities .
`` I usually write about when I was a bum , '' he told The Independent , `` but this one was more thoughtful .
It 's about regrets and maybe missed things .
I was alone and a little bit drunk and my wife was n't there . ''
Steve explained the song title to The Independent : `` I was riding a big ol' Harley Davison through the desert in Texas , '' he recalled .
`` I think it was in April 1977 and everything was going into flower and it turned purple .
It was a gentle thing , but kinda lonesome too , you know ? ''
