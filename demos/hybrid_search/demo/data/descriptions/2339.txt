The Beatles recorded this in 2 sections that were then edited together .
Joe Cocker covered this .
He had a # 1 hit with his version of The Beatles `` A Little Help From My Friends '' 4 years later .
There is an extra verse on US album version .
This was intended for the Beatles film A Hard Day 's Night , but it was replaced by `` Ca n't Buy Me Love . ''
