This song is about fighting with a loved one , and how when you are fighting with someone you become a different person -LRB- `` We speak in different voices '' -RRB- even though you love them .
It is also about losing trust -LRB- `` And you 're waiting for your body 's re-entry '' -RRB- as if the person does n't trust you after the things you 've done or said .
When you fight you do n't want to say things that distance yourself from this person until the differences are impossible to deal with .
-LRB- thanks , kevinrocks409 - Philadelphia , PA -RRB-
