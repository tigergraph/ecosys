Rucker co-wrote this track about a family man trying to squeeze in a little romance between the household chores with his friend , the Country singer-songwriter Radney Foster .
The former Hootie & The Blowfish singer told The Boot about their collaboration : `` Radney and I were writing one day .
We wrote one song , and then we started ` Might Get Lucky , ' '' he recounted .
`` We got through the verse and the chorus , and then he went in and finished it .
Radney demoed it , and you know how big of a Radney fan I am .
Radney does n't just demo it with vocals and guitar ; he whole-band demos it !
-LSB- laughs -RSB- I 'm not kidding !
I 'm telling you , I kept listening to this thing four or five times a day because it 's such a great demo .
When we went into the studio to record it , I kept wanting to sing it like Radney had , because I heard that demo for so long .
I loved all the little phrasings he did and that Texas twang that he 's got . ''
The album title is a play on another album name , Del Rio , TX 1959 by Radney Foster , which noted the Country artist 's birthplace and birth year .
`` Before I named the album Charleston , SC 1966 , I called Rad and told him what I was doing and why I wanted to do it , '' Rucker explained to The Boot .
`` I wanted to make sure he was cool with it .
I think he liked it . ''
