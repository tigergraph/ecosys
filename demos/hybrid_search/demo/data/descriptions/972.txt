This was written by Sandi Thom together with her boyfriend and keyboardist Jake Field .
Sandi Thom recorded this in just one take in the basement of her Tooting , London , apartment .
She explained on her record label 's website : `` I was really hung over that day , but it was alright because I was in my own house .
So I just sat on a chair , falling asleep and just sang it .
For me it was one of the best things I 'd ever done , even if it was a bit husky or whatever , just because I was so relaxed . ''
