Patty Griffin sings here of finally letting go of her delayed adolescence .
She explained to The Daily Telegraph : `` I went to work right away when I was 18 when a lot of people in America go to college to hang out and party for four years .
I went to work and got married really young so never really had wild adolescent times .
So , sometime in my mid-thirties , I thought I would start doing that and then I realised I was getting too old for that and told myself it was time to grow up .
It 's what ` That Kind of Lonely ' is about and it 's a song I tweaked for a long time . ''
Griffin describes the song as occurring at a `` kind of warned over party '' where she is finally able to stop being a kid and decides to grow up .
In the opening lines of the song , she discusses how her heart has turned a corner and every room is in disorder .
While much of the American Kid album is about death and dealing with a loss , this song hits on themes of change and growing up .
