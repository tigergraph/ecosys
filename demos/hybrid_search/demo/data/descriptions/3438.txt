Kramer told Radio.com that rather than take every song pitched to her , she has to relate to it firsthand .
Case in point : this Jerry Flowers , Kelley Lovelace and Rachel Proctor penned tune , which she thought was perfect the moment she first heard it .
`` I never want to be too mean with my songs , but with ' I Hope It Rains , ' it was definitely somewhere in the middle with being sassy and then also a little class in there as well , '' she said .
`` It was a good blend for me and who I want to be perceived as an artist .
With that song , it says everything I want .
The guy knows that I want his days to be ruined , but in a nicer way . ''
