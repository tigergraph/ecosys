This is a semi-autobiographical account of Fiasco 's rise to fame and the insecurities that linger behind modern celebrity culture .
It is described on Fiasco 's website as a `` comment on his own rise to fame , an issue that clearly causes discomfort . ''
This features American singer-songwriter Matthew Santos singing the chorus .
Santos also appeared on the track `` American Terrorist '' from Fiasco 's first album and guested on 3 other tracks on Lupe Fiasco 's The Cool .
The black leather jacket Fiasco wears in the video was created by Los Angeles based designer Dr. Romanelli specifically for the promo .
Ilikemusic.com asked Fiasco where he wrote his music .
The Chicago rapper replied : `` Wherever it is , the music has to be around me .
I have to be kind of buried in the music .
I have to have my headphones on so I ca n't hear anything else , or in the studio it has to be loud .
Like in my car , I have to hear nothing but the music .
Normally it 's the places where I feel most comfortable about writing something .
I find that certain environments help determine what kind of music I will write .
For example , if I want to write something that 's super-lyrical I 'll go in my car . ''
This became the highest charting single by the Chicago rapper under his own name in both the US and UK .
He 'd previously peaked at # 79 in the US and # 27 in the UK in 2006 with `` Kick , Push '' and # 25 in the UK with `` Daydreamin '' the same year .
Fiasco 's only other appearance in the singles charts prior to this song had been as the guest star on Kanye West 's `` Touch The Sky , '' a # 42 hit in the US and # 6 in the UK , again in 2006 .
The video was directed by Hype Williams , a top director for R&B and Rap promos .
Among the many other videos Williams has directed have been `` Check On It '' by Beyonc√© , which won best R&B Video at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards , the $ 2.4 million budgeted `` What 's It Gon na Be '' by Busta Rhymes featuring Janet Jackson and Kanye West 's `` Stronger , '' which was shot in Japan over 9 days .
The Sun newspaper January 18 , 2008 asked Fiasco about the message behind this song .
Fiasco replied : `` It 's an acknowledgment of talent and everything that comes with fame .
I 'm not big into the whole celebrity thing but I can understand how it 's easy to fall into it .
It 's autobiographical . ''
