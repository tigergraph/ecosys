This track was originally recorded by little known Austin , Texas group Milton Mapes .
It was included on 2003 's Westernaire , a showcase for Greg Vanderpool 's songs .
Plant told Mojo : `` That 's the only one I did n't happen upon myself , it was recommended by a friend .
What a lyric !
I wanted to sing it a different way .
A spectacular song . ''
In 2006 British rock group The Broken Family Band recorded a track , `` For Milton Mapes . ''
Despite its title , according to Steve Adams of BFH , the song is not about the Austin group .
He told us : `` We thought that song sounded a little bit like them , and we were trying to sound a bit like them . ''
