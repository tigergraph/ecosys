This song was inspired by Where The Bodies Are Buried , a 2011 novel by the Scottish writer Chris Brookmyre .
Frontman Scott Hutchison explained to The Skinny magazine : `` I took this idea and threaded it into a song about unpleasant secrets in a more general sense .
Infidelity , mistakes , wrong-doings .
These things are never really gone , no matter how far down you bury them .
They 're always lurking , even when you yourself are dead .
`` He added that the track introduces to the Pedestrian Verse album its `` fairly prominent metaphor of death . ''
