Kid Rock penned this tune as a soundtrack for the serving military men and woman as they undertake their dangerous daily routines .
`` I wanted it to be an anthem , something for the guys to get pumped up to when they 've got to go out and do these horrendous jobs , '' Rock told MTV News .
`` There 's been several songs written , some of them are a little sappy , but all very poignant ... but , from being there so many times , I 've heard the stuff they listen to when they 're out there , blaring stuff from their Humvees , when they 're driving around on these missions ... and I said , ` Man , let 's try to make them a theme song , to get them pumped up . '
`` We wanted to keep it very truthful , but heavy and hard , and hopefully It 's something that will help them get psyched up when they have to do their job , '' he continued .
`` I was almost thinking of maybe what a commander would say to the group as they have to go out and go into one of these situations .
And a lot of the guys who work for me now are all guys who have done several tours , so I was able to get a lot of insight .
I tried to write what these guys would want to hear . ''
The song was released as the first single from Kid Rock 's ninth studio album , Rebel Soul , on October 1 , 2012 .
