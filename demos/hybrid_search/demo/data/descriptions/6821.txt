The lead single from singer-songwriter Bruno Mars ' sophomore album , Unorthodox Jukebox , features production by Mark Ronson , Jeff Bhasker , Emile Haynie and the songwriting/production team the Smeezingtons -LRB- Mars , Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine -RRB- .
The song finds Mars singing of a relationship that is so good the narrator feels like he was `` locked out of heaven '' before he met his lover .
It debuted digitally and on radio on October 1 , 2012 and became available for purchase the following day .
Though critics have been quick to point out the song 's similarities to some of the hits by the Police , Mars told MTV News he did not set out to write anything inspired by the Sting-fronted band .
Instead , it came to him out of the blue , one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album .
`` I do n't think it initially tried to sound like anybody else , but I picked up the guitar and just started playing -LSB- the song 's opening chords -RSB- , '' Mars explained .
`` That 's how it normally works ; I 'll pick up a guitar and I 'll start humming a melody , and I started singing that , and I was up there in Sting-ville , in that register , so that 's what you get ... I tend to listen to a lot of guys with higher registers - Sting being one of them , Freddie Mercury , Michael Jackson , Stevie Wonder - because I 've got a high voice . ''
Bruno Mars performed the song live for the first time when he hosted and did double duty as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live , October 20 , 2012 .
Co-producer Mark Ronson brought in the rhythm section of his frequent collaborators the Dap-Kings for this track .
-LRB- They are the soul band that Ronson used to back Amy Winehouse on her Back to Black album -RRB- `` It 's hard to create sounds with live instrumentation that bump in the club , and Mark Ronson did it here , '' Mars told Rolling Stone .
`` Since Back to Black , I 've always wanted to get into his head and see how he does it . ''
This set a new Spotify record in the week beginning December 16 , 2012 when it became the first song ever to be streamed more than one million times on the service over a 7 day period .
This won Best Song at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards .
Mars used this song to open his set at the 2014 Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos .
To start his halftime performance , Mars appeared behind a drum kit that moved toward the stage while he hit the skins .
When he left the kit , he moved to the front and sang with his band .
During his Google + Hangout on the day of the song 's release , Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track .
Mars picked the phrase `` But swimming in your water is something spiritual , '' and later said that the single 's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the `` sensual , sensual and sensual '' theme of the album .
The song 's stripped back music video was directed by Cameron Duddy , who also helmed the clip for Mars ' `` The Lazy Song . ''
The retro visual mainly features the singer performing the track in a club , with a few added VHS effects .
`` The concept is just old-fashioned fun .
No story line , it 's not me singing to a girl , you get a good sense of what you 're going to get live , '' explained Mars to MTV News .
`` It 's very VHS-y .
I love that man , it takes me back to my childhood , when the tracking is off and the color is off , there 's a beauty in that .
You 'd have to stand by the TV with , like , aluminum foil all over you . ''
The song finds Mars singing of a mystery woman -LRB- `` You bring me to my knees .
You make me testify .
You can make a sinner change his ways . '' -RRB-
Quizzed by UK radio station Capital FM whom Mars penned the song 's raunchy lyrics about , he replied .
`` I might as well just say it , Halle Berry .
`` Other references to the X Men actress in hit songs include Missy Elliott 's `` Work It '' -LRB- `` Do n't I look like a Halle Berry poster .
See the Belvedere playin ' tricks on you . '' -RRB-
and Kardinal Offishall 's `` Dangerous '' -LRB- `` I mean Megan Good and Halle Berry put together .
Ai n't close to the jubee I see '' -RRB- .
The song was the fifth heavenly-titled track to reach # 1 on the Hot 100 .
Can you guess what the other four chart-toppers to include the word ` heaven ' in their title were ?
They were :1979 `` Too Much Heaven , '' by the Bee Gees .1985 `` Heaven '' by Bryan Adams .1987 `` Heaven Is A Place On Earth '' by Belinda Carlisle .2005 `` Inside Your Heaven '' by Carrie Underwood .
Mars claimed his first # 1 album on the Billboard 200 when Unorthodox Jukebox jumped one slot to the top of the tally .
Its sales of 95,000 copies in the week ending March 3 , 2013 were largely fueled by sale pricing by Amazon MP3 .
This was nominated for Grammy Awards for Record Of The Year and Song Of The Year in 2013 , but did n't win either -LRB- `` Get Lucky '' by Daft Punk and `` Royals '' by Lorde took those trophies -RRB- .
Mars did n't go home empty handed ; he won Best Pop Vocal Album for Unorthodox Jukebox .
