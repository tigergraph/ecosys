Many of the lyrics in this song are about Dave Mustaine 's feelings toward Metallica , the band that fired him in 1983 .
He makes it clear in this song that he is still coping with these feelings , something that can be seen on the Metallica documentary Some Kind Of Monster , where Mustaine meets with Lars Ulrich in a therapy session and explains how hard it is for him to deal with the success of Metallica .
