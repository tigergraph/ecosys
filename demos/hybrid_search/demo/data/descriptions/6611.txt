The song chronicles a rundown couple in a rundown mining town , with him finding solace in the bottle and her seeking comfort in the ` Good Book ' - the Bible .
Tom Smith , vocalist with the English indie rock group The Editors , supplies a guest turn on the track .
Frontman Gary Lightbody , moonlighting from his day job as Snow Patrol 's singer , told Uncut magazine how the songs on The Place We Run From differ from regular Snow Patrol material : `` Every song I write for Snow Patrol is written out of a deep personal experience .
These songs are stories that people have told me or they 're about people I 've met along the way and it 's not necessarily through my eyes .
The whole time I spend touring the US was during the Bush administration , so a lot of this album is about crumbling America and the people it has affected and still affects . ''
