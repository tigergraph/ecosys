This drifting chamber piece about being transported over the threshold of life was written during the Spring of 2012 and was inspired by Tunstall 's adopted fathers ' struggle with illness .
Her dad , David Tunstall , was an eminent physicist and lecturer at St. Andrews University .
He died in August 2012 aged 73 .
The song deals with the question of where we go when we die .
`` I had become interested in the fact that when you die , very few of us will remain where we fall , '' Tunstall explained to Radio.com .
`` Who takes you there ?
And then a few months later I was literally doing the carrying .
I had my father 's ashes in a backpack and I was just thinking how bizarre that this song had become literal and I had never intended it to be so . ''
