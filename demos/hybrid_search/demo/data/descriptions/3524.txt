Texan-cum-Venezuelan singer-songwriter Devendra Banhart told Pitchfork Media about this song : `` All the records I 've made have been peppered with a couple little insouciant , joking tunes that are for fun .
Like I 'm trying to write weird bubble-gum pop .
But this record I tried to get all of that out with the one song , ` Chin Chin & Muck Muck ' , which I sing from the point of view of an old woman because that seems to be who I really am .
I go to bed at 8:30 , I drink warm milk , I watch my shows .
I like it . ''
