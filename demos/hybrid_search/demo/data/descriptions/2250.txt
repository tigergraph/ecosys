In an interview with the Associated Press , Flo Rida said this is his favorite track on R.O.O.T.S. .
He explained : `` I was obedient to my mom .
It definitely talks about the way I looked at life , growing up in the projects when my homeboys would do crazy things but I did n't .
I was my own leader .
It shows that you should have faith , never hold your head down , never fear man . ''
This features additional vocals from Keri Hilson .
