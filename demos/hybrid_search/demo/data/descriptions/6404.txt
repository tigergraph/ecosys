Red Hot Chili Peppers ' tenth studio album , I 'm With You , finds the band experimenting with some Afro-pop styles which were inspired by a trip that bassist Flea and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer took to Ethiopia .
This piece of social commentary about the planet incorporates Afrobeat rhythms and features the trumpet playing of Flea with Mike Bolger , who also played on Panic At The Disco 's Vices and Virtues album .
Flea told Spin magazine about the African trip : `` We 've always all loved African music .
Throughout our career we 've played some African bits , but we never really captured it right .
Josh and I tripped around Ethiopia with a group called Africa Express , which Damon Albarn -LSB- Blur , Gorillaz -RSB- organized .
We saw music every night and jammed with musicians .
Ethiopia is such a great country , beautiful place . ''
