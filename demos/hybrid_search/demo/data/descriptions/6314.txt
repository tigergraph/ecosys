The title of Dave Matthews Band 's eighth album comes from a line in this song : `` Sitting in a box .
Away from the world out there . ''
According to Matthews , it relates to the idea that we are born and die alone and that `` our body is our box . ''
Matthews told Rolling Stone in an interview around the time of the release of Away From This World that he finds songwriting gets more difficult , the older he gets .
`` I 'm still desperate to try and make something beautiful and not redo what I 've done in the past .
It 's good work , but it 's not easy for me , '' he said .
`` Nowadays , I have to dig a lot harder when I 'm writing .
I 'm more critical .
There 's a freedom to being young that is harder to come by as time goes on .
I try to justify what we do with our lives , and that question becomes more difficult to answer .
And I do n't have enough time to be as drug - and alcohol-soaked as I did 15 years ago . ''
