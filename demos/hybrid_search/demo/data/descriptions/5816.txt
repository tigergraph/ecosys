This song is about Mykel and Carli Allen , the women who ran the Weezer fan club .
They died in a car accident driving back from a Weezer concert .
They would always say `` hear you me . ''
The two women would often look for up and coming bands and would give them a place to stay .
The line , `` There 's no one in town I know , you gave us some place to go '' is talking about how when they would be in town for a concert and did n't know anyone , they stayed with Mykel and Carli , who gave them a place to stay .
