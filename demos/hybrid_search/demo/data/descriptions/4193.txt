This song is about Elvis Presley , specifically the decadence and swift decline of his later years .
The title refers to a figurine in Elvis ' TV room at Graceland .
Zevon saw his longtime songwriting partner Jorge Calderon 's postcard picture of the room and thought it would make a good starting point for the song .
Zevon took a dim view of what he considered Elvis ' overrated stature in American music , but decided the story of Elvis ' decline would fit in well with the theme of the Life 'll Kill Ya album .
