Keyboardist Tim Rice-Oxley wrote this jaunty track when he was driving up the West Coast of America .
He said on Keane 's website : `` I suspect it may have had its origins in some argument or other with my wife , but I ca n't remember !
But since that no doubt passed very quickly , I think the song has quite a jaunty feel to it , not too weighed down by its lyrical content !
I think it 's quite Beatles-y in that respect - sad words with a very ` happy ' melody .
I like the imagery of a relationship being like a decrepit house , especially the line about boarding up the windows . ''
The song 's music video was filmed in a haunted house in Barcelona , Spain and was inspired by the aesthetic of 1970s horror films .
The clip was co-directed by Spanish directors JA Bayona and Sergio G. Sanchez. , who joined forces for the first time in the cult horror movie The Orphanage - Bayona as director and Sanchez as screenwriter .
Having initially filed it away , Rice-Oxley only finished the song after stumbling across the rough sketch in the studio and giving it a quick listen , just as bassist Jesse Quin came in and said , `` What 's that ?
I love it ! ''
This won Best Video at the 2012 Q Awards .
Vocalist Tom Chaplin modestly gave credit to the directors .
He told the magazine : `` We just gave them the song and they dreamt up this unbelievable idea . ''
