Matt Tuck in Metal Hammer magazine : `` It is a lot fresher than everything on The Poison - a lot more of tempo .
It 's got one of the most beautiful middle-sections we 've ever created on a song .
Very epic , very guitar hero arena-esque .
Lyrically and vocally it is a collaboration with our friend Benji from Skindred .
Lyrically it is about taking up frustration in a positive way .
We never had anyone else singing on a Bullet For My Valentine track . ''
