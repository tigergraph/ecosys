George 's son , Bubba Strait , was the sole writer of this Western-styled song .
Tony Brown , Strait 's producer since his 1981 debut disc Strait Country , said in publicity materials : `` That one sounds like a Johnny Cash song to me .
I had George 's harmony singer , Marty Slayton , listen to how June Carter would harmonize with Cash to get more of that flavor .
She nailed it , and it helps make the song sound unlike anything George has ever cut . ''
