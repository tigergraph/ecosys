The Weight of Your Love found singer and principal songwriter Tom Smith writing directly about love in a manner he never has before .
The Editors ' frontman told The Sun : `` Whether it 's about a break-up , or is twisted and dark , about the damaging side of love , or is simply about traditional love , this is certainly the theme of the album -- and in two of the song titles .
A song like ` Sugar ' is about love but also has that jealousy issue going through it .
`` I do let my imagination get carried away when I write , '' he continued .
`` I do n't agree you have to be sad to write a sad song and vice versa .
Writers have imaginations .
The whole tortured artist thing is bulls -- t. ''
