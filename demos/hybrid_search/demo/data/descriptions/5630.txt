In our interview , Waterhouse revealed that `` Is That Clear '' was a song that he originally started writing in high school at age 15 .
Waterhouse was 25 when the song was released , giving it a 10 year concept-to-completion cycle .
`` Is That Clear '' falls in line with most Waterhouse releases - retro R&B sounds wrapped around a strong , personal experience or sentiment .
In this case , the exact nature of what he 's expressing is left a bit ambiguous : the lyrics , apparently speaking somebody Waterhouse is in love with , announce that `` he wo n't . ''
`` I want it clear , '' he concludes .
`` Is that clear ? ''
It 's left uncertain whether Waterhouse wo n't put up with her any more , or whether he means he wo n't stop loving her .
Waterhouse went on to explain that `` it 's a really simple song , but it 's so simple you take it for granted .
The kind of thing that you feel like has been done a million times , but you look around you realize , oh , nobody else did that . ''

The song appears on Waterhouse 's debut album , Time 's All Gone .
While recording the record , Waterhouse was swindled by a scam artist from New York city who offered to fund its production .
When the money did n't come through , Waterhouse , rather than giving up , drew from his own funds to complete recording - often at the expense of food or rent money .
