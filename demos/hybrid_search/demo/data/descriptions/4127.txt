Frontman and songwriter John Branwell wrote this about his younger self .
Speaking with 7Digital , he said how `` contrast is key '' on Let It All In .
He explained : `` On the record : one emotional thought can contradict another one and I like to put those things together .
` Mouth On Me ' is about feeling like I did n't fit in when I was young , and ` Masquerade ' is about saying that I still do n't fit in , but so what ?
-LRB- Laughs -RRB- So it 's two sides of the same coin , those songs , but one 's a bit more confident than the other . ''
