Ke $ ha wrote this song about a guy she 's been `` stalking '' since the age of 15 .
She told MTV News : `` I 'm really excited for people to hear the song called ` Stephen ' that I wrote about this guy that I 've been stalking since I was , like , 15 , but he 's a total loser , so I do n't want to glorify him in any way .
`` Ke $ ha added that in the end , it all worked out for her .
`` He would n't call me , and I could not wrap my brain around why he would n't call me , '' she said .
`` That was a victorious mission in the end .
Ha !
I have the last laugh . ''
Ke $ ha told Digital Spy that this is one of her favorite tracks from Animal as it `` shows the vulnerable side of me but it 's still a funny pop song .
It 's me saying I 'm totally obsessive and in love with this guy , but he 's blowing me off in a pretty funny way . ''
