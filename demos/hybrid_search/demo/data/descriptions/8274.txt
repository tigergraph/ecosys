Lambert commented on the creation of this furious song in which a radio gets filled with bullets : `` I had that title for a long time in my head , and I could n't figure out what I was going to do with it .
It started out a little more mellow .
But the more intense the lyrics got , the more I thought , okay , this needs to be a rocker .
I wrote it at my farm in Oklahoma .
I went over to Blake -LRB- Shelton -RRB- 's and asked him to play on the demo , just on my Garage Band with me .
And he added that guitar lick , which is so signature to the song now .
I told him he still does n't get a co-write !
But he added that cool sound to it , and he 's the one screaming in the background . ''
