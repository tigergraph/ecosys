This is the third single from Los Angeles born R&B singer-songwriter Miguel 's debut album , All I Want Is You .
The single was released on June 13 , 2011 .
Miguel shot a dual video for this and `` Girls Like You '' in July 2011 .
The visual for this song was co-directed by Miguel with Alex Moors , who previously helmed Kanye West 's `` Runaway '' clip .
It mixes the classic black and white film with the sensuality of the song .
Miguel stated to Rap-Up .
com : `` I was very hands-on in the execution and the creative elements -- from casting to the treatment to choosing the director and cinematography , the entire theme of the two videos - it 's kind of my brainchild . ''
Back in 2007 , Miguel provided guest vocals on three tracks on American rapper Blu 's collaborative album with hip hop producer Exile , Below The Heavens .
This song was written by Miguel during a night out at Detroit Bar watching the duo perform .
He recalled to LA Weekly .
`` I 'll never forget watching Blu and Exile 's set that night , and meeting a whole string of friends and being introduced to a scene that to this day has been a part of my life .
And ` Quickie ' is one of the songs that got me signed . ''
