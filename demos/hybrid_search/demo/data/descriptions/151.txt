This song is a description of the way you need to survive in capitalistic society .
It deals with Manson 's personal struggle of being a wormboy -LRB- or middle class loser -RRB- to being a famous Rock Star .
He 's making a link between the American Media and Nazi propaganda , as well as the need to to be physically perfect because of the hyper-reality we are brainwashed by .
It 's also about the Rock Star looking down on the worms that make him what he is - this need to be more then a worm is what made him a star .
The average rebel can relate to the song because Manson is making ugly fashionable , which is easier to achieve than the perfection we see on other CD covers and on MTV .
-LRB- thanks , Mac TheKnife - Cape Town , South Africa -RRB- Radio stations usually play an edited version that says `` every other hater '' rather than `` every motherf *** er . ''
-LRB- thanks , Nick - Paramus , NJ -RRB- The `` Antichrist Superstar '' is a character Manson took on to make people question their belief in God .
It is a play on `` Jesus Christ , Superstar , '' which was the name of a Broadway play .
