This upbeat tune is the first studio release from American recording artist Chris Brown 's third studio album , Graffiti .
The song was previously known as `` Transformer . ''
This was the first sanctioned record Brown released after his altercation with former girlfriend Rihanna , which resulted in his guilty plea to an assault charge .
Swiss Beatz , who produced the track , told MTV News : `` He 's got something to prove .
He worked on 60 , 70 songs .
He 's just on fire .
I told him , ` Listen , man , just stay focused on your music .
They gon na throw shots at you .
Time heals everything . '
He has great support ; his mother is amazing .
I was really scoping out the situation , it could have been something I did n't want to be around , but I really got a great vibe .
Honestly . ''
Lil Wayne also appears in the song 's music video along with producer Swizz Beatz .
The Joseph Kahn-directed clip , in which Brown morphs into various things such as a fire truck or an expensive sports car is a play on the movie Transformers .
Kahn 's resume includes clips for Britney Spears -LRB- `` Womanizer '' -RRB- , Eminem -LRB- `` We Made You '' -RRB- and Lady Gaga -LRB- `` Lovegame '' -RRB- .
He had worked with Brown previously on his video for `` Forever , '' and the singer 's collaboration with Ester Dean `` Drop It Low . ''
The director told MTV News : `` I met with Chris when we were doing the ` Drop It Low ' video , and he played me a couple tracks off his new album , and he already had a pretty clear idea of what he wanted out of ` Transform Ya , ' And , obviously , him going in there and dancing and turning into cars and trucks is right up my alley . ''
He added : `` His interests , in terms of kung fu and special effects and science fiction and all the boy-culture stuff , it falls directly in line with what I like .
So , we 're kind of a great match . ''
In this song , Brown sings about providing for his lady anything she desires .
The track features rapper Lil Wayne .
Swizz told MTV News that Weezy was at his best on this track .
He said : `` The Wayne part is just nothing to talk about .
He really showed his ass on this one .
It 's probably the best feature verse since the ` It 's Me -LSB- Bi -- es -RSB- ' remix .
He really went in on the ` Transformer ' joint . ''
