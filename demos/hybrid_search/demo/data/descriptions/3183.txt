A play on the phrase `` Vice Versa , '' which means `` the other way around , '' this is the title track to Switchfoot 's second album released on their own lowercase people label .
Their frontman Jon Foreman told us that their successful debut album on the label , which was called Hello Hurricane , gave them , `` A new sense of boldness and strength that comes from operating from a place where we 're not afraid to say exactly what we mean and mean exactly what we say , and maybe in a way that we 've never felt as a band before . ''
This song is a look at natural wonder and our place in the world .
Regarding the lyrics , `` Where is God in the earthquake ?
, '' Foreman told us that he wrote the song long before the March 11 , 2011 earthquake in Japan .
Said the songwriter : `` When we were finishing up Hello Hurricane was when I wrote that song .
The first line of the songs is , ` Walking along the high tide line , ' and that 's where the song began .
The high tide line - in the morning , you can tell where the ocean leaves its mark from the night before , and it washes up all the debris from the night before .
So that 's where that song begins , is kind of looking through the things that people did n't want , the trash from boats and beachgoers that they left behind for the Pacific to have its way with .
And for me , I felt that it was a good place to start a song that 's looking for meaning .
So there was n't one specific earthquake or one specific disaster in my life that inspired that song , but it was written out of a definite moment of frailty where you 're looking for purpose and hoping to find it . ''
