This song was inspired by Johnny Marr 's experience of going to Northern Soul all-nighters in and around his home city of Manchester .
He told Mojo magazine : `` Almost all soul records are built around brass and piano .
I bunch the brass and piano parts together and hear them as guitar riffs .
That 's how I first learned to play records on the guitar .
-LRB- The Smiths ' -RRB- ` Girl Afraid ' : that was me thinking I was playing a Little Richard song on guitar . ''
Regarding the song 's meaning , Marr told NME : `` It 's about how it 's easy to be unaware that we 're seen as targets by corporations .
When you 're young , you can see through that , and it can become a feeling of empowerment .
Alternative culture can be a weapon . ''
The song is a track from the former Smiths , Modest Mouse and Cribs ' guitarist 's first solo album , The Messenger .
Having returned to England after a stint living in Portland , Marr recorded the LP in Manchester and London , with the songs mastered at Abbey Road studios to enhance its Englishness .
`` The underlying idea of the record is my experience of living in Britain , '' he explained .
`` When you 're away from your home city you 're more compelled to write about it .
Growing up in the city influences you , and as I 've grown older I 've continued to see beauty , energy and stories in it . ''
