Faulkner penned this song with Japanese producer Keigo Oyamada , who records under the name of Cornelius .
The English singer-songwriter explained : `` I wrote it in a hotel room in Tokyo .
I was there to work with Cornelius , who I 've loved forever .
We had a writing session together , which he does n't normally do . ''
