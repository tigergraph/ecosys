This is the lead single by American rapper Azealia Banks , from her mixtape Fantasea .
`` Real bitch all day , uptown Broadway , '' she spits in tribute to her New York roots .
The single was released online on May 11 , 2012 .
The song shares its title with a 1981 children 's book written and illustrated by the American author Chris Van Allsburg , which was made into a 1995 fantasy film starring Robin Williams .
The book is about a supernatural board game that makes jungle animals materialize upon each player 's move .
The song 's tropical sound reflects the novel 's jungle setting but its lyrical references to `` reefer and cabanas '' and `` bougie bitches '' certainly do not!This is n't the first time `` Jumanji '' was used in another context : Craig Kilborn said it as a catchphrase on SportsCenter when he hosted the ESPN show in the '90s .
Hudson Mohawke and Nick Hook 's production commences with a harp before featuring some steel drums .
Hudson Mohawke -LRB- real name Ross Birchard -RRB- is an electronic music producer/DJ from Glasgow , Scotland .
He is a purveyor of the hip-hop/electronic offshoot that is sometimes known as aqua-crunk or wonky .
Nick Hook began his DJ/producer career back in the early days of the UK house music revolution and has produced well over 100 tracks for many of the best house music labels .
According to Robin Williams , `` Jumanji '' is a Zulu word meaning `` many effects , '' referring to the computer-generated animals in the film , which were pretty impressive in the pre-Pixar era .
