This is about the European slaughter of Native Americans , as the colonization of North America caused the near-extinction of the Native American populace .
Matthews said of the song : `` There 's times when I 've traveled around this fine country , and others , but this fine country , I remember one time standing at the edge of lake Superior , up there , we were camping up on the northern side of it and looking out and imagining these little rocks that jut out , families of people going past in canoes and hunting on the side of the lake there , and also like if you sit and look at the Grand Canyon and get a little distance between you and that McDonald 's that 's peering down over the canyon with you , and just imagine the quiet that must have been there and the people that enjoyed it before we came , and I just get awed because it 's sort of an overwhelming feeling looking at those things just going , `` man does that suck , does it suck . ''
That you could erase somebody , ya know ?
take somebody 's whole universe away .
It 's just unbelievable for those people ... just the fact that a little bit of our history has a lot of poison in it and that maybe we ca n't reverse things but maybe pay a little tribute to it every once and a while . ''
