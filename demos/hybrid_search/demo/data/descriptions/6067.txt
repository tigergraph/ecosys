This song is about how human life is so easily `` wasted . ''
Examples in the song : A baby dies shortly after birth .
A 16-year-old boy , going to fast , takes a wrong turn and kills everyone in the car .
A 32-year-old man develops cancer .
This song is also about how you should slow down and appreciate your surroundings because , eventually , everyone 's life will be `` wasted . ''
