Guitarist Mark Prendergast wrote this nostalgic tune over lunch with a childhood friend .
`` The song 's about growing up together , looking back at our childhoods and the freedom we did n't know we had , '' he explained to Radio.com .
`` You get a little older and you know so much more .
It 's best to remember those days in a positive happy way . ''
Vocalist Stephen Garrigan discussed the song with Artist Direct .
`` It 's about growing up , '' he said .
`` A friend of ours passed away .
You 're looking back and celebrating your friends .
Tough things happen , and they 're going to happen .
You 're only going to live once so it 's best to smile .
All of the members in the band grew up in the same town , and we were friends before we played music . ''
