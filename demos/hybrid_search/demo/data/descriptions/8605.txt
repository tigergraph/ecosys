According to Iggy Pop , this song 's riff came out of a jam session when the whole band was stoned and Iggy made up lyrics to go with it based on `` I Walk The Line '' by Johnny Cash .
-LRB- thanks , Matt - Auckland , New Zealand -RRB- This is a track from the American rock band 's self-titled first album , which is today acknowledged as one of the greatest debut long players ever .
The band only had five tracks to include on their first release as a typical Stooges song of the period would involve two minutes of composed song followed by several minutes of improvisation .
The Stooges were told by Elektra that they needed more material so the other three songs - `` Real Cool Time , '' `` Not Right '' and `` Little Doll '' were written overnight and recorded the next day .
