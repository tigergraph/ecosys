The first single from alternative rock band O.A.R. 's seventh studio album , King finds frontman Marc Roberge railing against those who pass judgment on people on the basis of religion .
Roberge penned this rocking reggae effort after taking a break to be with his wife who was recovering from cancer .
The song was released on June 7 , 2011 on Wind-Up Records .
The song was the last track recorded for the album and came from a beat - jokingly titled `` New O.A.R. '' - that Roberge 's brother-in-law played for him in October 2010 .
`` Flash forward six months , '' Roberge told Billboard magazine , `` and the album is pretty much done and I said , ` Let 's do one more . '
We were flipping through demos , and I had a demo of this beat and what I had tried singing over it just for fun , and everyone said , ` Man , this is something . '
So we bounced ideas back and forth , and we just knew something that we felt told the entire story of this character and this album .
It began in the driveway , and it ended with O.A.R. in the studio cutting it , just 'cause it felt right .
It 's funny how things like that always fall into your lap at the last minute . ''
