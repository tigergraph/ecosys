2010 American Idol runner up Crystal Bowersox co-wrote this soulful country duet with her husband Brian Walker , and they performed the tune together at their October 10 , 2010 nuptials , at Uncommon Ground Caf√© in Chicago .
Walker actually began the song in 2008 , before Bowersox penned its bridge .
Crystal told Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo Music .
`` Back before Idol , we were both open-mic musicians .
We 'd frequent the same place , and one week I 'd go in with a new song that I 'd written about him , and no one else in the room knew - but he knew !
And then he 'd get onstage and sing a song that he wrote for me .
It was just love letter back and forth , for years .
` Mason ' was one of those songs . ' ''
