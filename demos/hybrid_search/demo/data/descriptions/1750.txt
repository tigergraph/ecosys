This is the first single from Scurrilous , the third studio album by Canadian progressive metal band Protest the Hero .
The album cover is a 60-year-old painting by bassist Arif Mirabdolbaghi 's grandfather , Jafar Petgar , titled Scurrilous .
The painting was inspired by an argument between Petgar and his wife that stemmed from `` conjecture and scurrilous lies '' being spread by a neighbor .
The picture is meant to represent the world fleeing from the lies originating from the human tongue .
Mirabdolbaghi told Noisecreep the piece was selected as the cover art because they , `` thought the wide and varied use of color in the piece reflected the contrasting sonic landscapes of the music on the album . ''
`` C'est la vie , '' is a French phrase meaning , `` Such is life . ''
Frontman Rody Walker explained the song to Alternative Press : `` Arif -LSB- Mirabdolbagh -RSB- wrote this song , so this will be merely my interpretation of the lyrics .
It 's about the insignificance of suicide and the fleeting few moments where anyone might give a f -- k. Inside that , it explores appreciating the little things in life that make it worth living . ''
