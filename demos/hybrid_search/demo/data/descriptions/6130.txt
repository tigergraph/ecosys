This acoustic-tinged ballad has an unusual twist as when the girl leaves her man , instead of moping , the man feels great .
It 's a huge contrast from the '70s hit `` Without You , '' where the singer has a hard time adjusting to his heart being ripped out.Hinder 's `` Without You '' was written by band members Cody Hanson -LRB- drums -RRB- and Austin Winkler -LRB- vocals -RRB- along with their producer Brian Howes .
Hanson told us that most of their songs that click are the ones inspired by real life events , as was the case with their big hit `` Lips Of An Angel . ''
Said Hanson : `` Those songs that are real personal experiences that other people can relate to , those seem to be the ones that go . ''
The video has some star power : the couple are portrayed by Kellan Lutz of Twilight and Aimee Teegarden of Friday Night Lights .
In the clip , it is the girl who is expressing the thoughts of the song , as Teegarden plays the wholesome , intelligent girl who is caught up with a troublesome boyfriend .
When she leaves him behind , she graduates and looks forward to a bright future .
