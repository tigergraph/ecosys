Peace vocalist Harrison Koisser told NME : `` It just happened over the space of 15 minutes .
The lyrics sort of popped into my head so we recorded them .
Sometimes it 's good to keep stuff straightforward . ''
Harrison Koisser said of this teenage paean to diving headfirst into your first crush : '' ` Lovesick ' is a really uncool song .
Saying that , sometimes it 's not about anything except what you FEEL .
And when you reach that place , things happen that are beautiful .
Beautiful because they 're really really real . ''
At 152 beats per minute , this is the fastest song on the In Love album .
The song 's music video was directed by Jesse Jenkins , and is a sequel to the band 's previous clip for `` Wraith . ''
