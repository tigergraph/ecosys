Plumb originally penned this song with her longtime producer Matt Bronleewe as a song competition entry for a commercial campaign .
She explained to Billboard magazine : `` They wanted something hopeful , something summer-y .
We came up with a theme of , ` by ourselves we 're good , but together we really make a great team . ' ''
Plumb added : `` By the way , that campaign went away before they picked a winner ... so , just for the record , we did n't lose ... And , we have a great song . ''
