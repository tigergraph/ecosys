This was the first track released from Deftones 's seventh studio album , Koi No Yokan .
The record was recorded in Los Angeles with Nick Raskulinecz -LRB- Alice In Chains , Foo Fighters , Rush -RRB- who also produced the band 's previous set , Diamond Eyes .
`` We 'd taken so much time between records , had some inner turmoil and our records were starting to get pieced together versus really being created together , so for us it was a chance to get back to basics , '' vocalist Chino Moreno told Noisecreep .
`` We did n't have an idea of what sort of style we wanted .
We just came in fired up and motivated to do something great .
It was all very positive .
We had more songs than ever , tons of ideas . ''
The album title , Koi No Yokan , is a Japanese phrase meaning a love at first sight that is one 's destiny , even though the object of the affections remains unknown .
The song was offered as a limited-time free download exclusively via deftones.com .
