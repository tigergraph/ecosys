Mt. Desolation are an Alternative Country band formed by Keane 's Tim Rice-Oxley and the band 's live bassist Jesse Quin .
Also featuring in the line-up are Noah & The Whale 's fiddle player Tom Hobden , Brigade drummer Fimbo , singer-songwriters Andrew Lowe , Pete Roe and Jessica Staveley-Taylor , plus Long Winters frontman John Roderick .
This was the first single from the project , released in North America only .
Rice-Oxley picks up the mic as the lead vocalist on this track .
His only previous credit as the main singer was on Keane 's `` Your Love . ''
He told Spin Magazine : `` For me and Jesse , that was the biggest challenge of all , to do the singing rather than hiding behind -LSB- Keane singer -RSB- Tom -LSB- Chaplin -RSB- . ''
This was one of the first songs written for the Mt. Desolation project .
`` The song traces a story back through time to a young love affair , and someone going off to find better , more exciting things while dropping someone really harshly , '' Rice-Oxley explained to Spin Magazine , `` only to realize that what they wanted all along was there at home in their little town , with the person they started out with . ''
