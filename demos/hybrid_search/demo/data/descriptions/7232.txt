This mid-tempo rocker was produced and co-written by Dr. Dre/Eminem associate Mike Elizondo -LRB- Maroon 5 , Blake Lewis -RRB- .
Allen and Switchfoot singer Jon Foreman also contributed to the track .
Allen recalled to Billboard magazine that before he teamed up with Elizondo , he did not know who he was .
He recalled : `` I 'm still new in the music business - it was funny , they would be like , ` You 're going to write and produce with this guy , ' and I 'd be like , ` OK ! '
I did n't know who it was , so I would look them up on Wikipedia .
When I went to work with Mike Elizondo , I had no idea who he was .
I went on the Internet and it was like - Dr. Dre , Eminem , Switchfoot , Maroon 5 , Fiona Apple and a bunch of people , and I was like , ` What 's he doing with me ? '
-LSB- laughs -RSB- I ended up going to his house many , many times and working on a lot of songs with him . ''
