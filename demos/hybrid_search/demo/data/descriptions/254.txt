The British rapper then teamed up with producer Lab 18 Labyrinth to create his debut album ADHD .
This song was the second single from the album .
Kerlin explained to MTV UK that the album title , `` stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - because my music is just so crazy and it 's so all over the place and it craves attention . ''
This song is about the temptation to two time the narrator 's girlfriend who cooks much better and looks much better than the girl he wants to pull .
