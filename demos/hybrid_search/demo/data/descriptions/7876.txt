This is the title track from American singer-songwriter Laura Veirs ' seventh studio album .
The inspiration for the song came from a type of peach Veirs saw on a summer visit to the farmer 's market .
She explained to The Portland Mercury : `` I just saw it at the market and I was like , ` Oh , that 's a cool name for a peach , I 'll write a song about that . ' ''
Veirs explained how this song ended her writer 's block and ignited the album : `` I 'd been in a songwriting slump at that time and writing that song pushed me over my plateau and into a new place where I was surprising myself again .
I invented oddball tunings so I was really using my ear to search out new-sounding melodies and patterns .
I wrote this album from a searching , soulful place .
I hope it elicits a real gut feeling . ''
