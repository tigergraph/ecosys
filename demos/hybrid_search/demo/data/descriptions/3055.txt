This was the debut single from Strait 's 2009 album Twang and the eighty-eighth single release of his career .
Bubba Strait has four songwriting credits on Twang whilst George Strait has three .
Strait senior explained in a video promoting the album 's release that Bubba was the inspiration for him to write some original songs for Twang .
Said Strait : `` My son started toying with the idea of trying to write a little bit , so that kind of gave me the bug to write , also .
So we started writing a few things together , and I kind of got into it again .
I had the idea for ` Living for the Night ' for a long , long time , but I just never got around to sitting down and trying to write it . ''
Strait wrote this with his son , Bubba , and his frequent songwriter Dean Dillon .
It was his first single on which the country legend had a co-writing credit .
Dean Dillon told AOL 's The Boot about how this song was written : `` I went down to George 's ranch in south Texas .
We sat down to write some stuff when I got there .
They had been `` practicing '' so-to-speak for the last six months or year .
I do n't think they were quite so sure that they what they had.They played me a couple things before we even started writing - a couple of things they had been dabbling with .
Bubba comes at it from a little different angle , which is great .
You always want that other perspective .
We just dove into it head first and spent about two to three hours writing it .
George and Bubba hold their own wind , buddy , as far as writing goes !
We had a good time , and it turned out great . ''
