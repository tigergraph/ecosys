Carlile wrote this song about a high school friend who committed suicide when they were both 16 .
At the time she was angry and confused over her friend 's choice , but she has finally come to a place of forgiveness and is at peace about it.In our interview with Brandi Carlile , she explained : `` I was just in such a hyperactive phase in my life .
But one of the ways that I moved past it was by blocking it out in terms like applying this sort of ridiculous rigid concept to it about selfishness .
I just wrote it off and never talked about it or thought about it .
And then like 10 years later this song came out of nowhere .
You know , your feelings , it 's just funny how they surface like that .
And I wrote this song about reconciliation and forgiveness , and the understanding for the first time that he 's what happened to him , not anybody else . ''
This track , along with the rest of Give Up the Ghost , was helmed by Grammy award winning producer Rick Rubin .
