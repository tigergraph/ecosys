This song was designed to `` add some flavor '' to the Significant Other CD .
Rapper Method Man is a guest vocalist on the track .
On each of their albums , the band would bring in at least one popular rapper to provide a Hip-Hop influence .
`` We like to have a variety of music on Limp Bizkit records that swings back and forth between being more traditional Hip-Hop and then more traditional Rock or Metal , '' guitarist Wes Borland told us .
`` Like a bunch of songs that tie those two elements together so that people are n't getting just a perfectly balanced meal with every song . ''
When Limp Bizkit played this song live , they would often pick out someone from the audience to sing the Method Man parts .
The interlude that leads into the track is a song called `` My Billygoat , '' and is sung by Fred 's mother .
You ca n't hear it just by going to the track and pressing play , the only way to hear it is to listen to the previous track .
