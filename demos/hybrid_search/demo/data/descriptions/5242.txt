An overall theme that runs through The Cars seventh album , Move Like This , is that of lead vocalist and songwriter Ric Ocasek coming to terms with his lot in life and looking into the future .
He explained to Spinner UK : `` It was a lot of ` What 's going on in the world today ? '
Maybe even a little sarcastic , weird look at it .
It was just what I was feeling these days , this year .
Just a bit about the times . ''
The song was originally previewed by the band as a 73-second sample on their Facebook page in October 2010 .
A full video was released February 17 , 2011 .
This song reflects the theme .
Said Ocasek to Spinner : `` The world 's full of quackers .
There 's a lot of quackers out there .
` Stroking all the gunheads , ' ` Stupefying the thinkers . '
It 's like a big ball of junk mail . ''
