This song is about the first time you learn to `` Self Satisfy . ''
At some concerts , toward the end of the song Maynard Keenan will `` jerk '' his water bottle around until the climax of the song when he sprays water everywhere .
Keenan had a similar song while in Tool : `` Part Of Me , '' on Opiate .
