Lead singer Dax Riggs : `` It 's kind of weird .
We went to Florida and we met these beach bums out on the beach .
I think it was cocoa beach .
Anyway , they were like ` yeah man , we 've got these psychedelics .
You want some ? '
And we were like , sure .
I grabbed the bottle - it was an antifreeze container full of this stuff - and I just guzzled it .
I thought it was mushrooms and it turned out to be angel trumpets , which some people in Florida died from taking .
We all did it and within a couple minutes of taking it , I passed out on the beach .
I was just laying there .
I woke up and it was so weird .
It f -- ked us up for days .
That 's really what ` Dying felt so goddamn good today ' is all about .
I 'm not a Christian and I 'd like to get more of that across because I think the Pagan beliefs are more peaceful .
You give thanks to everything , the sun , the moon , everything . ''
