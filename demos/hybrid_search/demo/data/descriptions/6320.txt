This is a melancholy ballad , sung in almost whispers .
It tells the story of a man who thinks about the trouble in his past : `` I 've dealt with my ghosts and I 've faced all my demons - Finally content with the past I regret . ''
He states that he 's finally found peace with himself , now that he has moved away from the town that he lives : `` I never dreamed home would end up where I do n't belong - I 'm movin ' on . ''
