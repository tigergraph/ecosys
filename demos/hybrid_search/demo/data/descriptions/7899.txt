This optimistic Electro-Pop love anthem is a songwriting collaboration between Ellie `` Starry Eyed '' Goulding , Guy Sigsworth and Vickers herself .
Sigsworth , who has also worked with Seal , Bj√∂rk and Madonna , was a major influence on the album .
Vickers explained to Spinner UK : `` I worked with some different producers and liked some things we were doing , and worked with others that I did n't like the sound of so much .
I worked with Guy Sigsworth , who is this incredible producer and he was the one that made me realise my voice goes quite well with synths and electro music .
He was definitely a massive part in my album . ''
