`` Why Does It Hurt When I Pee ? ''
is the seventh track on Joe 's Garage , Frank Zappa 's triple concept album set in an America where music has been made totally illegal .
It was typical of both Zappa 's twisted sense of humour and his disdain for musical or any convention that he would give a song with this sort of toilet humour title and subject matter the grandiose treatment .
The reason it hurts is because Joe has contracted an unmentionable disease from Lucille -LRB- who features in the next song -RRB- not for the reason he thinks , or gives , here .
The vocals are supplied by Ike Willis , a long term member of Zappa 's entourage who shared his sense of humour .
`` Why Does It Hurt When I Pee ? ''
runs to 2 minutes 36 seconds .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 2 -RRB-
