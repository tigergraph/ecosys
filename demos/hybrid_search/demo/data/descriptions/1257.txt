There are n't many songs about changing shape until life peters out , but you can count this quietly menacing fantasy in as one of them .
Lead singer Jonathan Higgs told Spinner that the imagery `` came from somebody I knew who could n't really move .
`` He added : `` I 'm not a particularly energetic person , and it made me think a lot about the fact that I spend all my time sitting around moaning that I 'm too fat when I could easily get up and do something .
And some people ca n't .
It 's kind of , ` Pull yourself together , use your body . ' ''
