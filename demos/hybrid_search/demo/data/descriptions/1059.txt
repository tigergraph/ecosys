Over the two years following the release of his Battle Studies album , John Mayer experienced a number of difficulties , including a backlash following a controversial Playboy interview and throat surgery for a granuloma near his vocal chord .
`` My shadow days are over , '' he sings in this country-tinged song reflecting the hope that his bad times are over .
American pianist and keyboardist Chuck Leavell , formerly of the Allman Brothers Band , plays on this track .
He also worked with The Rolling Stones throughout the '80s .
The song was co-produced by Don Was , who as one half of Was -LRB- Not Was -RRB- found commercial success in the 1980s .
Since then he has received multiple Grammy Awards for his production work including Producer of the Year in 1995 .
Mayer broke up with Jennifer Aniston in March 2009 , after dating her for ten months .
He continued to retain strong feelings for the actress , and its been suggested that the singer penned this as a `` goodbye letter '' to his former girlfriend .
A source told US Weekly : '' ` Shadow Days ' is about Jen .
It really took him a long time to get over her .
He really loved her a lot .
He wrote the song as a farewell letter knowing -LSB- Jen -RSB- would hear it .
Ultimately he 's done a lot of self reflection though and he realizes they were n't right for each other . ''
