This was the first song that drummer Matt Greiner put his sticks to on Rescue & Restore .
He told Antiquiet : `` I probably spent three days on the first ten seconds of the song .
With any record I write , it 's typically the case that the first song takes exponentially longer to complete than the rest of the album .
That was definitely the case with this song . ''
`` One interesting note about the process of recording drums for this song , '' he added , `` is the fact that I broke a stick while tracking and just kept on playing through the end .
The funniest thing about it is that we actually kept the take and you ca n't even hear the broken stick in the mix .
Strange ! ''
Greiner told Antiquiet that his favorite part about the song , `` is the chaotic section near the beginning where the snare drum hits accent the dissonant note that JB and Brent play . ''
The drummer added that he loves , `` how the riff keeps going in the same direction and the drums compliment it in a number of different ways . ''
The drumbeat over the song 's second riff was inspired by the soundtrack for Slumdog Millionaire .
Greiner explained to AntiQuiet : `` I was watching that movie one night and heard a beat in the background of a horrific torture scene where the bad guy is manipulating the children he 's enslaved into begging for money .
I loved how the drums sounded and went straight to the practice space and wrote a similar rendition of the beat I had just heard . ''
The drum roll at the end of the song was inspired by Greiner 's ABR videographer friend , Brandon , who nagged at him for a couple of years , `` about doing a repeating single stroke roll around the drum-kit . ''
