Fazer Online Music Magazine asked keyboardist and singer Andrew McMahon which song he considered to be the coolest on The Glass Passenger .
The Jack 's Mannequin mainman replied that he thought this was `` inherently maybe the coolest song . ''
He continued : `` There 's songs that I think are maybe bigger accomplishments and might even be more musically evolved but that song is like , just from it 's writing to it 's recording , everything about it was very natural .
You have these songs that you struggle with and you spend months figuring out how to work it out and make it happen .
That was a song that was just like from the second I wrote the first words till it was done , to the second we were in the studio - there was no resistance anywhere .
We just charged right down the path and when it was done we were all just like ` yeah it sounds so good . '
So I have to say that one is pretty cool , it 's a pretty simple song .
`` McMahon concluded that `` Annie '' was , `` really an evolved piece of music , it 's probably one of the lushest , coolest sounding arrangements , the chorus has this really cool , all fourths , so really like a bizarre eastern or Asian-sounding theme .
You know but it came so naturally that I ca n't help but love it . ''
