Josh Todd is the lead singer of Buckcherry .
In an interview with Star Polish , he said : `` I kept playing these chords over and over again on my guitar at home .
I was just singing this melody , -LSB- which became -RSB- the chorus of ` Lovely Bones . '
Finally , there was just a lot of loss going on around me , human loss , at the time .
There was this book lying around the house - actually it was a book that my wife , I 'm married , by the way - had gotten to read and she just would never read it .
I was like , ` Are you ever going to read this ? '
and she told me what the book was about .
I thought it was something that I 'd like to read , so I started reading it .
It was just this series of events that inspired me to write the song .
Starting from that guitar chord , this is what came out . ''
