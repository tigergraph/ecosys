American Rapper Jermaine Cole , better known by his stage name J.Cole , was the first artist signed to Jay-Z 's Roc Nation label .
Cole first came to the public 's attention when he dropped a guest verse on Hova 's aptly titled `` A Star is Born . ''
The music video was filmed in the final week of May 2010 at Fayetteville , North Carolina , which is J. Cole 's hometown .
The clip comprises one epic single tracking shot , with cheerleaders , a marching band and explosions , but no cuts .
The song did n't make the final cut of Cole World because it was released over a year prior to the album with only moderate showing on the charts .
This is the first single from his debut album , Cole World .
Cole explained to Vibe magazine that he chose this to be his first single `` because it 's really about the beat and the raps and not much more .
It 's an introduction to those that were unfamiliar and also something for my fans to brag about as opposed to hearing it on the radio and being like ` Ehhh . ' ''
The song 's third verse samples the line `` Now who else wan na f -- k with Hollywood Court -LRB- Cole -RRB- ? ''
by Andre 3000 from Outkast 's song `` SpottieOttieDopalicious . ''
