This was released as the first single from the album .
It has a raw industrial sound and uncompromising lyrics .
In an interview with Pitchfork Media , the interviewer commented that it was an uncompromising comeback single .
Geoff Barrow replied that `` when you come back you do n't want to tickle people under the chin . ''
The rest of the album also has a darker sound than their two previous albums , a BBC reviewer commented that it was n't something she would play at a dinner party .
Geoff Barrow told Q magazine February 2008 about the album 's sound : `` It 's a lot more evil .
It still sounds like us , but there 's some electronic stuff on it too . ''
Guitarist Adrian Utley added to Billboard magazine : `` It sounds nothing like Dummy or Portishead , but it 's definitely its older brother or sister .
It 's the same mindset we 've always had , only further down the road . ''
