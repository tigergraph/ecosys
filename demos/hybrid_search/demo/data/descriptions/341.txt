`` Viginti Tres '' means the number 23 in Latin .
Here 's some translation and interpretation : una Infinitas Abominatio Nascitur Autumno hic est tuum temptamen quod temptat tua potentia viginti tres gradus ad summam potestatem translated : one infinity the horror begins in autumn this is your trial , which tries your -LRB- power , might , ability ; efficacy , potency -RRB- Twenty three steps to total power .
`` The horror '' refers to the end of the world , as told of by Christians .
Why he believes it begins in autumn is anyone 's guess .
The trial he refers to is the time after the rapture , in which there are years of peace created by the anti-christ , and then years of absolute terror .
The twenty-three steps could be a lot of things , including either a random number or the fact that two divided by three is .666 repeating .
666 is the number of the beast , once again according to Christianity .
