This piano ballad quotes from various Biblical scriptures including ones from St Paul 's letter to the Ephesians : `` Be strong in the Lord and power of His might '' and the Gospel of Luke : `` Do good to those who curse you .
Pray for those who mistreat you . ''
Carey also mentions Bible verses from the books of Psalms , Proverbs , John and Philippians .
Carey : '' ' I Wish You Well ' is in the tradition of songs like , I would say , ` Outside , ' ' I Am Free , ' these are album cuts from different albums that unless people are really fans , they wo n't know , but mainly I would say ` Vanishing ' from my first album because it 's just piano and vocal and background vocals .
Basically it 's about coming to a place within yourself where you , no matter what somebody does to you , you can forgive them , and even if you 're a little bit bitter about it , you say your peace and you let it go . ''
This was co-produced by James Poyser .
