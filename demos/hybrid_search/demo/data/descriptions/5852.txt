Speaking with CBC Music , Sexsmith said this was a `` sort of an accidental song . ''
He explained : `` My wife and I went to a friend 's cottage , and I 'm not really an outdoors person .
It was fine and everything , but I was a little bit bored .
I brought my guitar and I started singing this song with the phrase ` lonely avenue , ' but I thought there is already a song called ` Lonely Avenue ' that Doc Pomus wrote .
But it sounded good , so I fiddled around with it and came up with ` If Only Avenue , ' and all of a sudden the light bulb came on over my head and I just started writing , again , a song about regret and things that you ca n't see except in hindsight .
I was just happy to be able to quote ` Heartbreak Hotel ' in the last verse .
It 's always fun when you get to do that .
`` Sexsmith is correct in his recollection .
The Doc Pomus penned song `` Lonely Avenue '' was a rhythm and blues hit for Ray Charles in 1956 .
