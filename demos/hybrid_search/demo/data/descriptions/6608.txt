This tune about a beautiful but dangerous girl is one of a number of tracks on Lines , Vines and Trying Times that features a horn section .
Singer Joe Jonas explained to Rolling Stone that this new sound was inspired by a British band that the brothers came across in 2008 .
Said Joe : `` We were really inspired by the Zutons .
We heard their new record , You Can Do Anything , when we were in Europe last year and got everyone around us hooked on it . ''
Joe added that the brothers kept adding horns to more and more tracks : `` The horns just keep sounding good !
The players are these amazing Minneapolis cats who have been doing it for years and are just unreal . ''
-LRB- Check out The Zutons track `` What 's Your Problem '' -RRB- The brothers penned this with their bass player Greg Garbowsky , who also co-wrote their hit single `` Tonight . ''
Back in 1959 the songwriting team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller wrote a song with the same title for The Coasters .
Both songs employ the same pretty girl-as-irritant metaphor .
