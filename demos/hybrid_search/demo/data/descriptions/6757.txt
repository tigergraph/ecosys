This is the lead single from How To Become a Clairvoyant , the fifth solo album from singer-songwriter and former Band guitarist Robbie Robertson .
Inspiration struck the Canadian in a writing session with his friend Eric Clapton , which yielded three songs and spurred Robertson to write on his own .
The result was the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer 's first release since 1998 's Contact From The Underworld of Redboy .
Robertson performed the song on Late Show With David Letterman and The View in support of How to Become Clairvoyant .
Lyrically much of How To Become a Clairvoyant is focused on remembrances , including The Band years .
Regarding this song , Robertson recalled : `` It was a lifestyle of the time that most of my friends went through .
Some came out the other side , and for some , the train ran off the tracks . ''
How to Become Clairvoyant debuted at # 13 on the Billboard 200 , surpassing the # 38 peak of Robertson 's self-titled 1987 solo debut release , to become the highest-charting album of Robbie Robertson 's solo career .
