Amy Lee revealed to MTV News this song was inspired by the tsunami that hit Japan in 2011 .
She explained : `` When we first got into pre-production , the earthquakes and tsunami happened in Japan , and we were all just totally glued to paying attention to it , all these incredibly heartbreaking images , and we just -LSB- thought -RSB- , ` Wow , ' '' she said .
`` And I was thinking about it a lot .
It was consuming my mind , and we were working on that song at the same time .
I was kind of working on lyrics at night ; we 'd practice all day , and I 'd go home at night and be working on lyrics by myself .
And I came in the next day and was like , ` Guys , I 'm going to make this song about the tsunami ... I was singing it to -LSB- my bandmates -RSB- in the car , and everyone was like , ' I got goose bumps . '
I 'm feeling this human connection with -LSB- the Japan tragedy -RSB- ; obviously , I have n't experienced it , but it was cool to write about something a little bit outside myself , that is n't what I usually do . ''
