This song is about recalling times with a girlfriend and a romantic breakup .
It 's one of the most popular Steely Dan songs , but also one of their least favorite .
In Rolling Stone , September 17 , 2009 , Donald Fagan said , `` It 's dumb but effective . ''
Walter Becker added , `` It 's no fun . ''
Elliot Randall , who was not a member of Steely Dan , stopped by on an invite from Skunk Baxter while they were recording this and ended up playing the guitar solo .
This was one of the first of many times Walter Becker and Donald Fagen would use studio musicians , and by their fourth album , nearly every player was a studio musician .
Randall also played on their albums Katy Lied and The Royal Scam .
-LRB- thanks , Joshua - Seattle , WA -RRB- Randall 's guitar solo earned high praise from Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page .
According to Classic Rock magazine -LRB- January , 1999 -RRB- , Page has said it is his favorite guitar solo of all time .
Steely Dan are known for their meticulous sound - every note must be perfect .
This song is sometimes criticized for bringing on overly polished mainstream '70s music .
