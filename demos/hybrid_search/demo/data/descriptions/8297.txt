Vocalist Guy Garvey recalled this song in a 2009 interview with Drowned in Sound : `` It 's still considered the best song we 've ever written by lots of fans , and I ca n't say I disagree .
It 's memories , snapshots of childhood mixed together in the same way I used to mix together black and white photographs on the floor , to mix up my memories and find inspiration . ''
