The Heavy guitarist Dan Taylor wrote this song with help from their lead singer Kelvin Swaby , who told us : `` It 's a relationship between yourself and whatever the entity is .
But Dan believed that his house was haunted for ` Stuck . '
-LRB- laughing -RRB- Because he just believed there was something in the house .
I just started coming up and he was playing this amazing piano line , and then pretty much within the afternoon , we had it down , we 'd written the beats and written the bass line , and then the vocal literally came within a matter of a day .
I 'd left Daniel after we 'd come and did that work .
And then we came back , and it 's just like he believed the house was haunted , and this is how it manifested itself .
I think ` Stuck ' is a beautiful song . ''
