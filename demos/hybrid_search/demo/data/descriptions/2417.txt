This is the follow-up to London-based singer-songwriter Rox 's debut single `` No Going Back . ''
Like most of her songs it 's based on real events and circumstances and in this instance it manages to convey both shattered heartache and fierce resolve .
Rox 's debut album is titled Memoirs .
She explained why to The Daily Mirror March 12 , 2010 : `` Between 18 and now I grew up quite a lot .
I fell out of love , fell in love with someone else and got hurt .
A lot of the songs come from that .
I went to Mexico to teach and do charity work .
At first , I laughed when people said I would really find myself there , but I did .
It happened .
I wanted to take a rest from music , but there was an abandoned guitar in the college where I was teaching and I wrote lots of songs .
It was a good way for me to get over the hurt .
All the things I could n't say to my ex in person were channeled into the songs .
I 'm very proud , so I hate the idea of someone getting the better of me .
I can admit to it in a song . ''
