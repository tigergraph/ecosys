This song is a tribute to Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy 's father , Howard , who died at the end of 2008 .
In our 2010 interview with Portnoy , he explained : `` My dad was battling cancer throughout the making of this whole record .
So it was something that was a big part of my life , and I was going through it throughout the making of this record .
And sadly , he passed away before the record was finished .
But I wanted to write a song that was a tribute to our life together .
I did n't want to focus on the six months of struggling with cancer and dying , I wanted to focus on the 41 years of great times that we had before that .
And I wrote this song as a tribute to him , and luckily I was able to play it for him before he passed away .
I had a version with me singing , and I played it for him at his bedside , and we held hands and we cried .
One of the most emotional experiences of my life , but something I 'll be eternally grateful for .
You know , a lot of times people write songs for their loved ones after the fact .
But it was a great gift to be able to do this before he passed away , and share it with him . ''
Dream Theater can be described as `` Progressive Metal , '' and their influences include Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin .
Mike Portnoy has his father to thank for exposing him to this music .
He told us : `` He was a huge music fan .
He was the reason I became a musician myself .
When I was born , he was a rock DJ on the radio and surrounded me with the Beatles and the Who and the Stones and Led Zeppelin and stuff like that , from Day One .
And he was a huge Dream Theater fan , he was the one that came up with the name Dream Theater , and was always supportive of us for 25 years , since the beginning .
He loved Dream Theater because he was able to have an appreciation for the type of music we play . ''
