This slow burning swooner was first performed at Thom Yorke 's solo benefit gig for the Green Party in Cambridge in February 2010 .
In his review of The King of Limbs , The Daily Telegraph 's Neil McCormick called this song , `` A campfire lullaby for the end of the world . ''
It appears Yorke is wanting to bring comfort to the many casualties of life in the 21st century -LRB- the `` lost and sold '' -RRB- and gather them in his arms .
However , the victims are resigned to giving `` up the ghost . ''
The King of Limbs refers to an oak tree in southern England , which is thought to be 1,000-years-old and is reputedly Europe 's oldest tree .
Yorke 's lead vocal in this song uses the same reverb as `` House of Cards '' from In Rainbows .
It is a room sample from Tottenham House , which is located three miles from where the veteran tree resides in Silvernape Forest .
