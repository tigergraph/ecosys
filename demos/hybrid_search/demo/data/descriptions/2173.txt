Not to be confused with any later song of the same title , `` China Girl '' runs to 3 minutes 36 seconds and is the first track on Harper 's debut album , Sophisticated Beggar .
Like all the others , it was written by him.Rock fans will probably prefer Bowie 's song of the same name .
So will folk fans .
