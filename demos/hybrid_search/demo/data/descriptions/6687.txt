This salute to war heroes and veterans is a track from American singer-songwriter Josh Groban 's fifth album , Illuminations .
Groban told Artist Direct : `` It came from a trip to Walter Reed Hospital in DC , where I was talking to soldiers .
Theirs is a struggle we ignore as a country - the veterans who come home and fight battles for rest of their lives . ''
