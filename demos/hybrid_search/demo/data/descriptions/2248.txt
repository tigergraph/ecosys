This song with apocalyptic end-of-all-things lyrical content was the first single from Welsh rock band Lostprophets ' fourth studio album , The Betrayed .
The song was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe 's BBC Radio 1 show on August 19 , 2009 .
Frontman Ian Watkins told The Daily Mirror that much of The Betrayed was inspired by a distaste for the modern world .
`` It 's upsetting to watch what 's happening with the dumbing down of society in general , '' he said .
`` People just spend their lives watching other people live their lives . ''
CMU asked guitarist Lee Gaze what inspired The Betrayed .
He replied : `` It was wholly inspired by our personal experiences ; everything we have learnt in the last ten years is in the new album , The Betrayed .
This is the first time that we totally self-worked the album , used my own guitars , my own pedals - everything .
This album is purely us , through and through . ''
