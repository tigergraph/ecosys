Ukulele Songs is the second solo studio album by American singer and Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder .
It comprises original songs and covers all played on the ukulele .
The album was released on May 31 , 2011 .
Vedder explained to Rolling Stone that he decided the build his new songs around the instrument to unify the sound of the record .
He said , `` I just wanted it to be the one sound .
At first it was kind of a joke , and then it became a little bit of a challenge , a puzzle , to see if I could create 11 or 12 songs with just a ukulele .
It 's like painting with one color .
You can really appreciate the subtleties and changes in tone . ''
This paean to patience in love and everything else was inspired by the loyalty shown to Death Row prisoner Damien Echols by his wife Lorri Davis .
Echols is one of the three men , known as the West Memphis Three , who were convicted in the killing of eight-year-olds Steve Branch , Christopher Byers , and Michael Moore at Robin Hood Hills , West Memphis , Arkansas , on May 5 , 1993 .
The case has received considerable attention and many critics charge that the arrests and convictions were a miscarriage of justice .
Echols ' case has seen significant support from numerous musicians , including Vedder .
In 2006 , Echols contributed lyrics to the song `` Army Reserve '' , on Pearl Jam 's self-titled album.Lorri Davis ' devoted efforts to clear her husband 's name were finally rewarded in August 2011 when the West Memphis Three were all freed after spending more than 18 years in prison .
