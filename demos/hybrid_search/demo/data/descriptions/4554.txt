This is the first single from Seeds We Sow , the sixth solo album by American musician and Fleetwood Mac vocalist/guitarist Lindsey Buckingham .
Recorded at his LA home , he played most of the instruments himself .
The record came out on September 6 , 2011 and was his first to be self-released .
The song is about Buckingham 's relationship with his wife , the photographer Kristen Messner .
He explained the song 's meaning in an interview with Spinner : `` I guess that song is about coming to terms with the fact that there are things that are always not going to be comfortable , things that you 're not always going to understand in your life or in your relationship , and that to some degree , you 've got to inject a constant dose of faith into the fact that things will evolve in their own way , in their own time , without you exerting a huge amount of control over the situation .
There is only so much you can control or understand in any given situation , and you 've got to somehow find the balance between being proactive in your involvement in anything and also being a bit passive about letting it have its own life as well . ''
