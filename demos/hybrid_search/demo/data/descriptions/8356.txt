This sketch is about a true incident that happened to Cole when he was behind the wheel of his car .
Seconds after getting a text message from Jay-Z , saying he was signing him to Roc Nation , the excited rapper was pulled over by a cop .
He told Billboard magazine : `` I had so many bench warrants for the dumbest things you can have in New York : hopping turnstiles , drinking in public , all the little stupid stuff you can get tickets for ... and my license was bad , because I had traffic things or whatever .
So the minute I found out I was getting signed ... I literally got pulled over right after that . ''
