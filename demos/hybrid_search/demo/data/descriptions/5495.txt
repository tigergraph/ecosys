Hartman wrote this for the 1984 movie Streets of Fire , where it was performed by the fictional group The Sorels .
The real voice behind the version used in the movie was Winston Ford , but Hartman 's version was the one used on the soundtrack and released as a single .
-LRB- thanks , Michael - San Diego , CA -RRB- In this song , the singer has a case of love-its -LRB- inflammation of the love -RRB- and the only cure is to see his girl again .
If he ca n't be with her , at least he can dream about her .
Kenny Vance was the musical director on Streets of Fire .
He explains : `` The same guy that sings lead on that and ` Countdown To Love , ' a song that I wrote for the film , was a guy working at a Radio Shack -LRB- Winston Ford -RRB- , and I think when you look at the film and The Sorels are singing it live in the movie , that was the version that was supposed to come out , and I recorded that version .
But then when Dan Hartman heard it , I do n't know what happened next , but I know that he took that guy 's voice off and he put his own on , and he had a hit with it .
Hollywood is a very slippery place . ''
