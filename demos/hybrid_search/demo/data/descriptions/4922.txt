Pop/country singer-songwriter Jessie James explained to Artist Direct how she utilized a beat for this song drawn from her own step routine : `` I created that beat myself .
It 's funny , I was on the step team in high school , and I still find myself doing it every now and then .
I was in the vocal booth doing something else and I just started stepping it .
The producer was like , `` We have to record that right now . ''
So we stopped and put the microphone by my feet , and I did the whole step .
We just started writing to it immediately . ''
James told Artist Direct that she is `` not a big fashion girl . ''
She added that when she wrote this song , `` I wanted to write about something that was simple that I wear every day .
They will never go out of style either .
A lot of artists today sing about Gucci and Louis Vuitton , and I just think it 's silly .
I do n't get that much into it .
I 'm a simple dressed girl . ''
This featured on the trailer for the movie Confessions of a Shopaholic before James had even released anything .
She told Artist Direct the use of her song was a surprise : `` I did n't even know the song was in the trailer .
I know they were talking about using it in the movie but no one had told me it was confirmed .
On Christmas Day , I was sitting at home and I got all of these text messages from girlfriends telling me that they 'd gone to see Marley and Me and they heard `` Blue Jeans '' on the Confessions trailer .
I could n't believe it !
I went to go see it that day and it was pretty cool -LSB- Laughs -RSB- . ''
