The English version of this song is called `` Rescue Me '' and appears on Tokio Hotel 's 2007 album Scream .
The song is about feeling helpless after a relationship has just ended .
The singer gave his all but apparently that was n't enough for her -LRB- `` I trusted you in every way but not enough to make you stay '' -RRB- .
He wants her to come back and rescue him , and is haunted by her memory .
-LRB- thanks , Cor - Columbia , SC -RRB-
