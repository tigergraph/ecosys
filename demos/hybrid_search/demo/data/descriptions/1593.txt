This ethereal , post-dubstep track is the first solo single released by Jamie `` xx '' Smith of the Mercury-award winning English indie pop band The xx .
The song was released on June 6 , 2011 on the Numbers label , though Smith actually recorded the track the previous year .
When he premiered it on John Kennedy 's show on Xfm , Smith remarked : `` It 's a tune I made on one of our short breaks from touring and I was eager to make some new music .
I got a steel pan and made this track . ''
