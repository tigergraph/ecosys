Monsters of Folk are an alternative rock band comprising Jim James of My Morning Jacket , Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis of Bright Eyes , and indie singer-songwriter Matt -LRB- M. -RRB- .
Ward .
The foursome originally got together in 2004 during the participants ' collegial 2004 tour but it took them five years to complete their self-titled album .
During its recording the band swapped instruments and shared vocal duties .
Mogis told Express Night Out about the recording of this song : `` It was probably the most fun to do in the studio , that song is actually -LSB- almost -RSB- completely live .
There 's two keyboard overdubs .
Jim 's vocal is a scratch vocal that 's why he counts off .
We all chuckled about it , like that 's cool , let 's leave it that way .
Conor 's drum take is live , my bass is live , Matt 's guitar is live .
Matt did a piano overdub and Jim did that wah overdub .
Outside of that Conor had this memory of like smashing the drums and cymbals and he looked over at Jim - he went into one of his high loud voices things - and Conor felt like part of My Morning Jacket and was super excited .
That one had this feeling of when you start your first band .
Maybe you just took mushrooms and are at band practice in your garage .
It has that innocence of just playing even if you 're not that good at it .
It felt like a first band experience playing that song . ''
