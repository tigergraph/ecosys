This up-tempo cut is the lead single from American Country music artist Sarah Buxton 's self-titled debut album .
Co-writer Mark Hudson co-directed the music video , which was homemade and filmed with a budget of $ 80 .
Buxton told The Boot about the song : `` It 's just a bunch of nonsense , to be honest !
With four songwriters in the room with four strong personalities - me , Victoria Shaw , Mark Hudson , Gary Burr - it was a trainwreck to begin with !
I go , ` Let 's write a song about this bird who just keeps banging into the living room window !
What 's wrong with this bird ?
What 's it thinking ? '
That 's where it began , and we began thinking , ` What if you see this outside your window ?
Maybe you see that outside your window ? '
No matter what you see , you still need stars when you 're wishing at night , a best friend to set you right ... Through the ups and downs , that 's the only thing that 's gotten me through is loving myself and taking care of myself . ''
