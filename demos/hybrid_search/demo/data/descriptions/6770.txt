Frontman and lyricist Chad Gray told Artist Direct that this is probably his all-time favorite Mudvayne song ever .
He explained : `` There 's a lot of outpouring through that song and those character dissections .
That song means a lot to me , and I 'm so glad that it turned out as awesome as it did .
I 'm really proud of that song .
That 's probably my favorite Mudvayne song ever .
It 's saying a lot .
The music is f -- king great .
I 've told Ryan , Matt and Greg , I think that song 's bridge is probably the best piece of music Mudvayne has collectively written .
That bridge alone as a piece of music is f -- kin ' badass to me . ''
