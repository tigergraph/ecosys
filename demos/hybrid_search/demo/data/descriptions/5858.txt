Lead singer Sonny Sandoval : `` This is to the people that live to see you fall .
They bet all their chips on you to lose and to fail .
They just do n't want to see you win .
The main lyric is , ` Let me introduce you to yourself . '
I 'm basically saying , ` If I 'm the bad guy , then who are you ?
The good guy ?
Why do n't you worry about yourself ? ' ''
