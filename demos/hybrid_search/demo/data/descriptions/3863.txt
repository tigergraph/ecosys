`` Lover of the Bayou '' was originally written by Roger McGuinn and Jacques Levy .
McGuinn is better known as the lead singer and guitarist for The Byrds ; Jacques Levy was a songwriter and theater director , who collaborated with McGuinn in 1969 with an interest in making a Broadway musical .
While the musical never saw production , several of the songs survive today as Byrds ' songs .
This is a cover by the band Mudcrutch , better known as Tom Petty 's old band which he reformed in the late 2000s .
The original Byrds ' version of this song may be found on disk two of the album The Essential Byrds , released in 2003 .
It was originally on their untitled album , along with `` Chestnut Mare '' , `` All the Things '' and `` Just a Season '' , also from the would-be musical.If a stage musical sounds unlikely , McGuinn had even bigger plans beyond that to produce a science-fiction film which would have been named Ecology 70 and would have starred ex-Byrd Gram Parsons and ex-Mamas And The Papas Michelle Phillips , as a couple of `` hippies in space . ''
This was a more common idea in the late '60s and early '70s than you might think - witness the 1974 John Carpenter film Dark Star .
If the lyrics sound like they 're full of Freudian symbolism -LRB- `` I learned the key to the master look ; I learned to float in the water clock . '' -RRB-
, that might be because song co-writer Jacques Levy was also a clinical psychologist !
Levy also directed the off-Broadway erotic -LRB- and all-nude -RRB- revue Oh !
Calcutta ! .
