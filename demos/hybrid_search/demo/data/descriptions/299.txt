Running to 2 minutes 31 seconds , this uptempo number has an environmental/contemporary political theme to it : `` burning up the oils and melting down the ice '' is an obvious reference to the depletion of natural resources and global warming .
Although it has an optimistic feel , one ca n't help wondering if Thom , like everyone else , thinks that ultimately the Devil will win .
As usual , the song was recorded in her basement flat in Tooting , South West London .
