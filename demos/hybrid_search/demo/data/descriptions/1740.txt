Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora opens his third solo album Aftermath of the Lowdown with this track , which he wrote with Luke Ebbin .
American producer Ebbin is best known for executing the makeover of Bon Jovi with his production of their multi-million selling album Crush .
Speaking with Artist Direct , Sambora told the story of the song .
`` It started out with me saying to myself , ' I want to write a real barnburner I can jam on ! ' ''
he explained .
`` It 's something that will really work on live basis .
I conjured up the image of burning the candle down as if you were with a girl in a hotel room and you decided to go crazy all night physically and have good time until the candle was burnt down -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
Then , as I was writing it , that one took shape over a few weeks .
At the time , Occupy Wall Street was happening .
It became a little bit of a protest song for me .
I started to feed off that energy .
There was an influence of that .
It became more like , ` Our voice is going to get out , and we 'll burn that candle down . '
Metaphorically speaking , there 's a duality to it . ''
