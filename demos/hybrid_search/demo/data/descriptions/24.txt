The big hit from the Circle of One album was `` Get Here , '' which was written by Brenda Russell , but Adams wrote most of the songs on the album herself , including this one .
Adams relocated to Los Angeles from her native Washington state , which is where this song came about .
She explains in I Got Thunder : Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft : `` I found L.A. a very difficult place to be in .
I was very lonely and I felt that a lot of what the industry folk did made me feel even smaller .
I thought I was going out there to make music in a circle of friends , but I found myself in a circle of one .
So while I was there feeling horrible and writing on my own , ` Circle of One ' came about . ''
