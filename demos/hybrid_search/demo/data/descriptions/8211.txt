Flo Rida told Pyro Radio how their collaboration came about : `` The second single came about through E Class who 's the CEO of Poe Boy Entertainment , he 's great friends with Timbaland , normally you 'd need a $ 100,000 to get into the studio with Timbaland but I found out he 's a fan of me and he had to a favor for his brother E Class , so we were in the studio for four days , for a first time artist that 's unheard of , the first two days I acquainted with him and got to vibe with him and he has a love for music but at the same time me and him have in common that we put God first , the last couple of days we came up with ` Elevator ' and then we shot the video about a week and a half later you got cameos in the video with Rick Ross , Cool and Dre , Lil Boosie , Brisco , Triple C. Working with Timbaland on Elevator was a dream come true , we were both out of the same camp Devante of Jodeci , he was apart of that movement early on and for three years I 've been working with Devante also we have a lot in common .
