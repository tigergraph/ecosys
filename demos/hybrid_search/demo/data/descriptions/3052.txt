This tale of heartbreak was sung by Engelbert Humperdinck for the United Kingdom entry to the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest held in Baku , Azerbaijan .
The BBC unveiled the tune on March 19 , 2012 on their Eurovision homepage.The song ultimately placed 25th out of the 26 songs sung during the Eurovision final .
It received just 12 points - from Estonia , Latvia , Belgium and Ireland .
Swedish born Martin Terefe , who has also worked with Jason Mraz , Jamie Cullum , KT Tunstall and Train , produced the song .
It was co-written by Sacha Skarbek , who also co-penned James Blunt 's `` You 're Beautiful '' and Lana Del Rey 's `` Born to Die . ''
When his participation was announced , the then 75-year-old Humperdinck was set to become the oldest singer to ever participate in the Eurovision Song Contest .
However , shortly afterwards it was announced that Natalya Pugachyova , who is several months older , would represent Russia as part of the band Buranovskiye Babushki , and would take the record as oldest singer in the contest .
Humperdinck still remains both the oldest male and oldest solo singer to take part .
