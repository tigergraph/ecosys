This carol 's melody is from the 16th century song `` Greensleeves . ''
In 1865 the English poet and lay theologian William Chatterton Dix wrote a Christmas poem entitled The Manger Throne and a few years later Sir John Stainer merged 3 verses of Dix 's lyrics and `` Greensleeves '' to produce `` What Child Is This . ''
Dix was born in Bristol , England and attended the Grammar school there .
His surgeon father wrote a biography of the poet Thomas Chatterton , and gave his son his middle name in his honor .
William spent most of his life as manager of a Maritime insurance company in Glasgow , Scotland , but his heart was in the poetry of worship .
He wrote over 40 hymns , including many songs for Christmas and Easter .
Another of his carols that has endured is `` As With Gladness , Men Of Old '' , set to a melody by Konrad Kocher .
The hymns he wrote include `` Alleluia !
Sing to Jesus '' and `` To You Oh Lord Our Hearts We Raise . ''
The carol first appeared as a hymn text in Christmas Carols New and Old -LRB- 1871 -RRB- edited by Stainer and the Reverend H.R. Bramley .
Apart From `` What Child Is This , '' their compilation also included Stainer 's arrangements of what were to become the standard versions of `` God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen , '' `` The First Nowell , '' `` I Saw Three Ships '' and `` Good King Wenceslas '' among others .
