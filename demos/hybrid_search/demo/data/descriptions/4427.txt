Lead singer Sonny Sandoval : `` We know a couple of people that had attempted suicide in the time that we were working on this album .
One was successful , one was n't .
It 's a plea to people that are feeling so lost .
You mean so much more , not only to the people that love you , but to the God that created you .
This world is just not worth it . ''
