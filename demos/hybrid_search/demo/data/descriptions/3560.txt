Nash explained on her website that this punk-based song was written , recorded and videoed in 24 hours as a means of battling frustration .
`` The other night I was stressin ' out , '' she said , `` and we 'd just finished rehearsing and I was like ARGHGHHGHGH I need to write a song and release something and do something creative instead of breaking all my stuff that I own . ''
`` The next day I did a couple of interviews and then went straight to work , '' Nash continued .
`` The girls were kinda like `` what who how when and what the crap are you talking about ?! '' and I was like `` no time to explain just trust me and when we 've finished this will be a new song .
`` Nash concluded : `` We recorded it , then started shooting a video at 10.00 pm and proceeded to get pretty silly until about 4.00 am and run around being di -- s and having fun all over poor Oscar and Steve 's -LRB- the owners -RRB- practice rooms .
There was beer , there was cheesecake , there was dancing with dogs , there was a LOT OF SHOUTING .
I felt a lot better . ''
Nash complains in the opening verse that everybody plays it safe and nobody messes with the rules .
Speaking with The Observer , she explained the lyrics sum up her feeling towards a lot of things , including the current music industry .
`` When I first started , in 2006 , '' she explained , `` it was an exciting time .
Independent , cool , weird artists were being successful , and magazines were writing about them , and people were getting played on radio that were , like , really good .
And now everything I hear on the radio is basically a dance track .
People have these amazing platforms , and I feel they could do something more interesting .
They probably have the talent to do something more interesting , but there 's a lot of fear .
You have to conform to certain things just to get on the -LSB- radio -RSB- playlists . ''
The song introduces a new back-to-basics rock sound for Nash .
Explaining why she has shifted to punk-based material , she said : `` I 've been hurt and I 'm angry and playing bass and shouting about it makes me feel better .
That 's all it is .
And if that freaks people out then good . ''
