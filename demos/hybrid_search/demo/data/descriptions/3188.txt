Alabama Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard had a happy childhood until the age of 7 when her sister fell ill .
`` She was quite sick before she died , '' the singer told NME .
`` It was something we had to live with every day and it was really strange .
It changed my life forever .
I felt like there 's always someone looking out for me and that 's why good things happen to me .
It makes me look at people different and look at myself differently .
It did n't hit me until years later .
When I was younger everyone was sad and I did n't want to be sad .
It did n't hit me until I was 10 or so .
`` This album closer is dedicated to Brittany 's fallen sister .
