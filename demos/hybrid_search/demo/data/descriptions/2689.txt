Radiohead premiered this song at the sold-out American Airlines Arena in Miami on February 27 , 2012 .
Though the song 's electronic-focused polyrhythmic chaos are typical of Radiohead 's 21st century oeuvre , its competing vocal lines are something more novel for the band .
The song was one of two completed during Radiohead 's visit to Jack White 's Third Man Studios .
Thom Yorke told Rolling Stone : `` It was only a few hours in the studio .
It was just because ` Identikit ' felt like it was in a really nice place , and I wanted to lay it down before we got bored of it , which is what normally happens .
And there was one other tune , which might work .
But ` Identiki ' '' was the main thing . ''
