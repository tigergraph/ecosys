According to Neville Judd 's authorized biography Al Stewart : The True Life Adventures of a Folk Rock Troubadour , this is based rather loosely on Dr. Josef Mengele , the so-called Angel of Death from the Auschwitz concentration camp .
He was probably the most notorious Nazi to avoid capture after the Second World War .
After fleeing to South America he became a citizen of Paraguay but eventually moved to Brazil where he drowned in an accident in 1979 .
