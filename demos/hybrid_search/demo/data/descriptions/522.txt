Blur guitarist Graham Coxon and vocalist Damon Albarn debuted this song during War Chid 's benefit concert at London 's Shepherds Bush Empire on February 19 , 2012 .
`` It 's a new song we wrote just up the road a couple of weeks ago , '' Albarn told the crowd .
`` It 's got a lot of words , not as many as Ed Sheeran but a lot . ''
It marked Blur 's first new song since the 2010 Record Store Day release of `` Fool 's Day . ''
The single was recorded live in one take .
`` It 's the first Blur song where it 's been one take , because previously I never finished the lyrics before we recorded - which is quite nice , because I do n't really see any more recordings after this , '' Albarn told The Guardian .
The Westway is a two-and-a-half mile long elevated dual carriageway section of the A40 road in west London running from Paddington to North Kensington .
It was constructed to relieve congestion at Shepherd 's Bush caused by traffic from Western Avenue struggling to enter central London on roads of insufficient capacity .
Blur previously referred to the route on their song `` For Tomorrow , '' where Albarn describes a couple lost on the road .
`` London 's so nice back in your seamless rhymes , '' he sings .
`` But we 're lost on the Westway .
`` West London band The Clash also gave the road a mention in their 1977 track `` London 's Burning . ''
Joe Strummer sings sarcastically : `` I 'm up and down the Westway , in and out the lights .
What a great traffic system , it 's so bright .
I ca n't think of a better way to spend the night , than speeding around underneath the yellow lights . ''
In addition , the punk quartet titled their 2000 Grammy-winning documentary Westway To The World .
The song peaked at # 34 in the UK , Blur 's lowest-charting single since `` She 's So High '' reached # 48 in 1990 .
