This tearjerker was penned by Country music singer Josh Thompson .
Raised in Wisconsin , Thompson speaks for the common man and his struggles on many of his compositions .
This song is about the point where you 've hit bottom .
When he asked Thompson about the inspiration , he said : `` Loud preachers in real life , '' adding , `` you know , the people that try to point out to you that maybe your way of living is n't correct .
There are a lot of people that are going through a really hard time in this country and they do n't need somebody to tell them that they can look forward to going to hell when they die , because they 're living it . ''

Paisley told Billboard magazine the song makes reference to , `` a person in church saying , ' I do n't need to hear about the consequences of my life - I 'm living those consequences .
Tell me about the upside of me sitting in this pew . '
That 's as country as it gets . ''
Josh Thompson got quite emotional when Paisley told him he was going to cut his tune .
Paisley had a `` hold '' on the song , meaning he had the unofficial rights to it while he decided whether to record it or not .
This can be frustrating for songwriters , since it keeps them from shopping these songs to other artists .
Paisley gave Josh the good news that he would record the song when they were on the last date of the H20 tour in Denver .
