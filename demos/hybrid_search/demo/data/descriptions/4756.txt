British indie rock band Wild Beasts were formed in 2002 in the north western England town of Kendal , by Queen Katherine School students Hayden Thorpe -LRB- vocals -RRB- and Ben Little -LRB- guitar -RRB- .
They originally performed under the name of Fauve , the French term for `` wild beast '' .
In January 2004 , schoolmate Chris Talbot -LRB- drummer -RRB- joined , and they changed the band 's name to Wild Beasts .
The following year another student , Tom Fleming -LRB- bass -RRB- , became a full time member of the band .
After A-levels , they all decamped to Leeds , where three of them enrolled at the city 's university whilst Little worked at odd jobs.After signing with Domino Records in February 2007 Wild Beasts released their debut album Limbo , Panto the following year .
The band 's sophomore release Two Dancers was widely acclaimed and The Fly magazine voted it as their Best Album of 2009 .
This take on love and its collateral damage is the opening track from their third long player , Smother , which was released on May 9 , 2011 .
Tom Fleming told the story of the song in an interview with Drowned in Sound : `` This began life as a much fuller arrangement , one that was a sort of amalgamation of all the things that might be called our signifiers .
Naturally , upon realising this , we sickened ourselves and set about changing it .
This was really built in the studio from start to finish , the only things kept from the first tentative version being Hayden 's original melody and the chord sequence .
My part is one , unchanging chord . ''
