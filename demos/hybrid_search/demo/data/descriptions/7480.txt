In 2003 The Cribs , three brothers from Wakefield in the UK north , scraped together # 1,000 and booked a week in London 's eight-track Toe Rag Studios to lay down their eponymous debut album .
It was the same studio where The White Stripes ' recorded Elephant in two weeks during April 2002 .
Bassist Gary Jarman recalled to NME in February 2013 : `` The piano at the end of ` Third Outing ' you hear as the feedback 's fading out is the piano used on Elephant .
The music that we 're playing is actually this concept that me and Ryan -LRB- Jarman , vocals -RRB- had at college : national anthems for countries that did n't exist .
We were gon na invent the countries and flags and write the anthems .
That piano is the national anthem of the country of Old Shemock .
Which never existed . ''
