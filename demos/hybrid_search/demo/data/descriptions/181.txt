This is the lead single from The Minutes , Alison Moyet 's eighth studio album .
The record reached # 5 on the UK Albums Chart , Moyet 's highest placing for a studio long player in over 25 years .
Regarding the song 's meaning , Moyet explained : `` The song is about how you use different language in songs as you grow older and how you relate to it . ''
This song , along with the rest of the album , was produced by Guy Sigsworth , who has worked with Seal -LRB- `` Crazy '' -RRB- , Bj√∂rk -LRB- `` It 's Oh So Quiet '' -RRB- and Madonna -LRB- `` What It Feels Like For A Girl '' -RRB- .
Moyet told Digital Spy that Sigsworth was the perfect fit for her .
`` He started off as a harpsichordist at Cambridge University so he really knows his stuff , '' she explained , `` but he 's also really techy , which is a rare combination to find .
I was disappointed with a lot of tech music in the '90s because vocals were often jammed in for the sake of it , whereas Guy really crafts a voice around it . ''
Moyet 's youngest daughter , Caitlin , features in the music video , which was shot on Southend Pier .
The singer explained her daughter 's involvement to Digital Spy : `` I thought it would be a good idea because the song is about two voices , '' she said , `` which is something I 'm really aware of these days .
Nothing pisses me off more than being called an '80s singer - especially as I started in the '60s .
`` Moyet added : `` It was a funny video shoot as they spent hours doing our hair and then it pissed it down ! ''
