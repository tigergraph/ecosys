This song is about teenage pregnancy .
It tells the story about a young girl who gets pregnant , and her boyfriend and family do n't care , hence the lyrics , `` If you were here I 'd never have a fear .
So go on live your life .
But I miss you more than I did yesterday . ''
The lines , `` Well do n't I look pretty walking down the street in the best damn dress I own '' indicate that the girl is full of herself and thinking she 's really pretty so that any guy will like her .
`` We are young and we do n't care .
Your dreams and your hopeless hair .
We never wanted it to be this way for all our life '' is saying that she 's young and does n't care what she does , but she did n't want to be like that all her life and now she 's pregnant .
