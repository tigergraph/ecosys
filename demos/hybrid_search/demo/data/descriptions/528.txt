This tear-jerking album closer concerns one of the most painful periods of Maguire 's life to date .
She explained to The Sun : `` I wrote that a week after my grandfather passed away .
It was the hardest time of my life .
I wanted to write something that was a dedication to him and to the Ireland he came from .
So I wrote the lyrics and based the music on ` The Parting Glass , ' which is a traditional folk song he loved .
I love Johnny Cash .
And I wanted to imitate the reeling you get on his records that he 's almost talking directly to you when he sings . ''
