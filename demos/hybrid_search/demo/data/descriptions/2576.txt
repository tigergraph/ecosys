This fun-loving cut finds the song 's protagonist taking a little ride in a truck with the one that he loves after a hard week 's work .
`` Ca n't wait for the sun to go down .
Roll into town .
Shine the old truck up , '' Aldean sings .
`` I thought this would be a great lead single to come with after ` Fly Over States . '
It 's about grabbing your girl and getting lost in the country .
Sounds like a pretty good Friday night to me !
, '' he explained .
The song was released on July 16 , 2012 .
The song debuted at # 12 on the Hot 100 .
Its quick journey into the upper reaches of the chart earned Aldean his best ever arrival , overtaking the # 54 start for `` My Kinda Party '' in 2009 .
The song became Jason Aldean 's eighth country # 1 on the chart dated October 6 , 2012 .
It climbed to the top in just its tenth week on the tally , the quickest ascent since Blake Shelton 's `` Honey Bee '' also buzzed to the top in its 10th frame in June 2011 .
The tune was penned by New Jersey native Dylan Altman -LRB- Jake Owen 's `` Barefoot Blue Jean Night '' -RRB- , Texan Rodney Clawson -LRB- Blake Shelton 's Drink On It '' -RRB- and New Orleans-born Jim McCormick -LRB- Brantley Gilbert 's `` You Do n't Know Her Like I Do '' -RRB- .
The first seven days digital sales figure of 189,000 , marked the largest debut sales week for a digital song by a male country artist bettering Scotty McCreery 's `` I Love You This Big , '' which launched with 171,000 in June 2011 .
Aldean told Billboard magazine he first heard the tune when recording his 2010 My Kinda Party set .
`` It came in on the last album , but we had all our tempos , '' he said .
`` I liked it , but we were n't looking for that type of song at that time .
It was one of those songs that just kept hangin ' around , and I was still listening to it two years later , still diggin ' it .
At that point it was time to put it on a record . ''
