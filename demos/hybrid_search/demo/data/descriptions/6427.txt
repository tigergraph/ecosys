This hook heavy tune was the lead single from American Christian rock band Skillet 's eighth studio album , Awake .
This song , along with the rest of the album was helmed by the Grammy-nominated producer Howard Benson -LRB- Daughtry , My Chemical Romance , The All American Rejects -RRB- .
Frontman John Cooper told StereoTruth.net : `` This song is the platform over which the whole record was written .
Basically every day seems to get weirder , darker and scarier with thousands of people losing their homes and hurting over a wide variety of reasons .
You see so much negativity on the news , especially this sense of violence that 's getting really crazy .
With all this going on , it 's easy to feel on the edge , but no matter how dark it gets , there 's always hope in a new day and staying positive is the first step .
And when you boil it all down , Christ is the one who gives us a reason to live and He 's our ` Hero ' who 's fighting for all of this oppression and injustice . ''
