This uplifting song envisions a world where the beauty shines through , a place free from greed or oppression .
In many ways , the song personifies what the band is all about , and it was accordingly chosen as the title for Fishbone documentary Everyday Sunshine , released in 2010 .
In the film , we hear from the likes of George Clinton , Flea and Les Claypool , who expound on just how good these guys really are .
It becomes clear that the band 's nirvana - their `` Everyday Sunshine '' - is on stage .
Their problems stem from band dynamics and a musical style that never fit a convenient niche , hamstringing their commercial fortunes .
The song was written by lead singer Angelo Moore and keyboard/trombone player Chris Dowd .
In our 2013 interview with Moore , he explained how it happened : `` That 's a Sly Stone influenced song .
Chris Dowd wrote that one .
He wrote the first half and I wrote the end .
It was a church-style song .
We were just going into it , man .
Because back then we were emulating a lot of our favorite bands : The Specials , Sly Stone , Funkadelic , James Brown , Led Zeppelin , all those people .
All those different styles would pop up while we were doing different jams .
Rick James was another one .
We be playing Rick James up in there . ''
