On several Light tracks , including this Folk-tinged song , Matisyahu abandons the Rap-style vocal approach he previously used and instead tries his hand at singing .
He told Billboard magazine : `` A person 's voice has a natural tendency to it - you listen to different artists , you listen to different people , and you start to subconsciously mold your voice to how you like it - even if its not the natural way to it .
So , I spent all this time listening to Bob Marley , a lot of dance hall - and when I started writing raps and rhymes , it started coming out sounding like a version of those artists .
I spent the last four years seriously working on my voice : taking lessons and trying to rediscover my natural voice . ''
