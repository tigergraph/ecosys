This haunting , jazzy number includes a clarinet solo from English multi-instrumentalist Duke Garwood .
The dark video was directed by Gergely Wootsch .
It was the first music clip by the Hungarian animator , whose short The Hungry Corpse , played at the 2013 London Animation Festival .
Producer Steve Smith told Promo News : `` Gergely went to a Savages gig before production and realised the raw energy the band communicated was essential to communicate in the clip too .
He tried to keep this in mind all the way through the production . ''
Savages guitarist Gemma Thompson came up with the video concept based on Kurt Vonnegut 's time-travelling anti-war novel Slaughterhouse Five about the terrible impact of the bombing of Dresden at the end of World War 2 , The clip focuses on a woman in a munitions factory and the destruction wreaked by the bomb she made .
She explained to NME : `` Two or three years ago I read Slaughterhouse Five , and there 's one scene in particular that replayed in my head .
The main character , Billy Pilgrim , becomes unstuck in time and loses his grip on reality .
There 's a war film playing backwards on his TV , so the bombs are being sucked out from the city , back into the bombers . ''
The goth-cabaret number is about Field Marshal Rommel , a Nazi who was part of a failed German command unit attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler .
Vocalist Jehnny Beth explained to NME : `` He was very famous and it was difficult for Hitler to execute him outright , so he sent officers to his house saying that if he did n't get into their car and take these cyanide pills , they 'd kill his family .
He had 15 minutes to do it . ''
So how does the video link with the song ?
Thompson explained to NME : `` It 's about Field Marshall Rommel , who was part of a group that tried to assassinate Hitler .
He was caught , and was quietly given 15 minutes to take his own life .
So it 's a very dark song about these 15 minutes . ''
