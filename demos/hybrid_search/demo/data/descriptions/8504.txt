This is the third single from British grime artist Tinch Stryder 's second studio album Catch 22 .
This was Tinchy Stryder 's second UK chart-topper and the first # 1 for a Sugababe outside their work with the group .
Stryder 's labelmate , Amelle Berrabah of the Sugababes , is a guest vocalist on this track .
It was Tinchy 's first female collaboration since making the big time and some critics accused Stryder of selling out by collaborating with a pop singer .
He insisted to The Sunday Times July 19 , 2009 : `` My fans wo n't have a problem with Amelle They know I would n't duet with a pop star just for the sake of it .
The song needed a sweet-sounding girl , and Amelle 's voice fitted the part perfectly .
It was n't even a case of getting any Sugababe - it had to be her .
Will my fans start buying Sugababes songs now ?
I 've no idea , but I hope some of their fans will be buying mine . ''
Stryder explained to Digital Spy the story behind this song : `` When you first hear it , it sounds like I 'm talking about never leaving a girl .
But I 'm really talking about where I 've come from .
I 'm saying I 've been around the world and seen so many places , but I 'm never gon na leave .
I think it 's always important to remember your roots . ''
