Frontman Dan Chandler explained the song to AntiMusic : `` This was one of the first songs we recorded for the album .
I felt like it could easily be identified by anyone .
It 's about having someone in your life that you are simply better off without .
We 've all gone through the same story of some miserable person trying to hold us down ... until you finally open your eyes and realize that not only are you better off without them , but you can clearly see right through them .
You stand up and say ` I 'm done with this s -- t ' ... You finally realize that there is no such thing as changing someone - they are who they are .
Keep moving forward - no more walking on egg shells - no more trying to please someone who will never be pleased ... and at the end of the day , this song is all about removing the weight from your shoulders , opening your eyes , throwing up a middle finger , and taking control of your own life . ''
