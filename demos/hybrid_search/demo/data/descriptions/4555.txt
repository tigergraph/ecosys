This sermon on the pitfalls of fame was originally written by Brown and his songwriting partner Dave McCracken for Kanye West 's 2008 album , 808 's And Heartbreak .
Brown explained : `` Dave was asked to write a song for Kanye West .
Amanda Ghost wrote the melody , Dave wrote the music and they wanted me to write some lyrics .
It had to be a sort of autobiographical song for Kanye .
So we had a few meetings and Amanda told me about Kanye because she knew him .
So she texted him and told him I would do the lyrics and he was delighted . ''
However , the track missed the deadline for inclusion on the album and instead Brown chose to keep it for himself .
