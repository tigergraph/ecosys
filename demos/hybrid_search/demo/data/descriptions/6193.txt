This song incorporates material from producer , remixer and M.I.A. collaborator Diplo , who lives in Roots drummer and producer ?
uestlove 's Philadelphia neighborhood .
`` We 've always talked about working , '' ?
uestlove told Spinner , `` and he let me hear a very early mix of the Major Lazer project .
He was just going through some stuff , and -LSB- I said -RSB- , ` Auto-Tuned baby ?
What the hell 's that ? '
He 's like , ` It 's nothing . '
He was looking for another track and I was like , ` No , let me have that s -- . '
He gave me three minutes of a baby crying in Auto-Tune and I manipulated it and created the track .
I did n't even expect the guys -LSB- in The Roots -RSB- to get into it -- I just thought it was hilarious .
They instantly started rhyming to it .
Even then , I was so nervous about it that I made it the last cut on the record , as a means to separate it .
It turned out to be one of people 's favorite cuts . ''
