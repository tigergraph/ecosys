The Pistol Annies are an all-female trio comprising Kentuckian Angaleena Presley , Texas native Miranda Lambert and Tennessee-born Ashley Monroe .
Lambert told Billboard magazine that she feels she 's `` made a niche for myself in my solo career as a little bit of a rocker chick , '' so she was glad to get back to her more Country side with Pistol Annies .
The House That Built Me singer added , `` With this project my country roots really come out .
There are three country girls who are writing about real life situations .
We 'll all from different places in the South but we all come from the same background . ''
Presley came up with the idea for the song when , while driving on her home state 's Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway , she found herself lying under her car on the side of the road securing its muffler with a guitar string .
`` My muffler was literally dragging the ground , but still attached , '' Presley recalled to Cowboys and Indians magazine .
`` So I just thought about it , clipped a string off my guitar , got down there and tied that sucker up .
`` Coal Miner 's daughter Presley noted that her resourcefulness came quite naturally .
`` I 'd grown up as my dad 's little helper .
So I 'm pretty handy around the house .
He 'd taught me how to fix things , make something out of nothing , solve problems . ''
The Pistol Annies debuted the song in front of Lambert 's hometown crowd during her Cause for the Paws event on April 30 , 2011 at the Villa Di Felicita in Tyler , Texas .
