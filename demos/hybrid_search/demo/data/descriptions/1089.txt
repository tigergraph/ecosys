The flower merchants who you sometimes catch at stoplights inspired this song .
Nick Lowe told KLRU : `` I pulled up at a spotlight , a gentleman approached my car and shoved a bunch of flowers towards me .
I was struck by the thought that if you bought some flowers from one of these guys and gave them to someone and said , ` Look , I 'm really sorry , ' it would make it much worse , it would be a sort of insult . ''
The Old Magic was Lowe 's thirteenth solo album .
Lowe told The Huffington Post that the album was the result of an `` ongoing work '' : `` Well , I tend not to record albums as a ` piece ' because I 'm not really that prolific .
I 'll wait until I 've got three or four tunes , and then I 'll round everybody up and we 'll go record them .
Then , quite a long time might go by before I 've got three or four more that I think can turn out okay .
So , it 's not really a project , each record .
It 's more of an ongoing work .
Yeah , that 's really how it works . ''
Lowe told KLRU that although the song came to him very easily , the title did not : `` The hardest part was thinking about what to call it .
In the UK we call them ` traffic lights , ' but that does n't exactly spring off the tongue .
But then I thought , ` Ah , in the States they call them ` spotlights . ' ''
