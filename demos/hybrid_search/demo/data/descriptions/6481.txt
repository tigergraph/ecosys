Scotty explained why this Michael Dulaney , Neil Thrasher and Tony Martin penned cut `` passed the mama crying test . ''
Said the American Idol champ : `` We would get a bunch of songs in and we would all sit down and listen to them as a family .
If Mama heard it and she started crying , I would tell Universal , ` It passed the mama crying test so it must be a good one . ' ''
The song manages to express a positive message in a non-clich√©d way .
Said Scotty : `` It 's about a family sitting down to dinner and mama sits down and she prays and thanks the Lord for things in life that would normally annoy somebody , like slamming doors , dirty dishes and loud kids .
But it shows that you should be grateful in life and not take things for granted .
It says slamming doors means you live in a warm and loving home and noisy kids just mean they are happy kids .
It 's a cool and different way of looking at life and reminds you not to take life for granted and to be thankful for things that might otherwise bother you . ''
