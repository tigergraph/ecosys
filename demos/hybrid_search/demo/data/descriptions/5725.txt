Hall wrote some not-so-complimentary things about Ferry in the book .
-LRB- thanks , Thomas - Marion , IN -RRB- Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies appear in the video .
Clearly , Ferry featured them to draw attention to the song 's theme .
Keeler is the Monica Lewinski of England , and the scandal that she and Rice-Davies started , which became known as The Profumo Affair -LRB- after John Profumo , the British Secretary of State for War -RRB- , was a major story .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA , for above 2 -RRB- This was used as the theme song to the film Bright Lights , Big City , adapted from the popular Jay McInerney novel .
