Rihanna sampled Ginuwine 's 1996 raunchy R&B hit `` Pony '' for this song , cutting its blatantly sexual chorus with a dubstep breakdown .
Ginuwine told MTV News that the main reason he okayed the borrowing of the track was because it was Rihanna .
`` You know what ?
My management told me she wanted to use it , and Rihanna , I 'm a fan of hers and I love what she 's doing .
Anytime someone uses anything that I 've done in the past , that 's just one of those things where the respect is there and I can appreciate that and it was a great song and still is , '' he said .
`` It 's one of the most appreciated songs when I do my shows , that 's one of the songs that gets the most reaction , and for her doing it , I 'm appreciative .
I thank her for it and hopefully it does well for her . ''
This song finds Rihanna reuniting with Chase and Status .
The British Dubstep duo previously helmed three tracks on Rihanna 's fourth album , Rated R , including the single , `` Wait Your Turn '' as well as the Talk That Talk bonus track , `` Red Lipstick . ''
Ginuwine 's lyrics play up his prowess as a lover so Rihanna needed to put a gender-bending spin on its chorus to make it her own .
`` Well I think it was a universal type song anyway , but you can just flip it just like I know she did it , '' he said .
`` If anybody in the business can capture the spirit of ` Pony , ' it would have to be Rihanna . ''
