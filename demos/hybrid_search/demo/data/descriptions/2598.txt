Brett Eldredge 's breakthrough hit tells the story of a staffer at a nursing home .
One of the patients there has Alzheimer 's disease and she mistakes the staffer for her deceased son Raymond .
`` My grandmother had Alzheimer 's , '' Eldredge told Radio.com `` and I wrote that song from the experience of watching her go through it . ''
Eldredge told American Songwriter magazine the story of the song .
`` I wrote it with a guy named Brian Christler , '' he said .
`` I told him about what my grandmother was going through and how torn up I was about that , and I had no idea that we were going to write a song called ` Raymond , ' but it just came out and it was real . ''
