Vocalist Brandon Boyd came up with the original suggestion for this song before the rest of the band took over .
Guitarist Mike Einziger explained in an interview with Rock Sound magazine : '' ` Thieves ' is actually based on an idea that Brandon came up with on his own .
He had written lyrics , a melody and a bass line , and this song emerged from the nugget of an idea that he had .
It was actually one of the first times we had written a song like that ; it was really exciting , particularly for Brandon to see his musical idea be made into something bigger .
At first the song did n't really have a direction , but then , all of a sudden , we were jamming together as a whole band , and the chorus came together .
Most of our songs have been born that way - through jam sessions as a band .
The essence of the lyrics stayed the same throughout the process ; the notion of a quintessential God-fearing white American , and I think anyone with a sense of creativity can relate to that . ''
