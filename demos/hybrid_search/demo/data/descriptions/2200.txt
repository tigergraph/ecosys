The origins of this song lie in a soundcheck .
Singer-guitarist Alex Trimble told NME : `` Sam -LRB- Halliday , lead guitar -RRB- was playing this kind of Celtic riff and we just started jamming , then we took it home and worked on it .
It 's the most melancholic song on the record .
It 's about the first time we moved to London and we had a horrible little flat -- it just was n't a nice place to be . ''
