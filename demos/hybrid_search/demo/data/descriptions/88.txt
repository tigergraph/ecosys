This song alludes to John Lennon 's `` lucky break '' - meaning The Beatles , and how he subsequently `` broke it in two . ''
It also takes barbs at John and Yoko 's self-images as important political figures .
Lennon retorted with a fiery condemnation of Paul on the album Imagine in a track called `` How Do You Sleep ? ''
in which Lennon says , `` The only thing you 've done was yesterday , and since you 've gone you 're just another day . ''
This references the song `` Yesterday , '' and a post-Beatles McCartney piece titled `` Another Day . ''
-LRB- thanks , Boob - Jackford , ME -RRB- McCartney decided to refrain from direct name-calling in this song and softened the original chorus line of `` Yoko took your lucky break and broke it in two '' to `` You took your lucky break ... '' The lyrics , `` Too many people preaching practices '' is a direct reference to John Lennon and Yoko Ono .
John thought other lines in the song were about him as well.In an interview with the October 2010 edition of Mojo magazine , McCartney said : '' ` Too many people preaching practices . '
I felt that was true of what was going on with John .
` Do this , do that , do this , do that . ' ''
This was used as the B-side of the `` Uncle Albert - Admiral Halsey '' single .
