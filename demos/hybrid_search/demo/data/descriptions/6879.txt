Written by Calexico lead singer Joey Burns , `` Slowness '' contains references to their home base of Tucson , Arizona .
Gates Pass is a road known for its scenic views , and Signal Hill is a trail in Saguaro National Park .
The song is about two people coming together from far away .
This song had the honor of being played in space .
Calexico 's congresswoman at the time , Gabrielle Giffords , is a big fan of the band , so when her husband Mark Kelly was aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery in 2008 , she had NASA play their song `` Crystal Frontier '' as his wake-up call .
In early 2011 , Giffords was shot in the head by a lunatic gunman , but survived .
A few months later , when Kelly returned to space aboard the Shuttle Endeavour , Giffords was recovering so Kelly asked the band for a song to play .
They picked `` Slowness '' - Joey Burns told us why : `` It was more mellow , more romantic .
It 's a song that points out places in the Southwest .
There 's a clip on YouTube somewhere .
It 's a video of NASA control , and the operator is on with Mark up in space and you hear this song bouncing back through the wireless speakers and it 's fantastic , beautiful .
It 's got this haunting quality to it , which is something I like in some of our music -- not all of it -- but some of it .
That kind of melancholic or bittersweet sound .
It fits in that genre that 's hard to pinpoint because so many different cultures and countries tap into a similar vibe .
They all have different names for it .
I guess ours in melancholy . ''
