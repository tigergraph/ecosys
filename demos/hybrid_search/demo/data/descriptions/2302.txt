This is the second of a two part song about the plight of the Native American .
Drummer Michael Miley explained its background to Artist Direct : `` The lyrical content is really heavy .
The dude is going to hunt for buffalo and sees the tracks from the army 's wagon headed for the camp from yesterday .
You made it home , but your horse is dead and there are burning bodies lying around .
Part 2 , we 're dealing with godless men over and over again .
It 's a paradox because the white man kept calling the Indians , ` Godless ' and ` dirt worshippers . '
When really , here are these totally spiritual beings who are one with the earth and do n't leave a trace , and the white man comes in and calls them , ` Godless . '
They 're really godless .
Part 2 is about the revenge .
` We 're taking lives at dawn . '
They 'd stake out the army camps , attack in the morning , and scalp heads .
It 's the answer to Part 1 . ''
