This song features a sample of Rodgers & Hart 's `` My Funny Valentine , '' and was inspired by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk , whom Tricky dated for a time during an intense and very public time for both of them .
He told The Guardian : `` Björk had a terrible relationship with me .
I was n't any good for her , but she used to play me Chet Baker 's version of that song .
So that 's me trying to salvage something beautiful from a very bad relationship .
Not her being bad , me .
I could n't see how good to me she was and how good for me she was .
I wish I could say that to her now . ''
