White sings of heartbreak on this piano-and-acoustic march .
When asked during a pre-release playback for Blunderbuss in London , whether the song is autobiographical , White was unwilling to divulge . ''
` Hypocritical Kiss ' was just an interesting narration , '' he explained .
`` When you 're a songwriter you get to choose who narrates the tale -- first person , third person , male or female .
Sometimes you can confuse the listener , and that 's what I wanted to do in that song . ''

The vocal narrative darts between two different perspectives .
White told NME : `` The narration flips halfway from male to female .
It 's so the other songs on this record , when it sounds like it 's a male accusing a female of doing something , I can just as easily say the guy 's doing it to the girl . ''
