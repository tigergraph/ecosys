`` Alien '' , a song written by Thriving Ivory keyboard player Scott Jason , is only found on the 2008 release of their self-titled album and not the 2003 Indie release .
Jason says that this `` is the most personal song to me on the record .
That song is about my brother .
And my brother , he 's a brilliant , brilliant , brilliant kid , a full scholarship to Berkeley , and he 's gone through some pretty heavy stuff .
So that song is really personal . ''
In our Songfacts interview , Jason goes on to say about `` Alien '' : `` It makes me sad when I listen back to it , but it also makes me proud .
And it 's just very emotional , that song .
And people that know me knew when I wrote that what it was about .
My friends , they knew in one second what it was about . ''
