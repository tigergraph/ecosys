This is the first single from singer-songwriter Kate Bush 's tenth studio album , 50 Words For Snow .
The radio edit was debuted on BBC Radio 2 's Ken Bruce Show on October 10 , 2011 , and the 7:16 long single was released the following day .
Stories of the Yeti first emerged in Western popular culture during the 19th century .
The first reliable report appeared in 1925 when a Greek photographer , N. A. Tombazi , working as a member of a geological expedition in the Himalayas , saw a creature at about 15,000 ft -LRB- 4,600 m -RRB- near Zemu Glacier .
When he asked the locals what the beast was that he 'd just seen they told him it was a `` Kanchenjunga demon . ''
-LRB- The Kangchenjunga is the third highest mountain in the world after Mount Everest and K2 -RRB- .
Western interest in the Yeti peaked in the 1950s particularly after Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reported seeing large footprints resembling those of a large bear while scaling Mount Everest in 1953 .
At a 2011 conference in Russia , participating scientists and enthusiasts declared having `` 95 % evidence '' of the Yeti 's existence .
Bush explained to Mojo magazine why she depicts the yeti-like creature in such empathetic terms : `` In our contemporary world , things of mystery are even more precious than they ere before the internet and I think it would be really terrible if that mystery was taken away from us , do n't you ?
It 's really important . ''
The song is about the existence of the Yeti , a large manlike or apelike animal that is said to inhabit the Himalayas .
Bush is warning the woolly creature to beware of humans : `` They want to know you , '' she sings .
`` They will hunt you down/Then they will kill you . ''
The song features backing vocals from former Amen Corner singer Andy Fairweather Low .
