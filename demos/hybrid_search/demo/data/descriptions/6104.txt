Kelly Jones comments in The Sun newspaper , October 12 , 2007 : `` I love the song ` Bank Holiday Monday ' as it applies to what happened to us .
It 's about cheap drugs and a Pound for a can of Stella .
And the night would always end in a fight because someone had caught someone in the toilets with someone else 's girlfriend . ''
