This song finds Timberlake setting his sights on a girl and demanding she give in to her physical impulses .
It is set over producer Timbaland 's primal soundscape , which is full of tribal chants and spacious drums .
Timberlake told Rolling Stone that when he and Timbaland get in the studio , they do n't even need to speak to get their vibe going .
`` He 'll start tinkering around or I 'll start playing some chords and start tinking around with some loop of something and that 'll give him an idea and then we 'll start looping it and then I 'll start humming a melody and then we just ping-pong an idea back and forth , '' he said .
`` My relationship with Tim is very unique ; we share the same perspective that we always want to make something that reminds us of music that we love , but at the same time is something we 've never heard before . ''
