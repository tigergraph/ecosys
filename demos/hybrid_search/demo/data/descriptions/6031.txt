Little Dragon were also the supporting act in Europe , Australia , New Zealand and Hong Kong for Gorillaz on their Escape to Plastic Beach World Tour .
The title track from their third album sees Nagano meditating on the pitfalls of marriage .
`` It 's just a realistic look at love , '' she asserted to The Sun : `` I think I 'm romantic but I 'm pragmatic as well .
You get force-fed everywhere that marriage will last until old age , when in reality that is rare .
I think some people can do that I 'm not saying people should n't get married , but I think there are many sides to that coin . ''
