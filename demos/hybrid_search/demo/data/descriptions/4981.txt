The first single from British alternative rockers Gomez 's seventh album Whatever 's On Your Mind finds frontman Ian Ball singing of weighing up the options between settling down and being `` a good man '' or making `` more money for government people . ''
`` The idea came to me whilst driving past a guy shouting in the street at nothing in particular ; holding a gigantic Starbucks .
He was highly agitated by something , '' Ball told Spinner UK .
`` The only thing I caught was ` At least I 've got options . '
It started me thinking about the life choices that will confront us all sooner or later . ''
