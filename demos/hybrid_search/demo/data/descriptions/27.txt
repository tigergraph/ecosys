The origins of this song lay in a mispronounced word .
Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo explained to Spin magazine : '' ` Where 's My Sex ' - I ca n't remember now , if it was my two-year-old daughter that said it , or my wife said it , or my wife told me that my daughter said it - it was one of those three things .
One of them accidentally said ` Where 's my sex ' instead of ` Where 's my socks ' - they could n't find their socks .
And when I heard them say ` Where 's my sex , ' I just thought , ` That 's a cool song title right there , ' so I went and just started writing like crazy .
And I wrote all the lyrics .
First , I wrote it all about socks , like the song is all about trying to find your socks and how terrible it is when you 're not wearing socks .
And then I just went back and changed a few letters in the word and it became a totally different animal . ''
Cuomo described this track to the NME as `` psychotic . ''
He explained : `` I sound like a crazy person .
It 's a side of me that came out in the song . ''
