In the beginning of the song , when lead singer Fat Mike says , `` These 2 shots are for Derek ... suicide is n't painless , '' he is referring to the drummer of Lagwagon , Derek Plourde , who killed himself in 2005 .
When he mentions `` Coffee cigarettes , '' that refers to a Punk song by Lagwagon , from when Derek was in the band .
Fat Mike produced Lagwagon 's albums on a record company called Fatwreckords .
-LRB- thanks , Dylan - Tarpon Springs , FL -RRB- Where Fat Mike sings , `` and this fix is for Bradley '' he relates it directly to Bradley Nowell of Sublime , who died of a heroin overdose in 1996 .
