This song represented a piece of history for Depeche Mode .
It marked the first time that founding members Martin Gore and Dave Gahan had ever written a song together .
Gahan told The Sun : `` It was cool to do that .
Martin had this ethereal piece of music and our producer Ben Hillier pushed it . ''
The song can be found on the Deluxe edition bonus disc of Delta Machine .
Gahan told Spinner how Gore showed up in the studio with an unfinished piece he wanted to play .
`` He motioned toward me , ` What do you think ? '
and I was like , ` It 's cool , ' '' Gahan recalled .
`` Ben , who 's producing the record , said , ' I think Martin was trying to see if you 're interested in writing anything to that . ' ''
`` I just let it absorb into me for a few days , '' he added .
`` I came up with something and recorded it , and Martin seemed very happy . ''
