Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls wrote this .
She told us : `` Last Tears actually started as 2 different songs , and I put them together to become the chorus and the verse .
It 's sort of a self-affirming song for someone who 's gone through a difficult relationship , possibly a breakup , and comes to the point where it 's like , okay , we went through this , I have no regrets at all about it , but I 'm not going to cry anymore .
It 's time to move on .
So it sort of takes into account everything that happened before , and then reaching this sort of epiphany where it uses the metaphor of getting drunk on sadness .
And then when you 've reached that point of sadness , then it 's time to make the coffee , and give thanks for time that heals , and believe in moving on .
And that 's the end of the tears for that.I think that people can shift , and things can shift , and we can find perspective , and I believe that pain can be healed .
Sometimes it takes longer for others .
Just depends on the hold on your heart that someone has , and your own issues that you need to work through . ''
