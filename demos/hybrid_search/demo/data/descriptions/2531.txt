This single from Country music artist Steve Holy 's third studio album was written by Ben Glover , Joe Leathers and Rachel Thibodeau .
It was the singer 's first Top 40 hit on the Country charts since `` Men Buy the Drinks -LRB- Girls Call the Shots -RRB- '' in 2007 .
Holy discussed the song 's meaning with Nashville Music Scene : '' ` Love Do n't Run ' is basically a 3 1/2 minute explanation of why love should persevere over anything and everything .
And it 's not just limited to any one thing or person ; I think it 's a universal message .
At least that 's what I got out of it . ''
Holy was n't first choice to record the tune .
He explained to Nashville Music Scene : '' It 's kind of crazy because we went into the studio to cut four songs that we had written , and the label pitched ` Love Do n't Run ' to me .
Then it turned out , right after they gave it to me that said I could n't cut it .
They said that Ronnie Dunn has it on hold and he 's cutting it .
And for whatever reason , it ended up not working out for him and we ended up getting it . ''
Holy filmed the song 's music video at the elegant Cheekwood estate in Nashville .
He read the treatment about three days before the shoot and took a break from his tour to film it .
`` Videos are one thing that I 've never focused on .
I 've been on the road for nine straight months , non-stop , '' he told CMT News .
`` My management team said , ` This is a great story , ' and so did the label .
Watching the video , it takes a different angle , and I think it 's wonderful .
To me , it looks like a piece that should be around forever -- minus me in the video .
The actors were unbelievable .
They did all the work .
I was out there for 12 minutes . ''
