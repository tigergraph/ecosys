This is the first single from Finnish heavy metal monsters Lordi 's fifth studio album , Babez For Breakfast .
It features cover art created by Lordi mainman Mr. Lordi .
`` I wanted to paint a picture which at the same time crystallizes something of the essence that is of '80s metal and also as pays a visual tribute to many of our own idols of that era , '' commented Mr. Lordi .
`` So , to be able to fit them all in , I created a Frankenstein monster made out of bits and pieces of members of Twisted Sister , Kiss , W.A.S.P. and Alice Cooper , to name only a few.The song itself is written in the same train of thought and appreciation .
I wanted to write a song that is heavy metal according to Lordi .
The riff should sound familiar from the first second you hear it and you should be able to sing along the chorus already when it comes out the second time . ''
