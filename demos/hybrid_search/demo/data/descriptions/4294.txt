Singer Ezra Koenig 's lyrics for this song finds him asking what America 's foreign policy means for its relationship with the rest of the world .
NME asked Koenig if this song is a criticism of American foreign policy ?
He replied : `` Look , it 's not a dirty secret , anybody with a brain is critical of American foreign policy .
You can be the most patriotic American and still be deeply disturbed by it .
But ` Worship You ' , more than anything , is about really believing in something that vanishes , and then you 're left alone .
What comes next ?
That feeling transcends politics . ''
