This was originally included on the band 's self-titled 2006 debut album released on the independent Skiddco Music label .
TuneLab Music asked vocalist Jared Weeks what song from the album best represents the band .
He replied : `` To me , one of the songs on the album ` Drowning Face Down ' represents Saving Abel the best , because it kind of brings me back to the time frame when the EP album was in the creating process , and we spent endless amount of hours in the studio .
All the stress and pressure of being in the studio was starting to pile up and the song was a result of that .
I 'm really glad it turned out as well as it did .
It 's one of my favorites ! ''
