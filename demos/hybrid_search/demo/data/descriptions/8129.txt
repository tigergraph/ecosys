Dez Fafara of California heavy metal band DevilDriver and Kate Cooper of Australian indie rockers An Horse both contribute guest vocals to this track .
Cancer Bats frontman Liam Cormier told Terrorizer magazine why he brought in the two singers from opposite ends of the world .
`` That song is all about whatever walk of life you 're from , '' he explained .
`` Being in music is kind of like this unifying idea and the more I thought about it and wrote about it , you know that 's where the idea of getting Kate from An Horse to sing on it and getting the idea for Dez from Devildriver and Coal Chamber to sing on it .
All of those ideas are something that we 've all experienced and I was sitting down with Kate before we were singing a part and I was just like ` this is the idea of the song ' and she was like ` man , I 've fu -- ed up my life chasing this thing that I love to do and you 're writing exactly what I think . '
I was just like , this rules , a woman from Australia being in music has the same exact experience as me .
We 're talking about tour and it 's different shows , but it 's all the same , all the same ideas .
So that was rad.And again the idea of Dez was in my mind , so like asking him and him being so stoked , ` cos we 've toured together and we got to meet him and I was just like `` you 're the best dude '' , someone who 's still , like the idea of fighting the good fight , -LSB- he -RSB- has n't given up and just settled down , got a house , got a normal job , that dude is punk as f -- k !
Still listening to hardcore , still listening to metal , still listening to punk , something like that definitely inspires me to keep going .
So when I was writing the song obviously about different walks of life and different people , I 'm like man , the fact that Dez is still killing it and still stage diving , like who 's Dad stage dives ?
Fu -- ing Dez does ! ''
