Much of the lyrical content of Colbie Caillat 's third studio album , All Of You , concerns the ups and downs of relationships .
The theme was inspired by the Californian singer-songwriter falling in love with her guitarist and musical director Justin Young .
This song finds her singing about getting frustrated and demanding more honesty and more openness from her boyfriend .
She told PopEater : `` I write about that , and because it 's all real situations I was going through , people are gon na be able to relate to it .
It 's just what happens to everyone . ''
Struggling with the lyrics for this track , Caillat told The San Francisco Examiner she asked her friend Jason Reeves to assist her .
`` I said , ' I need to write a song , but I need help because I just ca n't express what I 'm feeling , ' '' she explained .
`` So I completely vented to him exactly what was going on , and he turned my words into poetry .
And that 's what I do now - whenever I 'm feeling it , it just comes out . ''
Caillat explained to AOL Music why she made this song the album 's title track : `` It has such a powerful meaning - which is why I named the record after it .
It 's about honesty , truth , giving all of your self to the people or person you are with .
Not hiding who you are to anyone . ''
