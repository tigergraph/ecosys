Rilo Kiley 's Jenny Lewis joins Flowers for this duet in which the Killers singer laments how hard it is to be away from his wife , Tana .
`` She 's always popped into my mind whenever I think about getting a female vocalist involved because she 's a fellow child of Las Vegas , too , '' Flowers told the NME about the collaboration with Lewis .
`` A lot of people do n't realize that , but she was actually born there , in the same hospital as -LSB- Killers drummer -RSB- Ronnie Vannucci Jr. , only a few weeks apart ! ''
