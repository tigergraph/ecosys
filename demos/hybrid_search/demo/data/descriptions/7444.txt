She Wants Revenge is an American musical post punk/electronica duo , based in San Fernando Valley , California , consisting of vocalist Justin Warfield and programmer Adam 12 '' Bravin .
The group released their third album , Valleyheart on May 23 , 2011 and this is the first single from the set .
The song 's music video was directed by Adam Bravin and served as his directorial debut .
Warfield told the story of the song in an interview with AntiMusic , where he explained that he and Adam usually start with a beat , but for this song , it was some lyric and chord ideas in his head that started the process .
Said Warfield : `` It was just a matter of getting it down and making sense of it .
For this album a lot of the lyrics were sung in the car while driving around Los Angeles with the instrumentals playing , and when inspiration would strike I 'd record the melodies into my iPhone .
I first came up with the beginning of the verse and knew what the first few lines of the song would be , next I found myself singing , ` must be the sun ' over and over , and while I knew the words were stupid and just a sketch of the rhythm and melody , it was still stuck in my head for days .
At some point I went in the studio to try and put something down , and that 's when I replaced Sun with One and the story took shape and tied into the beginning I 'd been toying with .
`` The duo then added the `` She says I do n't need anyone ... '' part , and Adam added the chord change .
Last came the bridge bassline , which Adam re-recorded after the first attempt right before he mastered the song .
