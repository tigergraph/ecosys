They also penned Selena 's single `` Naturally . ''
Selena told Billboard magazine this was selected as the second single as , `` it 's one of those tracks that 's kind of addictive because it 's kind of repetitive in the best way .
It 's one of those songs that you ca n't get out of your head . ''
The video provoked a minor controversy after pink-painted horses were filmed for the clip .
The final cut omitted the tinted animals who must have wondered why they were asked to don pink body paint for a day .
The video was directed by Geremy Jasper and Georgie Greville -LRB- Goldfrapp , Florence & The Machine -RRB- and released on June 23 , 2011 .
It takes place in a Japanese karaoke bar and features Selena finding herself transported into the videos on the karaoke 's TV set .
`` The video is the craziest video I 've ever done , '' she shared in a behind-the-scenes film about making the clip .
`` Sometimes when you 're in love , there are things you ca n't really explain and it does n't make sense .
That 's how I feel when I 'm in love . ''
