Local Natives used fake drums for this song .
Drummer Matt Frazier explained to Q magazine : `` That 's a song we 'd had for a while and tried it a bunch of ways but it did n't fit with the mood of the song .
Ryan -LSB- Hahn -RSB- came-up with these samples from these old 60s soul records and made a drum loop .
We 've never done that before , it 's always been me playing the drums . ''
Asked by Q magazine what were the moments on Hummingbird that pushed the band outside of their comfort zone , keyboardist Kelcey Ayer replied `` I think as odd as it sounds , it felt weird not to put a harmony on every part .
To have ` Three Months , ' which has no harmonies , and ` You & I , ' which , only has a subtle thing on the choruses , is weird for us .
We were trying to tell ourselves to do things more purposely , only put them on there if it sounds good - do n't just be the harmony band !
Do n't be tied down to one thing .
It 's cool you thought it was expansive .
That 's what we were definitely going for .
We did n't want to go down one ally . ''
