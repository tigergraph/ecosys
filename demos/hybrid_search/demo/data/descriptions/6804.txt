This is a track from Scottish alternative rock band Biffy Clyro 's fifth studio album , Only Revolutions .
The Only Revolutions album cover was designed by Storm Thorgerson , the creative brains behind the artwork for most of Pink Floyd 's albums including Dark Side Of The Moon .
It shows two enormous blue and red flags , each the size of an office block , on the top of a hill during a windy day .
Frontman Simon Neil explained to NME : `` Blue and red looked the most revolutionary , almost like the French flag . ''
The album title is taken from Only Revolutions , a 2006 stream of consciousness novel by American postmodern horror writer Mark Z Danielewski .
This song title is a quote from the same book .
