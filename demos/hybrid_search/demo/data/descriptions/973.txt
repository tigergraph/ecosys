Keith said of this song in publicity materials : `` I want my kids to go to OU , and I 'm tight with some of the people there .
Over the holidays somebody asked me if I went there and I said no .
They asked what school I went to and I said I graduated from the school of hard knocks .
I went to Honkytonk U .
It just sounded like a title .
I went and wrote a mini bio .
It just fell out .
I 'd written it in my head , so when I picked the guitar up and started playing it sounded like old school Waylon .
I thought , man I have n't heard anything close to this in 25 years .
I played it for my producer James Stroud and he said let 's go get some of the guys that used to record on Waylon 's albums and bring them in .
So we did . ''
