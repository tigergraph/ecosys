The title does not appear in the lyrics to this song .
As I Lay Dying lead singer Tim Lambesis told us : `` I had already written the lyrics to ` Behind Me Lies Another Fallen Solider ' when a friend of mine suggested the title .
At first I thought it was a strange suggestion , but I eventually decided to keep it because it describes the song from a different angle besides the one most obvious when reading the lyrics .
Many times in life we fight what it is God wants because we 're convinced we know what is best for ourselves .
In order to progress and change we must die to ourselves .
This battle or dying to our selfishness is not something that only happens once and for all .
There are different aspects of weakness fighting within my heart and I hope to let them all die one by one .
Selfishness , pride , lust , etc. .
The soldier left behind in that song was my pride , something this most often necessary to destroy before any of us can move on to tackle the rest of our inner demons . ''
