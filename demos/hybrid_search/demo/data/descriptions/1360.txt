Drummer Ryan Richards discussed this track in a track-by-track interview with Rock Sound magazine : `` This is probably the most ` different ' song on the record , just for the instrumentation and the vibe , which is a lot more relaxed than the rest of the album .
We wanted to write a more mellow song without making it a ballad or too light to play live - and I think we 've achieved that .
Probably the track that will surprise people most on the album .
Throwing a live drum n ' bass rhythm into a down tempo track was definitely something we 've never done before ! ''
