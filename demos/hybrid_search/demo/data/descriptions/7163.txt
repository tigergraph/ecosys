This piece of auto-tuned electro pop is the second single recorded by Barbados-based pop group Cover Drive .
The band explained to Pyro magazine why they chose this as their follow up to `` Lick Ya Down . ''
`` The song is about friends evolving into lovers , '' they said , '' ` Twilight ' is the most band-defining song we have on our upcoming album .
It made sense to go with a band-defining song after our set-up single , ` Lick Ya Down ' . ''
The song debuted at # 1 on the UK singles chart despite having nothing to do with vampires !
Cover Drive penned this tune with Swedish production team Quiz & Larossi , whose other credits include `` Up '' for The Saturdays and `` Candy '' for Aggro Santos .
Norwegian songwriter Ina Wroldsen , who has penned many of The Saturdays ' hits , is the other credited songwriter .
