Kristinia wrote this song at the age of 16 with her mentor the R&B producer and songwriter Kenny `` Babyface '' Edmonds , who is best known for his contribution to the creation of New Jack Swing in the late 1980s .
She explained to Artistdirect.com : `` We did a whole album together that we worked really hard on .
It did n't get released but we ended up keeping a few of the songs from that album and putting them on Exposed . ''
Kristinia told Artistdirect about the song 's lyrical content ; `` The song is really about falling in love for the first time .
I 'd been a relationship for over a year , and I was feeling that it had to be love .
I wanted to write a happy love song .
It became my favorite song that I ever recorded with Babyface .
I think it was because I was going through exactly everything that song was talking about .
The passion and the emotion were there .
My songs are meant to touch my fans , but if I 'm not happy with them , what 's the point ? ''
