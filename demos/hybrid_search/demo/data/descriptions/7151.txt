This was released as the second single by Jay Sean from his Neon album .
However , after it failed to make the Hot 100 , it was omitted from the final tracklisting .
The song was penned by the singer with Jared Cotter .
Former American Idol contestant Cotter also co-penned Sean 's hit tunes `` Down '' and `` Do You Remember . ''
The Dutch music producer and DJ Afrojack produced the song .
Sean told MTV News that the track came together after the artists ran into each other in the studio .
`` The Afrojack thing was great how that happened , '' Jay told MTV News .
`` He was working in the same studio that I was in when I was recording the album , and I happened to bump into him .
We recognized each other , so we checked out .
He played me a couple of his songs ; I played him a couple of my songs .
We were like , ` Yo , let 's do something together . ' ''
`` The song ` So High ' is just ridiculous .
Afrojack is such an amazing producer , '' he continued .
`` Again , he lives in the clubs .
He knows what works .
So when it comes to actually producing , he knows what 's gon na have an impact in the club . ''
