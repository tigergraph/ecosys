`` Stu '' is Ian Stewart , the Rolling Stones road manager and piano player .
The song was recorded when Led Zeppelin was set up in Headley Grange .
They were using the Rolling Stones mobile recording unit and Stu stopped in .
There was an old piano in the main room that was slightly out of tune .
Stu was playing it and Jimmy Page was tuning his guitar to how the piano was out of tune .
Tape was rolling and everything was pretty much improvised from Bonzo 's drumming to the lyrics Plant was singing .
-LRB- thanks , Joel - Bowie , VA -RRB- This was recorded in 1971 .
It was used on Physical Graffiti to fill the double album .
The lyrics were taken from the Ritchie Valens song `` Ooh My Head . ''
Since Valens was dead , his mom was given a composer credit so she would get some royalties .
That 's why `` Mrs. Valens '' is listed on the album .
The composer credit reads : Page/Plant/Jones / Bonham/Ian Stewart/Mrs .
Valens .
Stewart was considered the `` 6th Stone . ''
Stones management felt he did n't fit the image and kept him behind the scenes .
He died of a heart attack in 1985 .
Lead singer Robert Plant played guitar , while guitarist Jimmy Page played mandolin .
While `` Mrs. Valens '' has always been listed as a composer of this song , the Valens estate sued the band in 1979 over the amount of royalties they were owed .
