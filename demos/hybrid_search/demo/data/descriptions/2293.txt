The opening track of Robin Thicke 's fifth album is about the Soul crooner 's wife Paula Patton and his son , Julian .
`` My lady and I have a one-and-a-half year old now , '' Thicke told The Boombox just prior to the release of Love and War .
`` Once you see what a woman has to go through to have a baby , you really learn what real compassion and understanding and patience is all about .
That 's absolutely what inspired the whole album , because I love my wife very much and I 'm trying to learn how to do it correctly . ''
