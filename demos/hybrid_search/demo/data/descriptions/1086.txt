This song features a string quartet called the Magik Magik orchestra .
The San Francisco-based indie rock orchestra also play on the Codes and Keys title track and frontman Ben Gibbard told Q magazine he was n't concerned about falling in the pomp rock trap of needlessly using a string ensemble .
He said : `` Using orchestras and choirs for the sake of it is when it sounds really bloated .
Look at `` November Rain '' by Guns N ' Roses .
There 's no need for an orchestra to be on that song .
It does n't serve the music or make it better . ''
Codes and Keys concludes with this optimistic song , which ends with Gibbard singing , `` I 'm renewed , oh how I feel alive and through winter 's advancing/We 'll stay young go dancing . ''
The singer told Spinner UK that he chose the tune to close the album because of its sunny content .
`` We realized that virtually every record we 've ever made , with the exception of one or two , they 've had very sombre , very dark , slow , bad endings , '' he said .
`` As much as I felt really self-conscious about the sentiment of that song because it 's so light , I thought , ` Why not just put it at the end ? ' ''
The song 's music video finds a couple in their seventies reminiscing about their relationship over the decades .
`` I liked the idea of moving backwards , '' Gibbard told Spinner .
`` In the beginning you see this couple who are in their 70s , and throughout the video they move through these corridors and become younger and younger and I think it 's a rather touching way to show these two people.With all of these songs that I write , I want them to have as much universal appeal as possible and certainly do n't feel like I want to undermine the complexity of the lyrics at times and make that happen . ''
Jam !
Music asked Gibbard how much of the love content on Codes and Keys was written about his new wife , actress and musician Zooey Deschanel ?
He replied : `` There are moments on the new album - like ` Stay Young , Go Dancing ' or the first verse of ` Monday Morning ' - that are about my wife . ''
Gibbard and Deschanel split up late in 2011 after two years of marriage .
After marrying Zooey Deschanel , Gibbard moved from Seattle to Los Angeles , a city he described as `` the belly of the beast '' on 2001 's `` Why You 'd Want To Live Here . ''
Gibbard 's more cheery attitude is reflected in this song 's line , `` Life is sweet in the belly of the beast . ''
