Apple told Pitchfork why she sings about having hardened her feelings on this plea to be left alone .
She explained : `` There is a song on the new album , ` Left Alone , ' where I say , ' I do n't cry when I 'm sad anymore . '
There was a period of time when I was not feeling things .
It was terrible .
Sometimes it 's good to grow a tough hide - for press stuff , maybe .
But when I hear people say that they wo n't get a dog because they had one when they were a kid and it died , or that they do n't want to fall in love because it hurts too much , I 'm like , f -- k you . ''
Apple explained to Interview Magazine how a phrase from this song launched the creative process for The Idler Wheel .
She said : `` I think the first phrase that I wrote of for this album was at the beginning of the song ` Left Alone . '
I wanted to use the phrase ` moribund slut , ' which led me to use the phrase ` orotund mutt . ' ''
