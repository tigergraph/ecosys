This was written by the poet and children 's author Shel Silverstein , who was known for his rather dark sense of humor .
The song is about a guy who is about to be executed by hanging , and he 's counting down how much time he has before he meets his doom , starting with 25 minutes .

A year later , Cash scored big at a prison concert with another Silverstein composition : `` A Boy Named Sue . ''
