Vocalist Matt Davies-Kreye explained this track to Kerrang !
magazine September 13 , 2008 : `` When a topic strikes me , I can write so many lyrics and words on the subject .
I do n't remember what it was that I saw on the television , but whatever it was , it sparked my determination to write a song about the pain and suffering of child abuse and the ways we as a society refuse to fully acknowledge those who truly need to confide in someone so that they can begin to overcome their fears and difficult lives .
I was adamant that I would present these words as a call for understanding , and for those ears that are closed by ignorance to be opened with understanding and a determination to not let these acts of abuse continue . ''
