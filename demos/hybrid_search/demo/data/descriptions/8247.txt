This is the lead off track on the soundtrack for the third Twilight movie , Eclipse .
The song was written by electronic-laced Canadian group Metric with film composer Howard Shore -LRB- The Lord Of The Rings , The Departed -RRB- .
It was recorded in New York and at Metric 's own Giant Studios in Toronto , then mixed at Electric Lady Studios in New York and Abbey Road in London , England .
Singer/keyboardist Emily Haines wrote about the story of the song in a post on Metric 's website : `` I 've always wanted to write music for film , but I never expected to start with something on this scale , so you can imagine how surprised I was when out of nowhere I got a phone call from Howard Shore , who I 'd never met or even spoken with before .
Most people know him as the man who wrote the acclaimed score for The Lord Of The Rings trilogy , but I grew up on Shore 's earlier works -- his score for David Cronenberg 's Naked Lunch in collaboration with jazz great Ornette Coleman still stands as one of the most ambitious and unusual scores out there.To my amazement , Howard was calling to ask me to work with him on his latest project : scoring the next Twilight movie , Eclipse .
He wanted Jimmy -LSB- Shaw , guitarist -RSB- and I to write the theme song for the pivotal last scene in the movie , integrating the music from his existing score into a composition that would express the emotional ending of the film .
Seriously ?!?! The lyrics would have to be in the voice of the main character Bella , and we had to stay within the confines of harmonic and melodic themes Howard had in mind for the last scene.We 've had songs from our albums licensed for use in movies and TV shows before , but composing for a score was completely different .
Every day as the song progressed - from sitting at the piano with Jimmy in NYC recording acoustic versions and reading the script , to working at Howard 's studio upstate , to tracking vocals at our own studio Giant in Toronto , to mixing at Electric Lady with Howard on the line from Abbey Road in London -- every step of the way we did our best to fulfill Howard 's vision of the film 's last moments .
