When asked by Billboard magazine whether this song is about the band feeling `` cooler '' than they did before Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix raised their profile , vocalist Thomas Mars replied that it 's `` about the total opposite . ''
He explained : `` It 's about failing .
When you 're in a rock band , you transform yourself into a hero , a kind of god-like figure .
But the really great artists are more clever than that ... Being cool is boring . ''
Thomas Mars told the story of the song to Artist Direct : `` That one started with a very simple theme that was really light , '' he said .
`` The few lyrics attached to that song were like a collage .
All of these words were glued to that song .
They made it more complex and interesting to us .
We had a song on our first record that seemed up-tempo and fun , but the lyrics were pretty sad and there was something else to it .
In that way , those songs are pretty similar in the way we wrote them . ''
The song 's one-take music video was a collaboration with The Creators Project and was inspired by the Ramones ' punk musical Rock 'N' Roll High School .
`` There are mistakes , which is great , '' said a grinning Thomas Mars to NME of the clip , which was filmed completely live .
`` There are a couple of moments where it cuts to black . ''
Phoenix debuted the song as part of a two-track suite along with `` Drakkar Noir '' on the April 6 , 2013 edition of Saturday Night Live .
Phoenix released a remix of the song with added vocals by American R&B singer , R. Kelly .
The collaboration followed the French indie-rockers headline set at Coachella in April 2013 , which saw Kelly join them for a mash-up of his `` Ignition -LRB- Remix -RRB- '' and `` I 'm a Flirt '' with Phoenix 's `` 1901 '' and `` Chloroform . ''
