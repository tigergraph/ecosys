Khan told Mojo magazine Mojo about working with the `` Loser '' artist : `` We 'd already worked together -LRB- co-writing the song ` Let 's Get Lost ' for the soundtrack to the Twilight Saga Eclipse -RRB- and I 'd really enjoyed it .
He 's a lovely creative soul and he owns so many instruments .
He was a sounding board .
I stayed with him and his family in his beautiful -LRB- Malibu , California -RRB- house on the edge of a cliff ; we had dinner together , talked and watched films .
He 'd project old Ingmar Bergman movies silently on the walls while we were playing . ''
