This is a cover of a song which was penned by American Country music singer Keith Whitley , whose brief career in mainstream Country music lasted from 1984 until his death in 1989 .
Johnson told Billboard magazine : `` I had never heard that song before , and it turns out I do n't think Keith has ever put it out .
The only version I 've ever heard is a work tape that he did back when he wrote it .
It 's a great song . ''
