Chris Carrabba got the name for his solo career from this song : the line , `` On the way home , this car hears my confessions '' made him think of the phrase `` Dashboard Confessional . ''
He did n't want to name his new solo act after himself because he thought it might discourage fans from singing along , and fan participation is a major factor that Chris wants in his shows .
