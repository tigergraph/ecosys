Fiona 's fellow-Canadian Drake penned this song for her whilst he was working on his own sophomore release , Take Care .
They first met when they were both teenagers and Drake was an actor in DeGrassi : The Next Generation .
The pair bonded and formed a group with two others called The Renaissance , which provided entertainment at Toronto cocktail lounges and supper clubs .
Fiona told The Boombox that she loves the way Drake penned the song `` from a woman 's perspective . ''
She added : `` We all know he 's great for locking in on emotion , and I 'm great for writing and singing about it , so I think it 's a really cool concept that I think is really going to empower women .
` That Girl ' is a girl who 's done some foolish things for love , but never again . ''
