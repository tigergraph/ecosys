Little Boots , aka Victoria Hesketh , is an electro-pop singer-songwriter whose debut album , Hands , achieved chart success in her native UK in 2009 .
For the first single from her sophomore release , she teamed up with James Ford of Simian Mobile Disco .
Explained Heskith : `` The song came in the latter stages of writing the new album .
James and I had been emailing -LSB- each other -RSB- , and unusually both had a free day .
It was one of those -LSB- tracks -RSB- that just came out -LSB- of nowhere -RSB- .
Immediately it felt right .
It also shed a new light on a lot of the other songs I 'd been working on for the album . ''
Heskith said regarding the song 's lyrical content : `` I love the statement ` shake 'till your heart breaks : ' it 's that violent kind of romance that runs through some of my favourite songs . ''
