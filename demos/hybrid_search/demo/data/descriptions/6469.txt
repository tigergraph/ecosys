All ten tracks from Bon Iver are named after or describe a place or location .
This song appears to be titled after Minnesota Junction , an unincorporated community located , in the town of Oak Grove , Dodge County , which is located in eastern Wisconsin .
The band 's home state is Wisconsin , though they are based in the central western county of Eau Claire .
Bon Iver was recorded at April Base Studios , a remodeled veterinarian 's clinic in rural Fall Creek , Wisconsin .
Vernon told Q magazine why he felt the need to return home to Wisconsin to record the album .
`` I wish I could do stuff on the road and pop it into a computer , but the studio gave me the opportunity to work on sounds I was n't equipped to make anywhere else .
I needed the audio set up , keyboards , gear - because I would start the songs for this record with sounds .
I had to work backwards , in a way .
The lyrics sort of came as the melodies and songs came together .
I 'm not positive that the process was the same as For Emma - but it made sense for the voice of the songwriter to be the same . ''
The song finds Bon Iver leader Justin Vernon crooning , `` Fall is coming soon , a new year for the moon and the Hmong here . ''
The Hmong are an indigenous people of South East Asia , some of whom after emigrating to the States ended up in Eau Claire .
