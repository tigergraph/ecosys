The album title Songs in A&E appears to have been inspired by a spell in intensive care Spiritualized 's Jason Pierce experienced after a bout of double pneumonia .
However , he explained to the London Times May 16 , 2008 that this was not his original intention : `` The original idea was to write songs about a family that was n't mine ` The Waves Crash In ' is about an old man , full of pride and regret , saying goodbye to his daughter as she leaves home .
I thought if I wrote with characters in mind I could get away from myself .
But then I got out of hospital and returned to these songs and it really did sound like the whole thing had been predicted .
So the songs were about me in an odd way ; a way I had n't envisaged . ''
