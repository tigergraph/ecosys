`` Counting to 100 '' is about waiting for the person you are meant to be with : `` Never been much good on my own , so Im trying to find someone else .
Spotting you ai n't been easy , what 's a boy to do when I got this spot right beside me . ''
He 's saying that he 's been in many bad relationships and he does n't like being alone , and he knows that he needs to find someone .
`` You go hide , and I 'll come seek and maybe someday in the middle we just might meet , so I 'm counting to 100 and I promise I wo n't peek if you go hide . ''
He 's saying that he 'll be waiting for that special person and he 'll be patient and that one day they might meet somewhere .
