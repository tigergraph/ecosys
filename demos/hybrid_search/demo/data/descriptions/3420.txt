Different Gear Still Speeding was written a lot faster than any of Oasis ' albums .
Said Gem Archer to the NME : `` There 's one tune on the album , ` Three Ring Circus , ' where I finished writing the lyrics at 11 and then Liam came round at 12 to record his vocal ... so do n't say they 're the worst lyrics on the album !
Once we were up and running , it really was instant , man .
We did n't go , ` Right , we need to go away to the woods and ` write . '
It was more like , right , we 'll deal with these and then see what comes . ''
Beady Eye is in effect Oasis minus Noel .
When Spinner UK asked what made Beady Eye 's songs different to those of Oasis , Liam Gallagher replied : `` There 's a bit more room in the songs , whereas in Oasis , there was a lot going on .
We kind of steered clear of all that .
The songs can breathe a bit more .
And I 'm singing , like , early on in the process .
I 'm not waiting until the end and singing over the wall of sound .
`` Andy Bell added : `` That was one of the few things that was intentional .
We hit on that method quite early on and stuck with it .
It seemed to quite suit Liam 's voice to get it recorded as soon as possible , because then also , when you play the guitars and the instruments , you can play them around the singing , which is probably the most important part of the song .
You 're trying to communicate an emotion , so you want the voice to be communicating properly . ''
