Carlton wrote this with Stephan Jenkins , who produced her 2004 album Harmonium and co-produced Heroes & Thieves .
Irv Gotti , who also worked on the album , told Giant magazine in 2007 that the song was inspired by their relationship : Carlton was dating Jenkins , who is also the lead singer of Third Eye Blind .
In the Song Vanessa refers to `` oceans five fathoms deep . ''
Since a fathom is only 6 feet , 5 of them would make the oceans she mentions 30 feet deep - a bit shallow by most estimations .
