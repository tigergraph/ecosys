The song title is taken from a 1980 book by Alvin Toffler .
The tome describes the transition in developed countries from Industrial Age society , which Toffler calls the `` Second Wave '' to Information Age `` Third Wave '' society .
Vocalist Burton C. Bell explained : `` The term was taken from the book The Third Wave .
It explains the path in which the industrial complex , and its construct , initiated the path of conformity .
Everyone worked for the benefit of the machine , not for themselves .
The discipline begins in mass education , determining time and placement , superiors and subordinates , rank and file .
Humanity has been disciplined to do the work for the machine , therefore becoming the machine . ''
