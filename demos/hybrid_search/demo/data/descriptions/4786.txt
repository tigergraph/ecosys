Drummer Barry Kerch told Alternative Addiction the story behind this tale of someone coming apart : `` This is about a guy that used to work with us and we really looked up to him but he changed ; changed who he was , changed his whole outlook on life .
We respected him and then he had a midlife crisis at the drop of a dime and became a different person and we had to let him go . ''
