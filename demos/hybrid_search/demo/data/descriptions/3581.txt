On this mellow track Eminem compares his hip-hop career to torn relationships , detailing how his devotion to music and the resulting fame has affected his ability to relate to women .
Eminem explained this song 's meaning to Vibe magazine : `` What the whole song is saying is that I have a strange relationship with hip-hop because I love it so much .
I go through this thing in my head a lot , which I 'm sure every rapper does , where you give your life to this thing .
You literally give everything that you got .
I come to work some days wearing the same thing two days in a row -- baggy sweats -- just dedicating my life to this .
And there are times that I feel like I get the respect that I deserve and there are times where I feel like I do n't . ''
The song was produced by DJ Khalil and features the vocals of Liz Rodrigues , who is a member of the producer 's group .
The Toronto-based singer also appears on the Recovery track , `` Almost Famous . ''
