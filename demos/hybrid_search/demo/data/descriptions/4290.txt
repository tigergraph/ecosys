This song is about a man who accidentally comes upon fame and marries a greedy woman seeking it herself .
As the years wear on , the man grows tired of fame and becomes an alcoholic .
He finds himself reaching for help from her but she is only concerned with herself , so he shoots himself with a shotgun .
For the rest of the widow 's life , she rides on the coattales of her late husband for fame and fortune , crying shamelessly in public .
This tale is very similar to the life of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love , but nobody knows if this was intentional .
