Basement Jaxx are an UK house dance/electronic duo consisting of Felix Buxton and Simon Ratcliffe .
This is a track from their 5th studio album , Scars .
This tribute to human resilience features John Lennon 's widow Yoko Ono 's childlike vocals and trademark wails .
Buxton met the Japanese-American artist and musician after hearing that she was a Basement Jaxx fan .
He admitted to The Daily Mirror April 24 , 2009 : `` I actually did n't know her stuff that well .
But when I went and heard it , I found she was really ahead of her time .
When we met she was very cool , 76 but jumping around , much more out there than people in their twenties .
I did a whole load of stream of consciousness writing I gave to her and she read it like a poem , which was wicked .
I also asked her questions for an interview , which we might use later , asking her stuff about life , death and everything else .
`` After their initial conversation they agreed to go into the studio and lay down a track .
Ratcliffe recalled to The London Times September 18 , 2009 : `` She was a bit wary of going into a studio with a bunch of DJ-producers but she was great to work with , really youthful and on it .
She said : ` Shall I do my Yoko Ono thing ? '
and we said : ` Absolutely ! ' ''
