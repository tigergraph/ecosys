This song finds Jennifer Nettles encouraging a struggling young woman who is trying to handle everything all by herself .
Said her musical partner Kristian Bush : `` I saw my mom as that person .
I see pieces of it in my own daughter .
Jennifer is certainly one of those women . ''
The song is one of The Incredible Machine 's earliest penned tracks .
`` We were at a festival over a year ago and I was on the bus doing my makeup while Kristian was warming up , '' recalled Nettles in publicity materials .
`` I was wearing a checkered dress and he started playing this lick and singing , ` Little Miss checkered dress . '
I popped my head out and sang , ` Little Miss one big mess ! '
The way that song was discovered was fun and really beautiful . ''
