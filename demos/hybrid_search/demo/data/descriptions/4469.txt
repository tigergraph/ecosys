Gloriana 's Tom Gossin penned this song along with the trio 's producer Matt Serletic -LRB- who has also worked with Matchbox Twenty -RRB- , and with the Nashville songwriter Tommy Lee James .
The song was inspired by the band 's early days when they first met with Serletic before he signed them to his Emblem Music Group .
Gossin explained to Billboard magazine : `` Back when Gloriana started , Matt Serletic called us after hearing our demo and asked us to fly to L.A. to meet with him .
I started to think about how some people are always trying to track down fame in Hollywood .
I thought about how the last time people were in such a hurry to get to California was during the Gold Rush in the 1800s .
You could go out there , strike gold , and get rich overnight .
In the song I 'm drawing a parallel between the two .
Back then , it was about physical gold , whereas the gold of today is the allure of fame .
It plays into a recurring theme on the record : All the things you had back home will always be more important than the illusion of fame . ''
