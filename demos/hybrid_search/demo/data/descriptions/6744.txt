Kimbra is telling a guy on this song that she does n't want to be his `` posse girl , '' as she prefers to maintain her standards rather than conforming into what is believed to be `` cool . ''
The New Zealand songstress told American Songwriter magazine that she is especially proud of the lyric , `` It 's not you , maybe I 'm just too pedantic , I 'm a self-confessed idealist , and romantic . ''
She explained : `` It feels like one of the more honest moments on the record .
Exposing your flaws through a song can be scary but also kind of liberating . ''
