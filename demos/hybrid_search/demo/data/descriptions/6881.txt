This song is about Everything Everything 's distrust of the showbiz side of the music industry .
As a band signed to a major label they feel discomforted by some of the things they 've witnessed .
Guitarist Alex Robertshaw explained to The Line Of Best Fit : `` You 're interested in it and , at the same time , you 're confused by it .
All these things ... you want to see them but you do n't necessarily want to be part of them .
`` Frontman Jonathan Higgs added : `` It sort of reads like a diatribe , it 's a rant really , is n't it .
It 's a kind of attack on the X Factor world , really .
It starts off talking about how you can be false and play the sob story and you can get what you want .
Well done , now you 're singing cover versions .
But then it goes through the hangers-on and the yes men .
It 's a reaction against the darker side of the business we 're in , what we 've seen since becoming a band . ''
