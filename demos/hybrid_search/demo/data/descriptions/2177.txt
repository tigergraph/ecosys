Demi penned this synth anthem with Ryan Tedder and Noel Zancanella .
The pair , who previously worked with the singer on her 2011 Unbroken track `` Who 's That Boy ? ''
also produced the tune .
Tedder revealed that the idea to produce the song was his own .
He stated : `` That record we did intentionally because I wanted to ... I heard it on her demo-reel and the next day I woke up and the melody was in my head , and I could n't get it out of my head for two days , that 's when I knew . ''
The song inspired the name of Lovato 's Neon Lights Tour .
Speaking about Lovato 's vocals on the song , Tedder told the UK station Capital FM : `` She came in and just ripped it .
She , in pop music has one of the biggest ranges , possibly the highest full voice singer I 've ever worked with . ''
`` She can belt full voice like three octaves above middle C , it 's just crazy , '' Tedder added , `` and with complete power and complete control .
At the beginning she 's singing the lowest note she 's ever done , and by the end she 's going as high as she 's ever gone . ''
The Ryan Pallotta-directed video finds Lovato taking a dip in a purple pool of water before she hits the dance floor at an underground rave .
As she starts dancing along , the lights go out to show the singer literally glowing , thanks to some neon makeup .
