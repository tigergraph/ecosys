The hypnotic closer on Bowie 's Black Tie White Noise album was first composed as a floating instrumental to be played at his wedding to Iman in 1992 , one of five songs that he wrote for the nuptials .
Bowie later added lyrics , transforming the tune into a declaration of euphoria from a man intent on changing his errant ways .
The album opens with `` The Wedding , '' which was the original instrumental version .
