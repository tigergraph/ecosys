The original Tennis duo of Alaina Moore and Patrick Riley decided to expand their core surf pop sound for their sophomore album , Young & Old , by adding drummer James Barone to the band full-time and enlisting Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney to produce the set.This was the first song written for the record .
Moore found inspiration for it in a poem by William Butler Yeats , A Woman Young and Old in which a woman reflects on a lifetime 's worth of memories .
After hearing Riley 's music for the song , she began to think of personal issues involved in being in a band such as dealing with critics and relationships .
`` I thought about how the suddenness of becoming a band and spending so much time on the road with others seemed to bring out the best and the worst in me .
I thought a lot about human nature -- mine , really , and the way it had been portrayed to me in my childhood , '' she told Rolling Stone .
`` I felt frustrated with the self-defeating conception of humanity I was presented with . ''
`` I would n't have written a line of -LSB- `` Origins '' -RSB- if it had n't been for Yeats , '' Moore added .
