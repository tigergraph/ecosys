Cassiopeia was a Greek mythological queen known for her vanity .
Through boasting of her beauty , she was sent to the heavens as a constellation , the chief stars of which form the outline of a woman sitting in a chair and holding up both arms as if in supplication .
During the making of The Blessed Unrest , Sara Bareilles was given a book about astronomy .
She found herself fascinated reading about the different constellations , especially Cassiopeia , as well as the topic of supernovas , the incredibly bright bursts of light that stars give off when they explode .
Inspired , she penned this song imagining Cassiopeia as a human , and falling in love with another star .
`` I started to think about how that might feel to personify , you know ?
The idea of being a star and so far away from everything around you , '' she told Radio.com `` What if a star falls in love ?
The song is this idea that you give something up to come together . ''
`` When stars collide they explode , '' Bareilles continued .
`` So it 's that sort of idea that you give something up to come together .
But it 's worth it in the end . ''
Singer-songwriter Joanna Newsom originally named a song after Cassiopeia on her independent label debut album The Milk-Eyed Mender , released on March 23 , 2004 .
Bruce Springsteen also mentions the constellation in his Devils and Dust track , `` Long Time Coming . ''
