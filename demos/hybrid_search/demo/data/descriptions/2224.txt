The closing track of Jeff Bridges ' self-titled album was one of three songs written for the project by his friend John Goodwin , who the Crazy Heart actor has known since the fourth grade .
They previously worked together on Bridges ' first record , Be Here Soon , which was released in 2000 .
During an interview with The Boot , Bridges was asked what he feels his quest is ?
He replied : `` I guess my personal quest is waking up .
Waking up to all sorts of stuff , -LSB- to -RSB- see that we 're all so connected more than we think we are .
And to wake up to that fact and then start behaving that way .
`` Bridges added : '' ` Behaving that way ' means taking care of each other .
We 're travelers on this little , tiny dust speck thrown out into space , and we got to get together and make this place work .
It 's as simple as that . ''
