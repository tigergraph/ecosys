Vocalist Josh Franceschi told Virgin.com this is his favorite vocal on the album .
He explained : `` My favourite vocal on the album is in a song called ` Contagious Chemistry ' where I think it 's got enough aggression , 'cause it 's quite an aggressive song , it 's got enough aggression in my voice to really suggest that that 's where it 's coming from , and at the same time it 's got like really nice delicate parts in it as well .
So I 'm really happy with that song , it 's really good . ''
