This song is written from the perspective of a frustrated wife who turns to drinking after her cheating , no good , alcoholic husband leaves her .
Fortunately , it 's pure fiction : Holly married her drummer , Chris Coleman , in 2009 , and while marital bliss is subjective , it 's clear from Holly 's lifestyle blog that when she wrote this song , she was more likely to make a pâté than to go on a bender.Holly , however , is the granddaughter of Hank Williams , perhaps the greatest storyteller in the history of Country music .
She tells us that this is an example of his influence : `` That 's always been very natural to me to write a really simple song , with repetitive verses and a story .
` Drinkin '' is more in the Hank Sr. style of writing . ''

Unlike many Nashville songwriters , Holly does n't write by appointment , as she ca n't coax the inspiration .
She finds that the songs come to her at random times , and this one appeared while she was driving at night .
`` A lot of times I 'm driving in my car at night , and if I 'm on the road , it 's total quiet and there 's not Internet and computers , '' she explained .
`` That came out of nowhere .
That was one of those 10 minute songs that just fell out .
And I love the melody of it .
It 's a really fun song to play . ''
