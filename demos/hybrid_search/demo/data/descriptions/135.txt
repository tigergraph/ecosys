Another hit for the former deposed Miss America , who made lemonade out of lemon -LRB- in the form of scandal -RRB- by scoring success as both a singer and actress .
This song is about a marriage which is sometimes turbulent , but ultimately worthwhile , with the `` good old days '' currently happening .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA -RRB-
