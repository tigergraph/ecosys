This song penned by Muse singer/guitarist/keyboardist Matthew Bellamy , bassist Chris Wolstenholme and drummer Dom Howard is the lead single for the soundtrack of the third Twilight movie , Eclipse .
In this song , Bellamy reflects on the true power of love .
He explained on BBC Radio 1 that it was written after he broke-up with his long-term girlfriend at the end of 2009 , and was based on his feelings at the beginning of their relationship .
Wolstenholme discussed with the BBC the confusion surrounding how this track would appear in Eclipse : `` When we were in the studio writing it , one minute they said they wanted to use it in the end credits , then they said they wanted to use it in another scene .
Then it was another scene and in the end we were like , ` Do what you want with it , we do n't care any more . ' ''
Muse are said to be Twilight author Stephanie Meyers ' favorite band , and the English three-piece previously contributed their song `` Supermassive Black Hole '' to the soundtrack of Twilight , and a remix of `` I Belong To You '' appeared on the New Moon soundtrack in 2009 .
In an interview with the BBC , Wolstenholme said he was ambivalent about the band 's music being a part of the Twilight soundtrack .
He said : `` I 'm not sure how cool it is to be on those kind of things but sometimes you 've just got to get your music out there in different ways .
It 's very difficult in America because you do n't have anything like Radio 1 , nothing is national .
You have to take every opportunity you get over there and sometimes you have to sell your soul . ''
