This is about then-Governor of California Jerry Brown , and is sung from his perspective .
In the song , an imaginary President Brown outlines his Hippie/Zen Fascist vision of America .
In 1984 , the Dead Kennedys re-released this song on their album In God We Trust , Inc. , which is about then-president Ronald Reagan .
It was re-titled , `` We 've Got A Bigger Problem Now . ''
-LRB- thanks , Zach - Central , NJ -RRB- This looks like a good place to mention somebody else who had a dark view of California : Al Kooper in Backstage Passes and Backstabbing Bastards says , `` The New York sensibility has always regarded California with suspicion .
If your system is geared to New York 's nonstop adrenaline rush , the relaxed California life-style can seem as if you 're playing a 45 RPM record at 33 -LRB- 1/3 -RRB- .
Usually , if New Yorkers follow that slow a pace , they move to Florida . ''
Kooper also relates the experience of staying at a friend 's house which was actually a disgusting bug-ridden crash pad , and visiting another friend who , although rich , was too stoned to notice that he was eating dog food .
Together , these experiences gave him an impression that California is depressing .
