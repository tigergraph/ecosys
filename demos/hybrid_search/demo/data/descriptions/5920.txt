Waits signs off the Deluxe edition of Bad as Me with this imagination of what 's it like to die .
During an interview with UK newspaper The Observer he was asked if this is the kind of thing that keeps him awake at nights ?
`` Well , I guess , '' Waits replied .
`` But that song started out just as a riff , taking triple rhymes , batting them back and forth .
` Like a jail door closing , like a male whore dozing ... ' And so on . ''
