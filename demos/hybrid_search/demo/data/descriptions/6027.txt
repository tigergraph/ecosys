This is a track from North England indie rock band Detroit Social Club 's debut album , Existence .
Singer David Burn told The Sun newspaper May 21 , 2010 this is `` about a friend of mine who has loads of potential but lives in a shell . ''
The orchestral version of the track has featured regularly on the bedding music for Sky Sports ' Premier League and Champions League football coverage during the 2010-11 season .
Burn told NME the channel 's interest in the track is a huge bonus .
`` As a band your main objective is to get your music heard by as many people as possible particularly when radio play for new bands is being pretty much strangled these days , '' he said .
`` It 's also nice to know that a melody that started in my head one morning when I woke up is being heard by millions of people . ''
The album title , Existence was inspired by two favorite books of the singer : Any Human Heart by William Boyd and Notes From the Underground by Dostoyevsky .
Burn told The Sun : `` I 'm just fascinated in the differences between one human being and another and what shapes them . ''
