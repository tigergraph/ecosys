Teenage dance-pop singer and actor Jacob Latimore grew up around music - his father and uncles make up the inspirational quartet , The Latimore Brothers .
By 2005 , the 9-year-old Jacob had made up in his mind that he wanted to pursue a career in music .
With the support and help from his parents , he teamed up with local Milwaukee producers who put together his first song , `` Best Friend , '' which got picked up by Radio Disney .
Jacob was featured on the station 's Incubator program , which profiles promising young artists around the country.In 2007 , Jacob 's parents and management agreed that in order to take Jacob 's career to the next level , it would be ideal to move him to Atlanta .
In his new location , Jacob continued to make even more noise as his single , `` Superstar , '' produced by the Corna Boys and Rico Love charted on the Billboard R&B and Hip Hop Sales Charts with little to no promotion.By 2010 Jacob was pursuing a parallel career as an actor .
After several commercials , voice-overs , and TV episodes he got booked for his first lead role in the post-apocalyptic feature film , Vanishing Street .
Jacob explained the concept behind the Mickey Finnegan directed video to AOL Music : `` My team and I wanted to do a treatment that would showcase me as a dancer .
We thought Mickey Finnegan 's treatment would showcase that the best .
The video is about me meeting my alter ego who wants to battle me and my crew . ''
This Harmony-produced track was made available on iTunes starting June 21 , 2011 .
Jacob explained the song 's meaning to AOL Music : `` The lyrics in my new song are about me being a better dancer than my competitor .
But the real meaning behind the song is about being confident in yourself and believing that you can do whatever you set your mind to do no matter what anyone tells you .
We all have non believers and now we can tell them you ai n't got ` Nothing on Me . ' ''
