This is one of a pair of tracks that Plant recorded for Band of Joy , which he took from Duluth , Minnesota downbeat indie rock band Low 's 2005 album , The Great Destroyer .
Plant told Mojo : `` I had to try and make it more creepy-crawl than them .
It could be This Mortal Coil 's kid sister , a 4AD release from 1991 . ''
