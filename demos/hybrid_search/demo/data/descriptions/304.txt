The song starts off with a solemn , piano-driven introduction before eventually bringing vocalist Ben Gibbard into full view .
It blossoms into a full-blown paean to unobstructed adoration for a lover with Gibbard repeating , `` Just our love / Just our love . ''
It is not known if the singer wrote the tune before or after he married the actress and She & Him songstress Zooey Deschanel in September 2009 .
Gibbard described this to Spin magazine as , `` a sprawling , seven-minute track that 's mostly instrumental .
It has the piano and keyboard soundscapes that I 've been really enjoying . ''
