This upbeat dance track is from Whitney Houston 's seventh album , I Look to You .
The song was written by Claude Kelly -LRB- `` My Life Would Suck Without You '' , `` Circus . '' -RRB-
and Timbaland engineer Marcella Araica .
Timbaland associate Nathaniel `` Danja '' Hills produced the track .
Danja told Billboard magazine he first heard this song before executive producers Larry Jackson and Clive Davis gave it to him to produce .
`` I always liked it , '' Danja said , `` It made me feel like the ` Africa ' song -LSB- by Toto -RSB- . ''
At some point during production , it became clear this tune was meant for Houston .
Danja said , `` When we finally got to the zone we started to design it for her . ''
He continued , `` We did it in a day .
It was a spur-of-the-moment type of thing .
We had this record .
Everybody loved it but it just could be taken to another level .
It just needed something in the chorus , something to build . ''
That 's when Danja stepped in .
On this dance cut Houston declares this song is for everyone who believes in love .
