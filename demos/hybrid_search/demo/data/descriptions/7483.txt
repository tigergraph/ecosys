This song clocks in at eight minutes , making it Springsteen 's longest studio song since The River 's `` Drive All Night '' back in 1980 .
Springsteen explained to the Observer Music Monthly January 2009 about this fable concerning a character who ca n't escape his past : `` The past is never the past .
It is always present .
And you better reckon with it in your life and in your daily experience , or it will get you .
It will get you really bad .
It will come and it will devour you , it will remove you from the present .
It will steal your future and this happens every day.We 've lived through a nightmare like that in the past eight years here .
We had a historically blind administration who did n't take consideration of the past ; thousands and thousands of people died , lives were ruined and terrible , terrible things occurred because , there was no sense of history , no sense that the past is living and real.So the song is about this happening to this character .
He moves ahead .
He tries to make the right moves .
He awakes from a vision of his death , and realizes : life is finite .
Time is with me always .
And I 'm frightened .
And he rides west where he settles down .
But the past comes back in the form of this bounty hunter , whose mind is also quickened and burdened by the need to get his man .
And these possessed creatures meet along the shores of this river where the bounty hunter of course is killed , and his last words are : ` We ca n't undo the things we 've done .
` In other words , your past is your past .
You carry it with you always .
These are your sins .
You carry them with you always .
You better learn how to live with them , learn the story that they 're telling you .
Because they 're whispering your future in your ear , and if you do n't listen , it will be contaminated by the toxicity of your past . ''
