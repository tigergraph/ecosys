This is the first single from the eighth studio album by the metal band Soulfly , which has a concept running through it of slavery .
The collection was recorded in late 2011 in Tallcat Studios in Phoenix , Arizona and produced by frontman Max Cavalera along with Chris `` Zeuss '' Harris .
It is the first Soulfly record to feature Asesino frontman Tony Campos on bass , and former Borknagar drummer David Kinkade on drums .
This single was released on January 25 , 2012 .
Singer Travis Ryan of San Diego extreme metallers Cattle Decapitation recorded guest vocals for this song at Frick ` in Studios in San Marcos , California .
He was a replacement for Soulfly 's original choice , Oceano 's Adam Warren .
Commented Ryan : `` It 's an honor to receive a call from someone you had pictures of on your wall as a kid asking you to be on a new album of theirs .
I literally had a picture of Max and Gloria -LSB- Max 's wife and manager -RSB- holding -LSB- Gloria 's son -RSB- Richie in her arms that I ripped out of a copy of Metal Maniacs on my wall when I was 15 or 16 .
Now they 're asking for my artistic hand in one of their creations ; -LSB- it -RSB- just does n't get much more surreal than that .
Very honored and the song is very ` death metal-ish ' and completely crushes .
Happy to be a part of it ! ''
