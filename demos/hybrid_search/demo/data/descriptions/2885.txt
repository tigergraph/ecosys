Anyone for Tennis ?
No , not the racket sport , after all this is a music site .
Tennis is a Colorado-based duo comprising Patrick Riley and Alaina Moore who formed after a perilous sailboat journey on the Atlantic Ocean .
Their three-month trip inspired the pair to write Cape Dory about their time on the seas , the majority of the tracks being about the difficulties they experienced during their trip .
This song documents the couple 's first departure from the dock .
Riley told Spinner : `` We almost ran into a bridge and on the way we totally thought we were going to lose the boat like five times .
Then like a gale came in out of the west and we were stuck in the anchorage for two whole days .
The winds were like 40 knots and we 'd never experienced anything like that before , so were scared s -- less . ''
So , why ` Tennis ' ?
Riley explained to Spinner : `` Honestly , it 's just a joke .
It really seems like everything we 're doing looks really WASPy , really Anglo .
I drink scotch a lot and wear loafers .
I 've been wearing my grandpa 's shoes for the last 10 or 20 years , and we studied philosophy and I did play tennis at one point and we sail .
We 're like the WASPiest people and we 're really white , too .
I have blonde hair .
It could n't be worse . ''
