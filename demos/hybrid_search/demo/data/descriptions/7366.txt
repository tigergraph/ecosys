Singer-songwriter Charlie Brown worked his apprenticeship in the music business co-penning songs for the likes of The Script , Jay Sean and Wiley .
After signing to AATW in July 2012 , Brown started working on his debut album .
He told Digital Spy that solo stardom was always his main goal .
`` Every time I did a writing session with someone I 'd keep a couple of songs back that I knew would be good for me , '' he said .
`` It kept nagging me at the back of my mind .
That said , I 've seen it not happen for a lot of people , so I feel like I 've been realistic and have tried as hard as I can .
The rest is up to the universe to decide ! ''
This is Brown 's debut single , which he originally penned in 2010 after firing his then manager .
`` I was looking for a tune on my iPod that I could put on to inspire me and lift my mood , '' he said , `` but there was n't one . ''
So Brown decided to write his own uplifting track .
