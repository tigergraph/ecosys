American Hip-Hop trio Beastie Boys succeeded in making some noise with this first single from their eighth studio album , Hot Sauce Committee , Pt .
2 .
After the song was leaked online prematurely , the band responded by putting it on their website too .
Mike D wrote on the band 's blog : `` This was n't really part of the plan , but since this track is out there we wanted to let you hear it here first , or maybe second .
Enjoy . ''
The song 's music video is taken from the Beastie 's short film , Fight For Your Right Revisited , a 30-minute retelling of the events that followed the famous `` Fight For Your Right to Party '' clip .
Amongst the well-known faces you might recognise in the star-studded visual are Will Ferrell , Elijah Wood , Steve Buscemi , Ted Danson , Seth Rogan and Jack Black .
The track finds the trio spitting rhymes about parties on the left and right over brash instrumentation including some cowbell .
The whole package is reminiscent of the Beasties ' '80s material such as their anthem `` Fight For Your Right To Party . ''
