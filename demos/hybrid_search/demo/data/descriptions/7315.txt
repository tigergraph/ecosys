Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody struggled with writer 's block when penning Fallen Empires .
Speaking to Q magazine , the singer explained how a chance meeting with R.E.M. vocalist Michael Stipe at a Californian studio rejuvenated his writing process .
He recalled , `` I could n't even write my name on a cheque .
It was that bad at the time ... -LRB- Stipe arriving at the studio -RRB- was amazing because the first song I ever played live was R.E.M. 's ` Find the River ' at a school concert .
`` Although Stipe 's input was minimal , it was enough to inspire Lightbody to rediscover his muse .
He recalled , `` Michael just made a few suggestions here and there .
On a track called ` New York ' there was a line , ` Your face has never left me . '
He said , ` That sounds like you 've got a girl 's head in your bag . '
So we changed that . ''
Lightbody penned this song with Snow Patrol pianist Johnny McDaid in his London studio .
Lightbody explained the story behind this piano ballad : `` I always try to write about personal experiences - ` New York ' is about a girl I was seeing over there .
We both had strong feelings for one another , but we were never in the same place at the same time .
It 's about missed opportunities . ''
Canadian musician Owen Pallett , who has also worked with Arcade Fire and Duran Duran did the song 's orchestral arrangement .
Lightbody told Billboard magazine : `` We were having so much trouble with it trying to get the arrangement but he came in and saved our asses . ''
