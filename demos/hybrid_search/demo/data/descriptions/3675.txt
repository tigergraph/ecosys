This love anthem is the first single from British alternative rock band Echo & The Bunnymen .
's eleventh studio album , The Fountain .
The Fountain was helmed by Scottish producer John McLaughlin , whose credits include work with pop groups Busted and Five .
McCulloch explained why he hooked up with somebody with such an `` uncool '' resume : `` He said the Bunnymen were his favourite thing of all time , but really I think its The Clash and Bruce Springsteen .
I just became really good friends with him .
I really want a big , solid undertow beneath the lyrics , not all jingly jangly like Siberia .
I wanted someone I could trust to get the sound when he heard me playing ` The Idolness Of Gods ' with just guitar , it made him cry .
He gets why I write the way I do .
There 's glory in it .
Certain lyrics make you go , Bloody hell .
Its the atmosphere I can evoke with the way I sing and write melody . ''
This was one of the first songs written for The Fountain back in 2007 .
Frontman Ian McCulloch explained in publicity materials : `` I thought -LSB- guitarist , Will Sergeant and I -RSB- needed to do stuff differently , but so the result still sounded like the Bunnymen .
What we got with Think I Need It Too and Forgotten Fields , I thought , Yeah , this is how it should sound . ''
