Lead singer Sonny Sandoval : `` Musically , this song is just so heavy .
And the lyrical flow is straight , Southern hip-hop .
But the lyrics themselves are really straightforward .
C.S. Lewis 's The Lion , The Witch , And The Wardrobe inspired them .
There are so many different , biblical and Godly references in that book .
We wanted this song to be last , because it closes it all up . ''
