Texan Country artist Sunny Sweeney 's second single from her sophomore album tells the story of a relationship at its end .
The narrator knows it 's time to call it quits , but the thought of goodbye has whipped her into a tailspin : `` Leaving 's hard / Trust me it 's really bad . ''
However , the pain of staying overwhelms the fears of walking away as she acknowledges that , `` Even though this freedom feels a lot like treason/I know staying 's worse than leaving . ''
Sweeney told Billboard magazine the song is about her divorce .
She said : `` I had a marriage that dissolved over the course of the last couple of years and it 's really hard .
When I sing that song , people come up to me and tell me their stories , saying , ` Girl , your song gave me the strength to leave , ' or , ` Your song made me want to work it out . '
I can not believe that a song that is going to be on my record can affect people like that .
It 's pretty flattering . ''
Sweeney co-wrote this tune with the singer-songwriter Radney Foster , who has also penned songs for the likes of Dixie Chicks , Kenny Chesney , Keith Urban and Brooks and Dunn .
The other co-writer was Jay Clementi , whose previous collaborations with Foster include Darius Rucker 's track , `` Might Get Lucky . ''
Their partnership goes back to 2002 when the veteran hitmaker produced an album that Clementi recorded with his father .
Sweeney explained the significance of the album title to The Boot : `` I do n't really like self-titled records , because it 's not very original .
Using one of the songs as the title track is a little iffy , because it does n't really encompass the whole record .
I wanted one word , tough and solid .
My opinions on music are concrete , the lyrics are heavy like concrete and the melodies are solid like concrete . ''
