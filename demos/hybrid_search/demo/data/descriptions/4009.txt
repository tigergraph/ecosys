This surging anthem finds lead singer Julian Casablancas expressing a few thoughts about his love life and going out .
He told the NME : `` The line ` Monday/Tuesday is my weekend . '
I originally wanted to say ` Sunday/Monday/Tuesday ' but it did n't fit .
Those were always my favourite nights to go out .
I 'm not into going out on Friday or Saturday , never have been .
I like empty-ish bars . ''
This was released as the second single from Angles .
It features a B-side duet version of the song with Elvis Costello , which was recorded after the British singer-songwriter performed the song onstage with the band earlier at Madison Square Garden after appearing as their unlikely support act .
