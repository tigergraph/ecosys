Casting Crowns frontman and principal songwriter Mark Hall admonishes the church to show compassion in this song .
He explained to NewReleaseTuesday : `` I 've often said that the world does n't know enough about what believers stand for , and too many times they only know what we 're against .
This song is a reminder that we all need to do something about that.While the song uses strong words to grab our attention , the truths are meant to lead us to the prayer within the chorus : Lord , open our eyes to the world at the end of our pointing fingers and let our hearts be led by mercy .
If we 're to do nothing else , it 's to do justly , love mercy , and to walk humbly before our God . ''
-LRB- Micah 6:8 -RRB- .
Hall admitted to New Release Today that when he , `` first read the lyrics to my wife , Melanie , she gave me that cocked eyebrow look , '' and asked if he was `` sure you can say that ? ''
He explained why he felt the need to write such a plain-spoken song : `` While it 's true this is one of the more direct songs we 've written , it also speaks truth .
And I think believers should speak truth to each other as long as we do it in love .
The people who worship with us know we love them .
We are n't some angry artist standing outside and criticizing the church .
We 're in it right alongside other believers , and we 're also preaching to ourselves first .
In fact , you 'll notice in the first verse that I 'm speaking about myself : ` The world is on their way to you , but they 're tripping over me ; always looking around , but never looking up ; I 'm so double-minded . '
I think God has given us a platform where we can talk honestly about issues important to his heart .
That 's why the cry of this song is , ` God , break our hearts for what breaks yours . ' ''
