Guitarist Mike Einziger wrote this song when he was at university before developing it with vocalist Brandon Boyd for Incubus 's If Not Now , When album .
He told Rock Sound magazine : `` The song was written a while ago when I was at university .
Brandon originally did n't like the song , but I developed it over a couple of years , and when I played it to him again he did n't recognize it as being the same song .
But the essence is definitely there .
As soon as the rhythm was developed , the lyrics and melodies came really quickly to Brandon , and it was something we were all excited about . ''
Lyrically , the song is about the strength of love despite the confines of the 21st century understanding of it .
Boyd explained on the band 's official website : '' ` Friends and Lovers ' is a song that I always hoped we would write .
I do believe it is my most favorite thus far .
It speaks to the heart of many of our culturally held biases about relationships and what love looks like .
It combats the long held notions of love and intimacy and plainly states that Friends make the best Lovers .
And that love can in fact be born of friendship and can indeed last outside of our pre-prescribed notions of what it looks like , feels like and how it endures .
Movies and religion have largely defined our cultural notions of this most important of topics .
And in this song it was my attempt to share a different idea of what modern love might look like . ''
