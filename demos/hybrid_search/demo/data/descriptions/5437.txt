Grand Duchy are a duo comprising one-time Pixies singer Frank Black -LRB- born Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV -RRB- and his wife Violet Clark .
Petit Fours are exotic little cakes , which can be found more readily in Europe than in the States .
Clark told The Sun : `` I 've got a sweet tooth and have been sort of obsessed with them my whole life .
They 're colourful , sweet ; they have layers and come in many flavors .
There 's symbolism in there somewhere . ''
This song , in which the couple trade verses , was the first song , which they did together .
Clark told to The Sun February 20 , 2009 about its recording : `` A magical day in the studio .
A beautiful game of tag .
Beginning with one verse of Charles ' acoustic guitar strumming away , we each took turns watching our little ones while the other added bits .
At the end of one day , we had a finished track . ''
