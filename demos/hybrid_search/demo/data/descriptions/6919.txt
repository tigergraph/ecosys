Loaded with metaphors , this song is about life , plain and simple .
Gretchen Peters wrote it about a time when the city of Nashville , Tennessee , was experiencing a `` funny growing pains kind of stage . ''
Not unlike a person .
`` It 's got a thread of sadness that goes through it a little bit , '' says Peters .
`` But it 's upbeat .
It really actually came about because I had moved to downtown Nashville and I started thinking about the downtown .
And there were n't a lot of groups back downtown , so there was this kind of emptiness there still .
And I had moved downtown and I was feeling so great about it .
But the town , it was a little bit sad and it 's a little bit happy .
I thought it would make a great metaphor for a person , the verse about ` there 's a hole in the middle where nobody goes . '
It was a happy song .
But it acknowledges , I think , some sadness . ''
