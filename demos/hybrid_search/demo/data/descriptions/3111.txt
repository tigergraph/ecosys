This was inspired by guitarist Waddy Wachtel , who helped Warren Zevon write `` Werewolves Of London . ''
In the liner notes to her TimeSpace album , Nicks said : `` There was a time when I was falling out of one love into another , when nothing else seemed to matter except this person .
I adored him ... he was everything I wanted to be ; a real rock and roller and a lover of The Stones ... small and frail sometimes , but in many ways the strongest person I have ever known .
His word was law .
became him , he became me , and no one dared intrude upon this union .
He is no longer with me , but his spirit twin never leaves him .
It was music combined with love , combined with the fact that when Waddy was beside me , I felt completely safe .
It is to my great sorrow that we are no longer on stage together , but it is to my great joy that he always seems to be with me , even after all this time .
Love is a word that some entertain ... If you find it , then you have won the game . ''
