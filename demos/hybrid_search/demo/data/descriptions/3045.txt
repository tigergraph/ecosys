Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies tells the stories of several different American outlaws and gunslingers of the 19th century .
This song tells the tale of the gentleman highwayman who wrote poems for the people he robbed on Wells Fargo stagecoaches in California and Oregon between 1875 and 1883 .
Black Bart was actually terrified of horses , so he committed all of his robberies on foot .
`` He was always a character I wanted to write about , but it had to be at the appropriate time , '' Volbeat vocalist and guitarist Michael Poulsen told BraveWords.com .
`` Since at least half of the album has those inspirations from western soundtracks , it was about time to bring him to life .
He fit the title so well , because he was an outlaw gentleman ; he 's one of my favourite characters on the album . ''
Poulsen told Classic Rock magazine why he chose to write about this particular highwayman .
`` Black Bart was definitely one of the most interesting and he always left that poem after robbing the stagecoach , '' he said .
`` We all know Doc Holliday so I wanted to bring in one character that people could see and think ` yeah , we know that guy . '
I did n't want to bring in Billy The Kid and Wyatt Earp or people like that because while they are interesting , I do n't think we need another story about them . ''
