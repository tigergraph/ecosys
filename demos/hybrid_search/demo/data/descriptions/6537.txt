This song is named after a '70s movie staring Clint Eastwood , who was the subject of another Gorillaz song .
-LRB- thanks , Spencer - Los Angeles , CA -RRB- Bootie Brown from the Pharcyde does a rap in this song and also appears in the video .
The video is mostly animated , but Brown appears in real form .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- The lyrics suggest that American president George W. Bush does n't care about the soldiers in the middle-east : `` The war is over so said the speaker , with a flight suit on , maybe to him I 'm just a pawn . ''
The words `` Dirty Harry '' do not appear in the lyrics , but the reference to Clint Eastwood 's gun-toting vigilante character implies that this is the way much of the world sees Bush .
-LRB- thanks , nick - kettering , OH -RRB- Demon Days was produced by Danger Mouse a year before he teamed up with Cee-Lo to form Gnarls Barkley .
He recalled to Q magazine June 2008 about recording the album : `` At first he -LRB- Damon Albarn -RRB- did n't want me to do the whole Gorillaz album or anything .
He was curious about me , to see whether we could work together .
The first track we did was ` Dirty Harry , ' which was a really raw , stripped-down demo .
I had this vision of choirs and Gregorian chants and rapping , and Damon was like , ` Well , go ahead and do it ! '
But Damon 's Songwriting is the strongest part of that record , not any fancy production .
It 's only when you have really good Songwriting that you can do all the other stuff .
That 's what allows me to do what I do .
He gave me respect and that sense of confidence .
His is the biggest influence anyone 's ever had on me . ''
