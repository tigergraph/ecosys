Michigan native Frankie Ballard flew to Venice Beach in Southern California to film the video for this summer anthem .
He told The Boot about the clip : `` This one is all about the girls , that 's what we wrote the song about .
It 's about how they do their thing .
They stick together and they always run in groups : girls ' night out , ladies night , they go to the bathroom together .
-LSB- laughs -RSB- They 're always hanging tight .
I wanted to write an anthem for them this summer , so when they 're hanging out , going to the beach or doing their thing , they 're cranking up this song . ''
