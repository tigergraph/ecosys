This is the closing track of American indie band , Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros second album , Home .
Frontman Alex Ebert told Artist Direct that he came up with the lyric and the melody without having picked up a guitar , something that does n't always happen .
The song 's music video features the band 's late fan , Sophia Glaser , wandering through a forest as it rains .
Sophia sadly passed away in her sleep due to a brain hemorrhage after entering the clip in a contest , but Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros were so moved by her creation that they made it their official music video for the track .
Ebert explained the song 's meaning to Artist Direct : `` There was this idea and this imagery of various people struggling , '' he said .
`` Then , in the best way possible , it just does n't matter in the end .
There 's a relaxation of allowance and muddying everything up in the sense that I think a lot of our hard lines will dissolve in a great sort of spiritual rain , if you will .
A lot of the divisions and the things so many people hold as paramount or important are going to be suddenly disappearing when the big rain happens .
I mean that in a metaphorical sense .
Maybe it 's death or some other time , but I do really feel that . ''
