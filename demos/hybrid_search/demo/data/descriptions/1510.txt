In this song front man Craig Finn recounts the story of attending a concert by 1980s American hardcore rock band Youth of Today where a fight breaks out and the band 's lead singer Ray Cappo hands him a Hare Krishna leaflet .
Finn explained to Pitchfork how autobiographical the song actually is .
Said Finn : `` I did see those shows .
Ray Cappo never tried to convert me into a Krishna , although one of his cohorts probably did .
I think it was just about being wrapped up in this thing .
Hardcore , at one point , meant everything to me .
Now you look back , and I still think it 's cool , but to some extent I grew out of it .
Other things became a bigger priority for me .
That chorus ends up with , ` Nobody wins at violent shows . '
That 's coming from the same thing .
It 's hard for me to imagine a show that you need to have a fight at , or anyone in the mindset of , ` Wow , I 'm fighting at a show . '
Or a show that you 'd go to , a hardcore show , where there 's six different fights .
Things are out of perspective at that point . ''
Guitarist Tad Kubler told Pitchfork why there 's a clarinet solo on this song .
He explained : `` I really wanted a clarinet solo on ` Cattle and the Creeping Things ' on our second record , and it never happened for various reasons .
So when I called Peter Hess to come in and do horns on a couple of songs , ` Barely Breathing ' being one of them , I said , ` Do you have a clarinet ? '
And he said , ' I do . '
And I said , ` Bring it , because I have an idea . '
I think the feel and the tempo of the song lends itself to that Dixieland-style solo .
It makes it exciting and interesting for us to try new things .
It 's always going to be a Hold Steady album , but if we go in with the intention of trying to do things differently , and to grow as a band , it 's going to keep us happy and interested . ''
