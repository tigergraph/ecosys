Frontman Alex Trimble told NME the story of this cut : `` This almost never became a song .
I had the chorus hook lying around for months , but I did n't propose it to the band because I never thought it would be a Two Door Cinema Club song .
It swung so much and it kind of sounded like a '40s or '50s jive thing .
But they liked it , and it became this weird , hip-hoppy , Motown-y song . ''
