This bluesy Southern rocker features the pedal steel of Robert Randolph .
Bassist Tai Anderson told Christian Music Today how Third Day hooked up with the guitar virtuoso : `` I 've been a big fan of Robert Randolph since I first saw him play at Gospel Music Week four or five years ago .
I wrote the riff for ` Otherside ' and immediately thought it sounded like something that Robert could absolutely nail .
Now that we 're under the same management , it was a breeze to work it out .
Robert took the song and blew it up ! ''
