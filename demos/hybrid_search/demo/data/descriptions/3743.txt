Drums frontman Jonathan Pierce grew up in a religious household but has since lost his faith .
This one of several tracks on their second album Portamento in which he attacks Christianity .
The song was inspired by Sam Harris ' book Letter To A Christian Nation .
Pierce told NME : `` I actually only read it this year , and it leaked into a lot of the lyrics on the album .
Sam Harris is an outspoken atheist .
Growing up in a very religious , almost cultish place , reading this book really sorted things out for me .
The first song on the album ` Book of Revelation , ' speaks of the revelation I had after reading the book . ''
