Every now and then Dylan will namecheck another musician in one of his songs , like he did with Alicia Keys in `` Thunder on the Mountain .
In `` I Feel A Change Comin ' On , '' he sings , `` I 'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver . ''
Shaver is a key mover in the `` Outlaw Country '' scene , a highly respected singer/songwriter whose songs have been recorded by Waylon Jennings , Willie Nelson and many others .
When we spoke with Shaver in 2010 , he told us : `` I 've never met Dylan , but I think the world of him , and I remember when I first heard him way back - I 've been writing songs since I was a kid , and when I heard his first tape , it upset me a little bit because I was real envious of that .
I took the tapes and threw them in the river .
I thought , God , what else is there to write about ?
-LRB- laughing -RRB- But I realized that if I 'd just be honest and be myself , that I would be different.Dylan impressed me so much .
He inspired me more than influenced me .
I think he 's probably the greatest writer that ever lived .
And he 's real cool , I like him .
I even like his singing real well .
He has a spiritualism or something to him . ''
Check out the guitar on this track - that 's Mike Campbell from Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers .
Among Campbell 's accomplishments : writing the music and playing on Don Henley 's hits `` The Heart Of The Matter '' and `` Boys Of Summer . ''
The Together Through Life album is n't the first time he 's worked with a Dylan ; Campbell played the guitar solo on `` Sixth Avenue Heartache '' by The Wallflowers , who are fronted by Bob 's son Jakob Dylan .
