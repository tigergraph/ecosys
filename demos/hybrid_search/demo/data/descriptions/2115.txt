Recorded in the same sessions as Bush 's reworking of old material , Director 's Cut , 50 Words For Snow comprises seven songs `` set against a background of falling snow . ''
`` I 'd had this idea for some while to do a wintry album , '' Bush explained to The Independent , `` and pretty soon after I started writing for it , I homed in to the idea of snow .
It just seemed such a fascinating subject that it was very easy to think of so many ways of writing about it .
It 's such extraordinary stuff , is n't it ?
Even a single snowflake , when you look at it under a microscope , is such an incredibly beautiful thing .
And apparently they are all different . ''
The album was released through the singer 's personal imprint , Fish People .
Whilst the Inuit did have about as many words for snow as the English -LRB- and now a lot less after Bush 's verbal creations for the frozen precipitation -RRB- , the Sami in Finland have in excess of 50 .
Speaking to American radio station KCRW , Bush said that the idea for this song came from thinking about the myth that the Inuit Eskimos have 50 words for snow .
She then decided to make up increasingly fantastical words herself , and recruited actor and writer Stephen Fry to recite the 50 synonyms .
They include such words/phrases as `` spangladasha , '' `` mountain-sob , `` blown from Polar fur , '' and `` shimmer-glisten . ''
Bush told The Independent , she did n't need to coach Fry with his delivery .
`` Really , it was just a case of focusing on the tone of it , him finding what his character was , because he is an absolutely brilliant actor .
And in a way , the softer he said them , the more beautiful they became , '' she said .
This is not Bush 's first wintry recording .
Back in December 1980 , the then 19-year-old singer recorded a Christmas single `` December Will Be Magic Again , '' which stalled at # 29 on the UK singles chart in the wake of John Lennon 's death .
