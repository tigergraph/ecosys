Brooks co-wrote this reflection on his college days with Jerrod Niemann and Richie Brown , who also were two of the co-authors of his 2005 single , `` Good Ride Cowboy . ''
Brooks told Great American Country TV : `` This -LSB- song -RSB- is my college days .
This is haulin ' hay during the daytime , then goin ' out to the Tumbleweed and dancin ' at the honky tonk at night .
And that 's what this -LSB- song -RSB- is .
If you think you hear the line ` dance 'til you 're sweatin ' like a rented mule ' , yes , you are ! ''
