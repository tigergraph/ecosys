Part of the lyrics for this song were penned by Randy Blythe in a fishing boat .
He told Kerrang !
: `` I wrote bits and pieces of different things .
I also figured out ` Visitation ' there as well .
I normally go into the studio with a lot of the lyrics already written , but I 'd go out on a boat .
I figured some of the lyrics out there . ''
The song is about envy , which is number 6 on the list of The Seven Deadly Sins .
Specifically , it concerns how the envious idiots that occupy message boards and unleash torrents of anonymous internet criticism are digging their own graves .
Blythe explained the hook -LRB- `` The number six .
Leviathan '' -RRB- to Kerrang !
`` In medieval times , they would assign each sin a demon , '' he said .
`` Envy 's is Leviathan .
That 's where the chorus comes from . ''
