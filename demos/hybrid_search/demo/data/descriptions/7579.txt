He replied : `` That was a totally throwaway , last-minute song .
We needed another song and I went , ` Oh , I suppose I 've got this one but it does n't really go anywhere . '
It became all about the drumbeat and the Sixties girl group hand-clapping .
It 's a really good example of having a good producer . ''
The album 's producer was Marius de Vries -LRB- Madonna , Bjork , Rufus Wainwright -RRB- .
Teddy Thompson is the son of two well-known music artists Richard and Linda Thompson .
In this song 's music video another child with famous musical parents Rufus Wainwright , makes a cameo appearance as Elvis Presley .
