This song about being at home during Christmas with family is the title track from Country music duo Sugarland 's first Christmas album .
It is one of five Christmas songs that Kristen Bush and Jennifer Nettles wrote for the project .
Bush told The Tennessean they were all about honesty and emotion : `` You have to be honest about the pictures you 're painting .
Songwriting is a balance between showing and telling , '' he explained .
`` Some things you can show by describing , and some things you have to tell .
If you show what it looks like outside , you do n't have to say you feel peaceful .
-LSB- Christmas -RSB- makes for a whole different palette when you 're writing those songs .
I just love that we got to do it ... and that when given the opportunity , we jumped at it - five times in a row ! ''
