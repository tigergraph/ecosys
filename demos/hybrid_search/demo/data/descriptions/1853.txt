This song describes the argument going on between the Writing Writer and Claudio as The Crowing .
It 's when Claudio comes face to face with the Writing Writer who is essentially the god of Claudio 's universe .
Claudio is confused and angry at this god who he has encountered because the Writing Writer is essentially letting Claudio know that he is going to destroy his universe by using him to accomplish this series of events that will result in the ultimate destruction of the universe that the Writing Writer has created .
This was done because something has happened in the Writing Writer 's life that has convinced him that in order for him to move on with his own existence he must destroy this universe he 's created .
At the very end of the song you hear the Writing Writer tell Claudio : `` I will not save your world , Your world in the end and you . ''
