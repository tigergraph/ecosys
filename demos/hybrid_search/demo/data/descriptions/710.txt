One Tree Hill actress and Country singer Jana Kramer premiered this song on the April 26 , 2011 episode of the young adult drama .
She told Just Jared : `` On the show , Quinn -LRB- Shantel VanSanten -RRB- asks Alex -LRB- Kramer -RRB- to perform a song at Club Trick and ` Whiskey ' seemed like such a good fit for this particular episode because the characters are all facing different areas of losses and finding ways to deal with the pain .
One of the things I love about the song ` Whiskey ' is that it 's something everyone can relate to because we 've all had moments in our life that we wish we could take back . ''
The song compares a man to whiskey .
Asked by The Boot if she likes whiskey , Kramer replied : `` It 's my second favorite drink .
Wine 's my favorite and then I love whiskey .
Just depends on the mood . ''
