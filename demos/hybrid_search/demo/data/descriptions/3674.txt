This song is about a divorced couple who every other weekend trade off the kids .
The couple still wishes that they where together , and for 15 minutes they feel like a family again .
This was written by Skip Ewing and Connie Harrington .
Ewing is also a singer , and duets with Reba on the single version of this song , singing from the perspective of the father .
For the album , Kenny Chesney sang the father 's part .
In the music video , Joanna Garc√≠a and Steve Howey , who were Cheyenne and Van Montgomery on the hit TV show Reba , play the roles as the two parents after the show had ended .
