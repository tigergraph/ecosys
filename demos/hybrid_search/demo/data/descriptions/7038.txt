Speaking with Artist Direct , Joe Garvey said the song 's guitar work came from him and his bandmates trying out and for this they dropped down to A-tuning .
`` It felt like we were Korn for a minute , '' he added , `` ripping out these low-end riffs that were as fun as hell to play . ''
Lyrically , this finds the Oklahoma City hard rockers catering to their female audience .
`` You 've got to keep the chicks happy , '' Garvey told Artist Direct .
`` They 're the ones who keep the guys at the concerts -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
It 's way easier to get along with a bunch of girls anyway -LSB- Laughs -RSB- . ''
