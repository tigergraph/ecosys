This is one of two new songs that appear on the reissue of the Postal Service 's Give Up .
The song features vocals from Rilo Kiley 's Jenny Lewis whilst Ben Gibbard sings on the chorus .
The song finds the narrator desperately trying to hold on to things he ca n't control .
`` I 've got a tattered line of string , '' sings Gibbard .
`` And I tie it round everything .
That I want to call my own .
But it never seems to hold . ''
