Frontman and chief songwriter Justin Young explained to the NME : `` I find talking to new people really hard .
Sometimes living in London and playing music you feel like people size you up when you 're talking to them .
They want to know what they can take from you and I hate that .
I 've never really liked people who try to hold court in social situations either , especially when I have n't had a chance to get to know them .
Maybe it 's because I 'd rather it was me .
Whatever the reason , this is an ode to my good friends . ''
