This electro-pop track is the debut international single of Eva Simons , a Dutch singer who boasts a bright red Mohawk .
She first came to public attention in Holland , after winning the Dutch version of the reality TV show Popstars .
Simons became a member of a girl group called Raffish , who had a # 1 hit in their home country with `` Plaything . ''
She was signed by EMI after this song was leaked onto YouTube and swiftly clocked up several million hits .
Its popularity was enhanced by many pop fans mistakenly guessing it was a demo by Lady Gaga or Rihanna .
Simons wrote this with Tearce , her co-writer and producer .
She told Digital Spy about the song : `` We wrote it in 2008 when I was working on my album .
It 's about a guy I know who 's an a -- hole .
Some people would call him a `` player '' or a `` Casanova '' , but those words have kind of become compliments .
There 's no way anyone could say ` Silly Boy ' is a compliment .
No guy wants to be called a silly boy .
`` Digital Spy asked Simons if the guy knows the song is about him .
She replied : `` I think he knows now because I 've been calling him ` Silly Boy ' for a while .
He 's down in my phone as ` Silly Boy ' too . ''
