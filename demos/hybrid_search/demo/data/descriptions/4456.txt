This song describes a relationship where the girl is too cautious and assumes she will suffer the same fate she has in the past if she trusts the singer enough to let it happen .
He wants to believe it was her indecisiveness that tore them apart because it would be painful to know that she was really that cold and calculating about leading him on .
The first chorus really opens up with how he feels .
The first line is , `` I do n't want to feel this way , '' meaning he did n't choose his feelings , they simply happened .
It could also mean that he feels almost victimized by the way he is treated since he does n't treat her the way that made her so cautious in the past .
The next lines in the chorus : `` I do n't want to say I 'm just a friend , I do n't want to wait around here , 'cause you do n't want to feel no pain again '' are in response to her telling him that she does n't want to be in a relationship yet , having probably imposed some kind of time period on staying single .
He calmly expresses his dissatisfaction with the holding pattern he 's been placed in .
It is n't his impatience , more his fear that this is just a nice way of being rejected .
He at least wants the closure if that 's what she is doing.The last lines in the chorus repeat throughout the song : `` We just lie about it , as we become shadows of ourselves . ''
Here , he expresses his frustration in being told to sweep his feelings under the rug and thus they become shadows of who they really are .
Later he questions if she really ever saw this working out , or if she was needlessly leading him on .
