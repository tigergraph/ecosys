This is one of several tracks on Fallen Empires to which US folk singer Lissie contributed vocals .
Snow Patrol lead singer Gary Lightbody told Billboard magazine : `` She came in for the day and she 's on 5 songs that made the album ... We wanted to get a female presence on the record .
I had the idea from Neil Young 's Harvest , Linda Ronstadt , that kinda recurs on the album so she came in and did a days work with us and what a day 's worth it was . ''
