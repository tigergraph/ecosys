This song about finding love and joy is the second single by the American Alternative Rock band Matchbox Twenty , taken from their fourth studio album , North .
Drummer Paul Doucette told Billboard magazine about the writing process for the set .
`` There would be guitars and pianos lying around and someone would spark an idea and then someone else would go , oh that 's great , try this , '' he said .
`` There 's no real set pattern on how it worked .
Whenever things really started to dive down and we were n't really coming up with anything , we 'd think of a game to try to get it going again .
One thing we did was , we got a little stuck , so we were like , `` Let 's start in the key of A , '' and we wrote a song in every single key . ''
The song 's music video begins with a married couple and their family , and moves in reverse to show the first meeting of the pair in elementary school .
It turns back around and moves forward showing them dating , getting wed and starting a family .
It ends with the elderly man and woman dancing in their kitchen .
