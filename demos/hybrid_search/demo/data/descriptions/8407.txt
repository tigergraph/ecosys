Suede vocalist Brett Anderson told NME about this romanticized paean to the outsider : `` It 's a swaying , languid thing that rocks , too .
If it 's referencing any previous Suede material , it 's the first three records .
We 've worked with Ed Buller , who produced those records .
The world wanted us to work with a hip , new producer , but it was always going to him . ''
