This is the first single from Texas metal band Oh , Sleeper 's third album , Children Of Fire .
It was released on August 2 , 2011 .
The track was the last to be written and first to be recorded for Children Of Fire .
Guitarist Shane Blay told the story of the song to Alternative Press magazine : `` Typically , I will write and record a song on my ProTools setup at home , then send it to Micah -LSB- Kinard , vocalist -RSB- and he writes his parts over it .
Our drummer Zac -LSB- Mayfield -RSB- and I had this 32-note kick pattern we messed with and I wrote the rest of it around that idea .
We recorded the entire record in track order .
None of us had heard Micah 's ideas for the vocals until he stepped behind the mic to record them .
We were blown away with what he was doing .
I wrote and recorded the -LSB- vocal -RSB- melodies the same day , and voila ! ''
