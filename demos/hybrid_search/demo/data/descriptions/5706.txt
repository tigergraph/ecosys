The video of this Bic Runga composition is reviewed by academic Matthew Bannister in a fashion worthy of Pseud 's Corner in the satirical Private Eye magazine.Writing in Many Voices : Music and National Identity in Aotearoa/New Zealand , he says it is `` locally located -LRB- in Cuba Street Mall , Wellington -RRB- , but the central conceit of the video is that Runga is a ghost -- invisible and immaterial .
Ordinary people and objects pass through her though there is a subtext that the emotional connections make things real .
Runga , while being of New Zealand , is not of it -- rather , she is a performer , a star , visible to all yet also removed and distant ; insular , communicating emotion and intimacy through her medium rather than directly '' .
The song runs to 3 minutes 17 seconds , and in 2003 , the video received the Best Solo Video award from the Auckland 24 hour music station Juice TV .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 3 -RRB- `` Something Good '' is totally different from the Utah Saints song of the same name released 10 years earlier , and the video matches the Kiwi golden girl 's enchanting melody to a tee .
