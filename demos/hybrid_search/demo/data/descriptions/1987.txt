This song finds Ayah Marar cooing about a romantic relationship .
The Jordanian singer/songwriter is a long-term collaborator with Harris , having first worked with the Scot on his 2004 song `` Let Me Know , '' which appears on The Unabombers ' Electric Soul 2 album .
She also featured on his Ready For The Weekend track , `` Stars Come Out . ''
The video was directed by Vincent Haycock , who has put together multiple visuals for Calvin Harris including `` Feel So Close '' and `` Sweet Nothing . ''
We see Ayah Marar being taken hostage on a boat while Hurts singer Theo Hutchcraft hosts a drug-fuelled party and cavorts with a group of topless models by the pool .
Harris does appear briefly as a DJ in a club.Hutchcraft is a good friend of Harris , as well as sharing the same manager and the pair decided the video was a good opportunity to collaborate .
The Hurts vocalist told Digital Spy that filming the clip was a `` crazy '' experience .
`` I do n't even know what 's going on .
We just had a party with loads of Russian girls - I did n't see the rest of it being made ! ''
he said .
`` We were in this weird Russian mansion on top of the hills - for us two it was crazy and a lot of fun . ''
Harris favors using female vocalists -LRB- think Rihanna and Florence Welch -RRB- .
He explained to The Guardian why he believes vocals by the fairer sex make for the best dance tracks : `` They 're always at the perfect frequency to play in a club , '' he said .
A good , soaring , high-mid female vocal bounces off the walls nicely , and it does n't interfere with the bass or drumbeat .
It 's basic science .
A man 's voice is likely to interfere with the bassline which is why you do n't hear many classic dance tracks with a male lead . ''
Calvin Harris first met Ayah Marar in 2004 in a London record shop and they went on to share a home for a brief period .
