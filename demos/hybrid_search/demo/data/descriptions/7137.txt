Mojo magazine reported that during a live show , Mann explained the song 's road-less-travelled subject matter was inspired by an episode of the US reality show Hoarders , in which one man 's compulsive hoarding had rendered his daughter homeless .
`` The thing I was fascinated by is that you have people who are desperate to help their loved ones who are living in squalor and often in dangerous circumstances , '' she explained , `` but the hoarders themselves do nothing but resent the help .
They just see that you 're trying to take their s -- t from them , and they constantly position themselves to be the victim of these people who are coming in trying to help .
It 's really delusional . ''
Mann titled the song `` Gumby '' as she `` thought it was a good name for a hoarder . ''
Apparently it has nothing to do with the claymation superstar .
