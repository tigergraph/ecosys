This catchy foot-stomper with the theme of heaviness turning to hope is the lead single of the Contemporary Christian musician Brandon Heath 's third studio album , Leaving Eden .
Written by Heath and Jason Ingram , `` Your Love '' was the pair 's first collaboration since their 2009 Dove Song of the Year success , `` Give Me Your Eyes . ''
Heath lives in Nashville , where there are no shortage of songwriters to collaborate with .
And while he finds it very rewarding to write a song on his own , working with another writer has it 's advantages .
Heath told us : `` There 's a few reasons why I co-write .
I do n't know that it 's necessarily the most comfortable process for me , because when I 'm writing alone , there 's no boundaries .
I feel a little more at ease , usually , just by myself .
But I enjoy the co-writing experience for a few reasons .
Number one , there 's a lot more motivation to finish what you started .
With me , I 'm kind of ADD and I 'll finish , like , a verse and a chorus and it may never get finished .
But with a co-writer , there 's an ' I do n't want to waste this guy 's time , so let 's try to finish it ' attitude . ''
