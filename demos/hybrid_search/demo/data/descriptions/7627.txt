`` Sour Times '' is n't exactly the feature single from Portishead 's first album , Dummy , but it might as well be .
It 's the one whose video samples scenes from their short film To Kill a Dead Man , whose images also make up the cover for the Dummy album.Let 's start with To Kill A Dead Man .
It 's a short film included on the bonus section of the 2002 DVD version of Portishead 's Roseland NYC Live .
We 'd be hard-pressed to describe it , beyond saying it 's a film-noir assassination story , sort of like if David Lynch made spy movies .

The eerie percussion and guitar were sampled from Lalo Schifrin 's `` Danube Incident , '' music composed by the Argentine composer for an episode of Mission Impossible .
`` Sour Times '' originally only charted as high as # 57 in the UK Singles ' chart .
Then after their single `` Glory Box '' made a big splash in the charts at # 13 , `` Sour Times '' was re-released and this time was really noticed.The album Dummy as a whole attracted critical acclaim and won the 1995 Mercury Music Prize .
It is also credited with founding the Trip-Hop genre .
This song is in fact a very good demonstration of the Trip-Hop style : moody , a little psychedelic , and containing just a lick of R&B roots .
British R&B group The 411 's 2004 Top 40 single `` Teardrops '' was built around a sample of `` Sour Times . ''
