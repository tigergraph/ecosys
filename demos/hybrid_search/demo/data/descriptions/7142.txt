This was the first hit for Poe .
It got a lot of play on `` Alternative '' radio stations .
This was inspired by Poe 's childhood and the death of her father .
She lived on her own after her parents divorced when she was 16 , and her father died a few years later .
Poe 's brother wrote a book in 2000 called House Of Leaves with a character named Johnny Truant .
That character is partly based on this song .
Matt Sorum , who was the drummer for Guns N ' Roses , played on this and helped produce the album .
Poe chose `` Johnny '' because it is the All-American name .
Poe toured with Lenny Kravitz while this was gaining popularity .
