Brice wrote this cut with Nashville songwriter Jim Collins -LRB- Keith Chesney 's `` The Good Stuff , '' Carrie Underwood 's `` Look At Me '' -RRB- .
Said Brice : `` Jim Collins is a genius songwriter .
He said , `` I 've got this hook , ` Do n't Believe Everything You Think . ' ''
And it just went straight to me , because I 'd started thinking a lot more seriously about the future .
But my girlfriend , Sara , had these episodes where she 'd say , ` We are not on the same page !
I 'm more ready than you ! '
Well , I did n't want her to necessarily know when or if a proposal was coming .
I 'd go , ` Hush , quit being crazy !
You know I love you , and I 'm going to ask you .
But quit messing with me .
Leave me alone ! '
So we wrote this song and now I 'm getting married . ''
