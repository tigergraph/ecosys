Mike Mogis of Monsters of Folk recalled the recording of this song to Express Night Out : `` That 's one that was in the Malibu sessions , so for the Malibu recording session the songs came in there more completed .
We 'd already done the first bulk of it in Omaha and people were stoked about it , we all went our separate ways , tours and so forth .
Those came in more completed form .
That one I do n't think we really messed .
That might have been one of the most completed songs coming into it .
He demoed it and sent it to us and we tried to stay true to it because we all liked it . ''
