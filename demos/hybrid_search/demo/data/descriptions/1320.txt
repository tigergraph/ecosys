The foundations of Jennifer Lopez ' seventh studio album , Love ?
can be traced back to late 2007 and early 2008 , during her pregnancy with twins Emme and Max .
While pregnant , and later at home after giving birth , Lopez worked on new music for future projects .
The record was eventually released on April 29 , 2011 but because of its long gestation period , several tracks were leaked prematurely .
One of the incomplete songs that popped up on the net was this Wynter Gordon penned tune .
The songwriter , who worked closely with Lopez on the project , addressed the leak in a personal blog through her official MySpace page , in which she expressed her discontent that an unfinished , unmastered version appeared prematurely .
She posted : `` I wrote this song from a deep place in my heart .
If the world was gon na hear it , I wanted them to hear it right ... It 's as good as gone to me now ... The story was given a Lifetime TV special instead of a movie ... sad . ''
Gordon explained the song 's meaning in the same blog .
She said , '' -LSB- What Is Love is about -RSB- not knowing what love is ... I felt like so many woman have that same story .
No fathers , families , abusive boyfriends and husbands . .
no parental support , they feel alone . .
I 've had my few relationships and have yet to feel love -LSB- sic -RSB- . ''
