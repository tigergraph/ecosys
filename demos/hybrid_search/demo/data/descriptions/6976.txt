This is the second single from Country music artist Chris Young 's sophomore studio album , The Man I Want To Be .
While mixing the song in the studio , Young 's grandparents stopped by .
The singer told Country Weekly their presence made him a little nervous .
Said Young laughing : `` All day long goes by , and we were on the seventh or eighth song .
I thought , ` Well , they 're not coming .
We might as well do ` Gettin ' You Home . '
Obviously it 's one of the more sexier songs on the record .
So we get ready to start mixing it and of course as soon as we do , they walk in .
The whole time I 'm going , ` This is not going to go well ! '
They heard it one time , and my grandmother looks up and goes , ' I just love that song ! '
I 'm looking at her thinking I do n't know whether to be really excited that she likes it or what !
So that became her favorite song on the album . ''
Chris Young is the first Nashville Star contestant to top the Country chart .
-LRB- He was the 2006 Nashville Star champion -RRB- .
On this suggestive song Young sings about his date 's black dress .
Much as she looks nice in it , all he can think about is `` gettin ' -LSB- her -RSB- home '' and seeing her black dress hit the floor .
When this reached # 1 on Hot Country Songs , it was the first single on the RCA label to achieve this feat since Sara Evans led the tally with `` A Real Fine Place to Start '' four years previously , in September 2005 .
