Nash explained to Mojo magazine March 2010 that this song refers to `` panicking before you go to sleep - it 's a bridge between the first album and this one . ''
A demo version of this song appeared as a B-side on the single `` Merry Happy , '' which was released on March 24 , 2008 in the UK .
Nash told The NME : `` I wrote it in Australia .
At the beginning there 's this broken relationship that needs fixing but seems unfixable and it 's quite frightening . ''
