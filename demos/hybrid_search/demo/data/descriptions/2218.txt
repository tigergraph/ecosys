Frontman Ed Macfarlane told the NME June 27th 2009 that this song is inspired by Brazilian music .
He explained : `` All the rhythms are traditional samba rhythms .
All our brass layers from our recent tour drum for the London School Of Samba , so they 've been giving us some ideas . ''
Macfarlane had the idea to sample and loop samba drums while hanging out at London 's Brazilian club Guanabara .
He enthused to The Guardian August 22 , 2009 : `` There 's nothing like hearing a huge troupe of drummers playing this massive rhythm , surrounded by beautiful dancing girls in amazing attire and everyone screaming their heads off , '' he enthuses .
`` It 's dance music at its most exciting and energetic .
It had the atmosphere of the best techno raves . ''
Friendly Fires worked on the song with British producer Paul Epworth -LRB- Bloc Party , Kate Nash -RRB- .
The trio had worked with Epworth before , including on their previous single `` Jump in the Pool . ''
However previously their collaborations did n't go , er , swimmingly .
Macfarlane admitted to the NME : `` We did work with Paul before that and it was a disaster .
But we 've come round to the idea that maybe producers do have a purpose .
When we worked with him in his own little box room studio it worked , whereas when you 're flung together in some high-class studio it 's quite awkward . ''
