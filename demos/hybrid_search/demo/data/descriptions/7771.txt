During an interview with Digital Spy , Coyle was asked about the guitar playing at the end of the song .
She replied : `` Would you believe that 's a friend of mine playing guitar there - it 's incredible !
I just wanted him to show off and that 's exactly what he did .
After all , it 's what I 'm doing on this album too !
I confess to doing a bit of air guitar when I hear it , but I know when I 'm on stage singing it with the whole band behind me , I 'm going to go really mad . ''
