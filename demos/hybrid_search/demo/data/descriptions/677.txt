According to Weezer guitarist Brian Bell , this song is about a spider .
Weezer started working on Make Believe on December 1 , 2003 and finally released it on May 10 , 2005 - 11 years after The Blue Album .
Recording this and other tracks on the album required a lot of patience from the band and producer Rick Rubin , as lead singer Rivers Cuomo worked meticulously on demos for the album .
