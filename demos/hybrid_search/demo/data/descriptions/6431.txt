Chad Kroeger sings of breaking into his high school .
Asked by NME how many times he did so , he replied : `` Well , I say I did it half a dozen times , but I was charged with 11 counts of breaking and entering ... it did n't rhyme though . '
I must have done it , pause , 11 times ' does n't quite fit as well as half a dozen . ''
