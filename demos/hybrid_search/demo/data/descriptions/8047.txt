Joy Williams and John Paul White of The Civil Wars wrote this song one cold night in a Paris flat , with the Eiffel Tower in full view .
Williams recalled : `` Tall windows , Victorian furniture , and somehow the atmosphere of all of that seeped into the song .
-LRB- Her husband -RRB- Nate and our friends were there in the room as we wrote , all of us drinking wine together . ''
An English translation of the start of the song is : `` When I walk in the street .
The street to the Sacred Heart . ''
The Sacré-Cœur -LRB- Sacred Heart -RRB- Basilica is a Roman Catholic church in Paris .
It is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus , an increasingly popular vision of a loving and sympathetic Christ .
The church was planned in 1873 with the aim of expiating the spiritual and moral collapse of France , which was felt to have led to the defeat of the French by the Prussians .
Its location on the summit of the butte Montmartre , -LRB- ` martyrs mount ' -RRB- , the highest point in the city , was deliberate .
Williams sings the song in French .
She recalled : `` I wrote what words I knew in French , and then had a Parisian friend named Renata Pepper -LRB- yes , that 's her real name -RRB- look it over later and help me translate .
When we recorded the song for the album , I called in a French professor from Vanderbilt named Becky Peterson , who has now become a good friend . ''
