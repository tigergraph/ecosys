This song is most likely based on how the band 's sound has progressed and changed throughout the years .
Critics have branded Millencolin as `` sell-outs '' upon the release of previous albums .
With lyrics like , `` It 's in my nature to be changing .
Now is it so hard to see ?
You can not make me to be someone who never will be changing . ''
and `` Cause I change with time and that 's not a crime , '' it seems that Millencolin have n't been too phased by such accusations .
