This song seems strangely out of place on the Bad Reputation album among tracks with titles like `` Killer Without A Cause '' and `` Opium Trail , '' but although an extrovert and hard drinking womanizer , Phil Lynott was also an unabashed Catholic .
The song , which he co-wrote with guitarist Scott Gorham , is a sort of prayer asking for his vanity and other character flaws to be forgiven .
`` Dear Lord '' features a `` choir '' which was composed entirely of Mary Hopkin .
She is best known for her 1968 hit `` Those Were The Days , '' but in 1977 she was the wife of producer Tony Visconti .
He made 16 separate recordings of her voice .
