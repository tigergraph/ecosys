This track not only musically slows down the pulse , but it also seems to wrap up the album in a sentimental , philosophical way .
When we spoke with lead singer Chris Henderson , he explained : `` The concept of this tune is simple in theory , yet many people -LRB- myself included -RRB- seem to have a hard time executing : If you are unhappy or unsatisfied , do something to change it .
Do n't stick around here to feed the mouth that bites you .
I was hoping the lyrics could apply to anyone who recognizes that they could have something better and that the only way to do it was make the change happen for yourself . ''
Henderson has spoken before about his pre-music gigs , and one ca n't help but wonder if , at some point along that path , he was driven to take his own advice after the droning 9-5 world .
`` I was more or less a butler/personal assistant to a lawyer in Hartford .
We do n't have enough time in the day to talk about that job -- it was interesting working with a very quirky gentleman . ''
