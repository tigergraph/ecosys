This bluesy track features guitar work from Jack White , whom Steve first met at the UK Reading Festival in 2008 .
Steve told Mojo magazine that he is in awe of White 's contribution .
`` I could spend the rest of my life trying and I 'd never come up with anything like that , '' he said .
`` It 's real crazy but it makes sense .
It 's like it came from Mars or something . ''
The album title came from a hub cap given to Steve by Jack White that he turned it into a guitar with the help of a garden hoe .
The veteran bluesman told The Sun , `` I was out in America and did n't plan to do any shows , so I only had my three-string guitar with me and a normal guitar .
I 'd gone to Jack White 's place in Nashville to do a single with him .
As a present , he gave me a hubcap from an old 30s car called the Hudson Terraplane .
`` Then I was out in California and I got asked to do some show , '' he continued .
`` The only trouble was I did n't have my Morris Minor hubcap guitar with me .
So I found another hubcap , got a garden hoe and banged it all together with the one Jack gave me .
Then I went on the beach and found a piece of driftwood and made that into a Bo Diddley guitar .
I had no instruments , so I made them .
As all these hubcaps were flying around , I called the album Hubcap Music . ''
