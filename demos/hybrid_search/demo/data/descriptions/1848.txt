Buckcherry lead singer Josh Todd told Q magazine : `` The title came from a guy 's knuckles .
He had that tattooed across the back of his fingers .
I thought that was really brave .
He was a really interesting character , and while he was n't the inspiration for the song he did inspire the title .
The song is about people who come around after you 've had some success .
You know that as soon as the fame is over they 're moving on to the next thing . ''
