Minaj discussed this boisterous hip-hop cut on a track by track on her website : '' -LRB- The song -RRB- is a ball of cocky arrogant diva bitchy insanity !
Sometimes u just wan na 'S -- T on 'em ' lol .
This arrogance comes only when u mix the cute ghetto girl with the queen of England . ''
The song features the lyric : `` If you could turn back time , Cher / You used to be here , now you 're gone , Nair . ''
One of Cher 's fans tweeted the singer/actress to inform her that Nicky Minaj had `` dissed '' her on the track .
Cher responded with a tweet of her own , writing , `` Ive seen lots of people come & go !
No biggie ! ''
However , after one of Minaj 's friends accused her of misunderstanding a rap metaphor , Cher deleted the anti-Minaj posts , admitting she was wrong , saying , `` Someone said I was dissed ... I 've been dissed b4 , but instead of finding out ... I just got defensive !
I should have known better !
Dumb . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Young Money aficionado DJ Scoob Doo and is compiled of clips from the I Am Still Music Tour , backstage moments with Drake and Lil Wayne , and photo shoots from various magazines .
Scoob told MTV News the plan all along was to shoot the clip in the rugged style seen in the clip .
`` It took me about a good two weeks to put all of the ideas that we had together .
The good thing about the video is that we went in knowing we were gon na shoot the video onstage a few times .
I was actually able to get my camera crew onstage , '' he shared .
