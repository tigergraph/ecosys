This song was written by Patti Smith 's drummer Jay Dee Daugherty , who has played with the Punk Rock godmother since 1975 .
She told Spinner that her late husband , Fred `` Sonic '' Smith , `` who was very discriminating , told me he was one of the best drummers in rock 'n' roll . ''
Regarding Daugherty 's songwriting , Smith told Spinner ; `` He 's also such an interesting musician as a composer .
He does n't write a lot of songs but he 's written so many unique songs .
Like ` Do n't Say Nothing ' -LSB- from Peace and Noise -RSB- .
He wrote the title track from Easter .
His music is always set apart from anyone else .
On this -LSB- album -RSB- , the song that he wrote is really unique .
I love that track .
` Mosaic . '
And he always writes on a different instrument -LSB- so -RSB- it 's always a surprise .
He wrote ` Easter ' on some kind of synthesizer . ''
