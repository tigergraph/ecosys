Vocalist Jonathan Higgs described this to The Line Of Best Fit as `` a family break-up/divorce sort of song , '' adding that it is , `` a conversation between partners : you take the family , I 'll take the car . ''
He added : `` It 's got flippancy to it but with a suicide overtone .
And then , a bit like ` Undrowned ' , it starts losing it a bit .
Going on about : is n't there anything more than this ?
Feeling pretty dejected . ''
