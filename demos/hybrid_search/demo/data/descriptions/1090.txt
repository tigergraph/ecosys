This is based on an Emily Dickinson poem , Essential Oils - are wrung : Essential oils are wrungThe attar from the roseIs not expressed by suns alone , It is the gift of screws .
Buckingham 's Fleetwood Mac bandmates Mick Fleetwood -LRB- drums -RRB- and John McVie -LRB- bass -RRB- provided the rhythm section on this track .
Buckingham told Live Daily that whilst McVie came in later and laid the bass tracks down , he particularly had a great time recording with Fleetwood .
Said Buckingham : `` If you focus on Mick , we 've always had a camaraderie of spirit ; we 've always shared that sense of pushing the envelope , and he has a really animal style of playing drums in particular .
So , on the title track , I think Mick just felt completely liberated to do what he loves to do best and does n't always get to do in the context of Fleetwood Mac , which is to present a complete male energy out there , and to not worry about whether it holds a line in terms of taste or anything else .
It 's just a raw , primal expression .
It 's something he and I both love to do , really appreciate , and I think he hoped ' A Gift of Screws ' ended up on a Fleetwood Mac album so that he could have gotten to play it .
But we just had a ball in the studio -- it was great fun . ''
This was originally recorded for Fleetwood Mac 's 2003 album Say You Will , but was not included on the final set .
