This song finds Brandon Flowers exploring a familiar theme of being unable to , `` escape the rising tide . ''
First played at one of the warm up shows for their London Hyde Park concert in June 2011 , it was omitted from the set list at their headline event .
Drummer Ronnie Vannucci recalled to Spotify : `` When we got back together we had these writing sessions where we 'd take a month and work every day .
Rising Tide was the first complete song that came from those sessions .
We put it on the back burner and forgot about it and then unearthed it again later . ''
