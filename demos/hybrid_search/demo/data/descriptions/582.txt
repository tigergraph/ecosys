Kaskade 's fourth single from his Fire & Ice album is a collaboration with American Dubstep producer Skrillex .
`` Collaborating with Skrillex for the track and video of ` Lick It ' was one of the more unique opportunities I had when recording Fire & Ice , '' Kaskade told MTV News .
`` Skrillex and I have different styles , but that is part of what made it fun .
I like doing the unexpected , and this track and video is something truly distinctive . ''
L.A.-based filmmaker and photographer Sean Stiegemeier directed the song 's music video .
His other credits include several clips for American Metalcore give-piece Atreyu .
Filmed entirely in reverse in a freezing Iceland , the visual depicts a music-loving girl , played by Icelandic actress and soccer player Aníta Lísa Svansdóttir , frantically in search of tunes .
`` The video was shot in a small town on the south coast of Iceland , '' Stiegemeier revealed to MTV News .
`` Weather and light were a tough factor , with only four hours of daylight and blizzards storming through the shoot . ''
`` It was the most physical shoot that I have done , '' the director added .
`` Because the camera was attached to the actress as she had to run backwards the entire time , also uphill , on ice , while bleeding out of her ears .
Fortunately , she is a professional soccer player and did an amazing job . ''
