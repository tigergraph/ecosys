In this song a younger man journeys to ask an old man three questions :1 -RRB- What do you do with the pieces of a broken heart ?
2 -RRB- How can a man like me remain in the light ?
3 -RRB- If life is really as short as they say , then why is the night so long ?
This is reminiscent of the Leo Tolstoy morality story The Three Questions , in which an emperor decides that if he knows the answers to three questions , he will never stray in any matter .
While the younger man seems to be focused on personal issues , the emperor is more concerned with the right way to act : 1 -RRB- What is the best time to do each thing ?
2 -RRB- Who are the most important people to work with ?
3 -RRB- What is the most important thing to do at all times?In the Tolstoy story , the emperor `` finds the answers '' when he unknowingly helps a person who is trying to hurt him .
In this song , the old man simply tells the younger man he is a `` young fool who is afraid to do the things he has to do . ''
In an April 2007 interview , M. Ward describes songwriting as a form of art : `` I 'm really open to interpretations for anything involved with art , and I think that leaving room for people to use their intuition is doing a favor for the audience and the artwork .
I 'm much more interested in having a song that can have 100 meanings to 100 different people than having a song that can only be interpreted in one way . ''
