Clapton is saying that we live on through our children , generation after generation .
He `` knew '' his father -LRB- finally -RRB- when he looked in his son 's eyes , and realized they were his father 's eyes .
In the lyric , `` Just a toe rag on the run , '' `` Toe Rag '' is a slang term for a small child , street child , perhaps , in England .
-LRB- thanks , Steve - Long Island , NC , for all above -RRB- Clapton was raised by his grandparents , who he thought were his parents until he was in his teens .
Growing up , he never knew his father , who only contacted him after Eric was famous .
The sadness at not having a relationship is evident in this song .
