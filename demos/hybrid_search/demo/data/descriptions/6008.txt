She Wants Revenge is an American musical post punk/electronica duo , based in San Fernando Valley , California , consisting of vocalist Justin Warfield and programmer Adam 12 '' Bravin .
The group released their third album , Valleyheart on May 23 , 2011 .
Warfield told AntiMusic why this opens the album .
He explained : `` To me this song was the anchor of the record and really had to be special .
I always imagined it being the first song on the LP and to me it sets things up nicely , plus I love the innocence of the story of the couple and the sentiment .
It 's big and epic , soaring and hopeful in a way that is almost naive , but then again , that is pretty much how that sort of thing makes you feel - invincible . ''
The group put this song together looking for something that would sound good in a club .
Warfield told AntiMusic that the beat was a `` homage '' to the Eric B. & Rakim song , ` Paid In Full . '
After programming the beat , they added the bassline and guitar , and moved around various sections of the song .
Said Warfield : `` Vocally this song was one of the hardest , and it really took me two or three versions -LRB- lyrics and melody -RRB- before Adam and I were both happy and felt it was there .
Once we eliminated the original chorus progression things really took shape and became clear , at which point writing the lyrics and melody were easier .
After several failed attempts , one day I was sitting in the studio singing along while playing acoustic guitar and I just started singing the chorus .
Sometimes it takes weeks or months to eliminate all the things it is n't to find out what it is , and this was one of those cases .
I immediately put down the acoustic , pushed rewind , hit record and sang it into the mic , and at that point not only was the chorus written and feeling special , but the narrative of the song and verses became clear as well . ''
