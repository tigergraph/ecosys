On this song , Gnarls Barkley lyricist Cee-Lo confesses that suicide has crossed his mind .
He told Rolling Stone August 2006 that he makes music and writes lyrics , like on this song , to help him get to heaven : `` I want to please in the sight of my maker and my mother .
I 'm gaining favor .
A lot of my music is to ease my rite of passage , just in case ... When was the last time you heard a black man talk about suicide ?
It 's meant to be therapeutic .
If you questioned where you stood , sanity-wise , before you heard -LSB- St Elsewhere -RSB- , I think it would cause a moment of clarity more than it would push you over the edge . ''
