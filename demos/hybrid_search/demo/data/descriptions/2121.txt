This song features vocal assistance from friend of Mastodon , Scott Kelly of Neurosis .
Vocalist and bassist Troy Sanders told Kerrang !
: `` This is probably the heaviest track on the album .
Scott Kelly from Neurosis sings the vocals on the middle section .
I think this is the fourth album in a row that he 's been on for us , and it came together really nicely with him .
The song itself is tough as nails .
It 's got quite the brutality going on .
It 's a complete scorcher .
It 's a face-melter . ''
Guitarist Bill Kelliher told MusicRadar.com this was a song that Dailor `` mostly came up with . ''
He added : `` When we got into the studio , I changed around some parts .
I dropped down the tuning to make it sound more evil .
It was a little too happy at first , so I tuned it down to A again.The magic glue to the song is the little staccato bit that holds sections together .
-LRB- Producer -RRB- Mike Elizondo and I butted heads on that -- he thought it was unnecessary , but I stuck to my guns .
There 's a lot of open , dissonant notes on it -- I like how crazy and twisted they sound .
Open notes give you a warbly texture . ''
