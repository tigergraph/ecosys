The first single from George Strait 's 28th studio album is a romantic ballad penned by Nashville songwriters Tim James , Phil O'Donnell and Mark Bright .
`` The song has a very unusual melody and very cool phrasing , which I 've always been drawn to , '' shared Strait , who once again collaborated with longtime producer , Tony Brown , on the music .
It was released on October 29 , 2012 .
The song reached the top of the Mediabase charts as the most played song on Country radio .
Fans and fellow artists alike had joined the ` Sixty For Sixty ' campaign to help accomplish the historic milestone of giving George his 60th # 1 single while he was 60 years old .
It came down to the last minute as it finally reached # 1 a few days before the Nashville legend 's 61st birthday .
In doing so , George became the first artist in any genre of music to place 60 songs at the top of the charts .
George was initially unsure if he 'd be able to capture the song .
`` I had n't done any recording in quite a while , and so I really did n't have anything to put out , but I was trying to find a few songs just to go in and cut , '' he said .
`` So , I was listening to stuff constantly , every day .
The first time I heard it I thought , ` Hmm , that 's a great song .
-LSB- It 's -RSB- a little different for me , you know , a little risqu√© kinda . '
I 'm thinking , ' I do n't know if I can pull this off or not . '
But , I talked with -LSB- UMG 's -RSB- Brian -LSB- Wright -RSB- a little bit about it , and he said , ` Sure you can .
You can do it . '
I said , ` Alright .
We 'll try it . '
So , we did , and I just love it .
I mean , it 's , like I said , it 's a little different , the melody 's a little different , great lyrics .
It 's kinda about parking , -LSB- laughs -RSB- which I 've done a few times back in the early days .
-LSB- laughs -RSB- ''
