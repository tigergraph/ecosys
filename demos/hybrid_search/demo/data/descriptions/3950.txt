This was written by Kelly Clarkson in Irvine , California while on tour .
She wrote it in the bathroom of her dressing room while performing at the Irvine Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre .
Clarkson told The Daily Mail -LRB- June 22 , 2007 -RRB- : `` I had reached my lowest point .
I thought : ' I do n't want to smile or talk about myself , or do a photo shoot .
I do n't want to do anything . '
Four or five years straight of doing this stuff caught up on me .
Everyone wanted to keep it going and I could n't .
Even though I love my job , I could n't do it all the time . ''
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England -RRB- Clarkson described this on her record label 's website as `` the saddest song I 've ever written . ''
She added : `` The song is a prayer from the lowest point in my life .
There comes a time when you feel like , if He 's up there , God , Allah or whatever you want to call Him , is the only one that can help me out .
After that night , I know there 's someone or something out there looking out for me . ''
