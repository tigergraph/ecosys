This Rebel track finds Christian rapper Lecrae rhyming about the battle between his flesh and his spirit in the form of a conversation with his sinful nature .
When we spoke with Lecrae , he explained the song originated from a time he faced temptation when he was on his own in a hotel room .
He said : `` There was a time when I was in Texas , at a show by myself .
I usually travel with people , but for whatever reason , I ended up being out there by myself .
I was in my hotel room , and there was so much temptation and so many things around me , it was like I had to fight and wrestle through them .
So I thought to just to write about what I was experiencing and write about that wrestle .
And just to reflect on the truth that would help with things in the midst of that wrestle .
That 's really how that song came about , just me talking about the truth of God . ''
