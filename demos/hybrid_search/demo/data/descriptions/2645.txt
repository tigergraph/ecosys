This song is about a guy who is frustrated with a girl who he needs `` like a bad habit . ''
He is frustrated that she turned him into what he is now : `` Well my best side was your worst invention . ''
He keeps asking her why wo n't she ever be happy and is determined not to come back down and stoop to her level .
-LRB- thanks , Amina - Toronto , Canada -RRB- Taking Back Sunday 's song titles often have nothing to do with the songs themselves .
In this case , the title comes from a bet made between the band and their guitarist Eddie Reyes .
The bet was that he could n't lose enough weight to slim down to 180 pounds by summer .
