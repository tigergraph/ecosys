The French electronic music duo Daft Punk open their fourth studio album Random Access Memories with this relaxed shuffle with a Californian vibe that affirms the message `` Let the music of your life , give life back to music . ''
This features guitar by Nile Rodgers .
Speaking in a video , the Chic songwriter and guitarist admitted that Daft Punk were `` cooler '' than he had thought they would be .
`` As artists we follow each other 's careers and they were cooler than I thought , '' he confessed .
`` The best collaborations in my life are when the people you work with are as good as you expect and then even better than that .
You realise that the person brings more to the party because you inspire that other artist to go to another level as they do you .
`` He added : `` When I worked with the guys , it was n't like I was just Nile Rodgers doing a session or collaborating ; it was being inspired by people and artists that make you up your game . ''
The song features stick work by John Robinson Jr. , a session musician who played drums on Michael Jackson 's Off the Wall album .
Daft Punk told French publication Le Nouvel Observateur that they were heavily influenced by the production of Quincy Jones , -LRB- who helmed Off The Wall -RRB- saying that the precision has never been replicated .
