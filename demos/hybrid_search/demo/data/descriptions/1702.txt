This song is about a guy who only feels pain when he is with a girl who he used to love .
He still loves her but something has happened that causes him pain when he is with her .
In the Live In Texas version it says , `` When I look into your eyes there 's nothing left to see , nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me . ''
This refers to how he can only see how much pain he has inflicted on someone he loves when he looks at her .
He ca n't stand that feeling anymore .
-LRB- thanks , Hillary - fort worth , TX -RRB- In the remix of this song -LRB- `` P5hng Me Aw * y '' -RRB- , he says , `` When I look into your eyes , there 's nothing there to see .
Nothing but my own mistakes , staring back at me . ''
This says he made a big mistake being with her .
In her eyes he sees his reflection , but it 's him as a miserable person .
