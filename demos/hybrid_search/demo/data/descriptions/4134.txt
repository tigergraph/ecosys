This is the opening track from Jersey-born singer-songwriter Nerina Pallot 's third studio album , The Graduate .
The song title is a clear nod to American author Dave Eggers .
Pallot admitted to The Independent October 30 , 2009 : `` I 'm lazy , so if I 'm stuck for a title , I 'll nick it from a book . ''
She added that the inspiration for the song runs deeper : `` I was thinking about the opening section of the book , where rabbis are arguing about where we find the God in ourselves .
I was brought up a Catholic , being told I was s -- t and must repent .
How can anyone find any joy in themselves then ? ''
