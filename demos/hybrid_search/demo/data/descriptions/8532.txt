This song is about the escapist joys of living on a park bench .
The London Times August 5 , 2009 asked Peyroux if she really meant the lyric about leaving the rat race , ditching the house and the car ?
The American singer-songwriter replied : `` That 's not about me as such .
I wrote a bunch of short stories to look at what I might write about on the record .
One of them was about a very cheerful man I remembered who was homeless .
I think the point of the song is to challenge people to think about what makes you happy . ''
Peyroux added : `` I mean I do n't have a big car , a big house - I 've got a little apartment in Brooklyn - I 'm not saying I 've figured it out , I 'm more just raising the issue .
It would be silly to suggest homelessness is a prescription for happiness . ''
