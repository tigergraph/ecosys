The third single from AM , this is the last in the album 's trilogy of question-mark songs following `` R U Mine ? ''
and `` Do I Wan na Know ? ''
The song 's music video was directed by the Chicago-born photographer Nabil Elderkin and recorded the Monday after the band 's Glastonbury headline performance .
It finds a drunk Alex Turner hallucinating as he leaves a the Howl At The Moon pub in Hoxton , London , where he 's been drinking with his bandmates .
The singer and stumbles through the streets of East London repeatedly texting a girl called Stephanie in a fairly literal interpretation of this ode to booty calls and debauchery .
`` I had no idea the shoot was going to be so explicit , '' model Lamie Stewart , who plays Stephanie , told NME .
`` I missed an email , so when I turned up I was like ... riiiight !
The scene where I have sex with the man in the kebab shop was quite hilarious , especially : the kebab guy was actually the sweetest thing .
He was more nervous than I was !
I 've been a fan of the band for a very long time , since 6th form , so was very happy when I won the role to be in the video , despite being passed around via Alex 's drunken mind state ! ''
Set at 3am at some party , frontman Alex Turner told Q magazine the song was inspired by a voicemail he got `` along those lines . ''
The 3am hour seems to inspire a lot of songs .
`` 3 AM '' by Matchbox Twenty and `` 25 Or 6 To 4 '' by Chicago both take place in this timeframe .
This was the Arctic 's first song to make the Top Ten on the UK singles chart since their 2007 # 5 hit `` Fluorescent Adolescent . ''
