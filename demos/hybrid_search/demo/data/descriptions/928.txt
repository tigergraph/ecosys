Peace is an Alternative Rock band from Birmingham , UK .
The group consists of vocalist Harry Koisser , his bassist brother Sam Koisser , guitarist Douglas Castle and drummer Dominic Boyce .
The band started getting attention in early 2012 from the British rock press , attracting the attention of various labels and were soon signed by Columbia .
This indie anthem is a single from their debut EP Delicious .
The lyrics were inspired by the tedium of Kossier 's job .
He explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` It 's kind of about being a bit bored and a bit gloomy , wandering around Birmingham carrying this sign .
But I guess the main theme of the song is that things can only get better . ''
The song came to Harry Kossier during a Saturday job , which involved him holding a sign outside the Bullring in Birmingham .
He told NME : `` I was just standing around humming to myself , noting down ideas and trying to memorise certain lines , and ` California Daze ' kind of came out of that .
`` He continued : `` I knew I had to remember it .
I remember thinking to myself , ` This is n't too bad ! '
I wrote some stuff down on my phone and came up with the music after the melody . ''
