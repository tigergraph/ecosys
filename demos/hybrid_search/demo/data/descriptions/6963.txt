This is a cover of a 2009 release by the Norwegian Choir of Young Believers .
It was Warner Music International marketing executive Dion Singer who brought the tune to Groban 's attention .
`` It 's such a cinematic song , '' Groban said at a listening party at the Sunset Towers in West Hollywood , adding that producer Rob Cavallo told him `` I feel there is a cityscape in it .
So we went out on Sunset Boulevard and recorded traffic . ''
