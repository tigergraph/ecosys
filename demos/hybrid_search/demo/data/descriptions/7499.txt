DiFranco is well recognized as a feminist icon , and this song finds her exploring civil rights for women , a topic few other female singers have sung about .
She told The Independent newspaper : `` I 've had conversations with young artists , and -LSB- they 've said -RSB- , ` Your envelope-pushing emboldened me . '
It 's great to hear , but I wonder how far I can take it .
If it 's my job to go out on a limb in order to encourage others to climb the tree , how far along that limb can I go ? ''
