This is a new version of `` Ne me quitte pas , '' which was originally a vocal and piano piece from Spektor 's 2002 album Songs .
The updated tune was programmed by Pop and Hip-Hop producer Mike Elizondo , who worked with Spektor on several tracks on her 2009 album Far .
`` The imagery she uses lends itself to having a lot of fun in the studio with the arrangements , '' he told American Songwriter magazine .
`` She 's unbelievable in terms of her vocals and her musicality .
She can do anything , which enables you as a producer to do anything .
You 're like a kid in a candy store . ''
The song 's Gil Norton directed music video finds Spektor in a fancy apartment , playing around in a series of shots .
The What We Saw From The Cheap Seats makeover features the addition of steel drums and trombone .
Spektor told UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph : `` When I was hanging out with Nikolai -LSB- Fraiture , the Strokes ' bassist -RSB- and his kids , I totally realised my dream for that song is for it to become a limbo anthem .
I would just be in the dreamiest of realities if children would play it at parties and limbo down . ''
