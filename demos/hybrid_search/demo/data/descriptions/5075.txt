According to Thomas Hischak in The Tin Pan Alley Song Encyclopedia , the 1935 jazz number `` The Music Goes Round And Around '' is `` arguably the most successful nonsense song in the history of Tin Pan Alley '' .
It is about the operation of a French horn .
Written by Ed Farley and Mike Riley with lyrics by Red Hodgson , it was introduced by Riley and Farley 's band at a New York night club .
In one month it sold over two million copies of the sheet music ; at one point , four companies were printing it .
Many people have recorded the song , most notably Ella Fitzgerald ; it was also done as a duet by Danny Kaye and Susan Gordon in the 1959 film The Five Pennies .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England -RRB- Though this novelty song 's lyric is about playing the French horn , the song can be used for any instrument .
Tommy Dorsey 's hit version in 1936 did just that , with singer Edythe Wright joking around with the various soloists and then the whole band sings along with the chorus .
