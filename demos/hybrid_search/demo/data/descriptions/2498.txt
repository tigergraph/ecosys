Mitchell -LRB- from a 1996 interview with the Los Angeles Times -RRB- : `` I wrote the album while traveling cross-country by myself and there is this restless feeling throughout it ... the sweet loneliness of solitary travel .
In this song , I was thinking of Amelia Earhart and addressing it from one solo pilot to another , sort of reflecting on the cost of being a woman and having something you must do . ''
