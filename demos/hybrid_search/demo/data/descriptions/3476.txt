This righteous ear-bleeder is the opening track from Until We Have Faces , the third album by Christian rock band Red .
Guitarist Anthony Armstrong expounded on the song in an interview with Noisecreep : `` It 's us pointing a sarcastic finger at ourselves and at the people that have let the world define them , '' he said .
`` It 's this ` give up , give up , you 've already fed the machine ' - all those things in the world that are negative , all those things that do n't have any effect on us that can be inspiring . ''
By the song 's middle , the shout becomes `` wake up , wake up , and kill the machine . ''
Armstrong told Noisecreep at this point that the message is clear .
`` Throw everything you 've got down and realize you do n't have a face , you 're not your own person .
You have n't defined yourself . ''
