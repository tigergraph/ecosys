Vocalist Rou Reynolds discussed this song with Kerrang !
May 2 , 2009 : `` Days in the past are always perceived as perfect .
Having a good time with mates .
We 've had the riffs for a few years and everytime I hear it , it takes me back to time we all spent together , drinking cider in the park .
This song is a breath of fresh air from all the political lyrics . ''
