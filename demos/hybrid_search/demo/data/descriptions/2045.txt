Chvrches are a Scottish Electropop band consisting of lead singer Lauren Mayberry , guitarist Iain Cook and keyboardist Martin Doherty .
The band name has no religious connotation and they inserted a Roman `` v '' in order to avoid confusion with actual churches on internet searches .
Mayberry told NME regarding the song 's bitter and violent imagery : `` We 're not really in the business of writing summery pop songs .
They 're great when you get a good one , but I 'd never want to write ` La la la , I love you ' pop songs . ''
On the face of it , Mayberry appears to be taking aim at a former lover : `` You had better run from me With everything you own Cause I am gon na come for you With all that I have I am gon na break you down To tiny , tiny parts '' However the Scottish singer denied this is the case .
`` A lot of people think ` Gun ' is about a relationship , but it 's not , '' she told Consequence of Sound .
`` But I think that 's the great thing about it .
What they meant to me is n't what they 'll mean to all when they hear them . ''
