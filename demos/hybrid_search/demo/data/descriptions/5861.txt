Relient K lead Singer Matt Thiessen explained in our interview that he 's a very playful guy with a strong sense of humor and that , one way or another , this creeps into many of his songs .
`` Sadie Hawkins Dance '' is a stellar example of this , turning a somewhat clich√© situation -LRB- finding a date to a dance in high school -RRB- on its head , peppering it with jokes and absurd situations.Traditionally , a Sadie Hawkins dance is one where the girl is encouraged to ask the boy to the dance .
This is reflected in the line `` Girls ask for guys , it 's always a surprise .
`` Sadie Hawkins day was the creation of the cartoonist Al Capp , who described it in the 1930s in his comic strip Li'l Abner .
The concept of girls pursuing guys on this special day spread to high schools and colleges , and the dances started cropping up .
This song was released on The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek , the band 's second album , in 2001 .
It cemented the band 's reputation for having cheery music and enjoyable lyrics filled with humor , pop culture references , and Christian undertones .
The record went gold with over 500,000 copies sold .
This song was also originally supposed to have a music video .
However , as Matt Thiessen stated on the band 's forums , they did n't have a large enough budget to shoot the video that they wanted .
He also revealed that one plan for the video involved the actor Gary Coleman .
The song is about a nameless high school narrator 's humorous experiences while trying to find a date to the upcoming Sadie Hawkins Dance .
The lyrics suggest that it might be an autobiographical song , as the narrator acknowledges a sense of humor as prominent as Thiessen 's own with lines like `` Told a funny joke got the whole class laughing , think I got a tan from the light which I was basking . ''
The song appeared on an episode of the TV show Smallville .
