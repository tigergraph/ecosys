Scotty discussed this Chris Destefano , Jess Cates and Craig Wiseman penned tune : `` A fun one , a nice up-tempo with a dancing feel .
It has a cool little beat .
It talks about all the great things that happen in life - first kiss , first crush , first time I saw the ocean - and your love is better than that .
It 's a cool way of saying I love you and not just in a clich√©d way . ''
Scotty thinks this is his father 's favorite track on Clear As Day .
He told Billboard magazine : `` He 's always listening to this one when he goes running and stuff . ''
