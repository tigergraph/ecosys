This song finds Weller cataloguing a series of observations about the Afghan war .
It is titled after the private music studio of the German electronic music band Kraftwerk .
The recording production facility , whose name is taken from the first track on the Kraftwerk 2 , began as an empty room in a workshop premises located at Mintropstrasse 16 in Düsseldorf .
As the band became successful , other adjoining rooms were utilized as well .
In mid-2009 it was relocated to a new location in Meerbusch-Osterath , around 10 kilometers west of Düsseldorf .
Weller told NME about the song 's political slant : `` It 's about our indifference to the troubles in the Middle East .
It 's been dragging on for 10 years now and I do n't think most people know what we 're doing there really .
You always hear the government saying we 're liberating people over there but that 's nonsense .
Look at Syria now - I saw some guy on the news saying no-one will help us because we have n't got oil and our blood is n't worth anything .
This thing with Russia and China blocking the UN vote to help them was f -- ing shocking and it shows how ineffectual the UN is .
The whole situation in the Middle East , I ca n't see an end to that . ''
