In this song , lead singer Lacey Mosley sings about being shoved into the spotlight of God 's glory ; everyone thinks she 's so great , amazing , and bright , where really she 's just a faded copy .
In this song , Lacey is trying to express that she is n't nearly as great as God , even though she spreads his word : she 's simply telling about him , and that she 'll show you what he 's done , but she wo n't take credit for it .
