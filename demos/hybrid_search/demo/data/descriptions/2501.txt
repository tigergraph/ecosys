Against All Will is an American rock band comprising former Puddle Of Mudd co-founder and guitarist Jimmy Allen , -LRB- the co-writer of `` She Hates Me '' and `` Blurry '' -RRB- , vocalist Jeff Current -LRB- formerly with 7 Story Drop -RRB- , one time Soulfly bass player Cello Dias and drummer Steve Wilson .
Jimmy Allen told AntiMusic about this song : `` The song ` The Drug I Need ' is about a relationship that had gone bad but I could n't seem to quit seeing this girl .
She was like a drug .
I knew the girl was a mess from the start and it was n't going anywhere ... but I was so addicted to this girl and her issues and drama that always seemed to follow her in life.When it did finally come to an end , it felt like I was getting clean and sober .
-LRB- We both know you ca n't hate something you 've never loved -RRB- this was the last song we recorded in Korn 's Hollywood studio while working on the Rhyme & Reason record .
It really took on it own life after that .
It 's one of my favorites to play live .
That song is my therapy . ''
