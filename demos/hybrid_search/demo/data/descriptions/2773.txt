This was Country music singer Josh Thompson 's debut single and served as the lead-off single to his first album , Way Out Here .
Ken Johnson and Andi Zack penned the song with Thompson , which peaked at # 17 on the Country chart .
Thompson told The Boot the story of the song : `` This song was written roughly about three years ago .
I got together with my buddies Ken and Andi .
At that time , we had an standing Tuesday writing appointment at 6:00 PM , so we would get together and have some drinks and see what we could come up with that day.That day , we had this idea .
In about three hours , we had what we thought was a cool song .
We put it away for a little while , and then we brought it back out two or three weeks later .
It kind of hit us all funny that time .
We fixed a couple of more things and took it to the studio .
When we heard it with a full track behind it , we fell in love with it .
I feel like a lot of people can relate to it , yet it 's kind of a rockin ' song .
It 's a little bit on the goofy side , which is a great introduction to me .
There 's plenty of time for me to get deep ! ''
