For her debut album , Clare Maguire sought a single co-writer to ensure a cohesive sound , and found him in Fraser T Smith , a producer best known for his collaborations with the likes of Taio Cruz , Tinchy Stryder and Pixie Lott .
This was the first song they wrote together , which set the direction for the record .
She told The Independent : `` I knew what I wanted from the record and he was open towards it .
I could see it as a whole album and he had n't done one before , so it worked for both of us at the right time . ''
