Spandau Ballet 's chart career appeared to have stagnated after some initial success .
However , the Trevor Horn produced `` Instinction '' returned them to the UK Top 10 and this follow-up introduced the sound that would make them worldwide stars .
Saxophonist/guitarist Steve Norman recalled to The Mail on Sunday March 13 , 2011 : `` We knew we could n't stay an underground band forever -- the mainstream pop charts beckoned and we knew we had to deliver .
Cue smiles and kisses to camera!There was a blue-eyed soul element that we were looking for .
Lifeline dipped our toe in that water and was an important moment .
It set the sound for the True album , the sound that really catapulted us into global stardom . ''
