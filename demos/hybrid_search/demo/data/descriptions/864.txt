This was written by Rockabilly legend Carl Perkins , who was a member of Johnny Cash 's traveling show at the time .
Perkins wrote it about the sing-a-longs that many families in the Bible Belt would have after a hard day 's work .
He received permission from the Carter family to use the refrain of `` Will The Circle Be Unbroken '' and incorporated it into the song .
The other voices on the recording are June Carter Cash and the Statler Brothers , who were also members of Cash 's traveling show .
This song was # 1 on the country charts for 6 weeks in early 1969 .
