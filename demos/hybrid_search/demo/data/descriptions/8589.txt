Much of Resolution finds frontman Randy Blythe spitting bile at the failings of society and this sing in particular finds him expressing his abhorrence at the state of the world today .
He explained to Kerrang magazine why he is so angry : `` Society is fragmenting rapidly and the gap between the have and have nots is growing .
Humans in the Western World are losing the sense of what it is to be a person because everybody 's existing on little mobile devices or on computer screens .
I 'm not a Luddite but people are forgetting what it 's like to experience real life .
Mostly , what I 'd like people to get from this album is the inclination to think for themselves . ''
