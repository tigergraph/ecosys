This song starts with the sound of explosions in the background , indicating it is about a soldier at war .
He is sending letters and communicating with his mother , who seems ashamed of him : `` You ai n't no son of mine , for what you 've done they 're gon na finda place for you , and just you mind your manners when you go .
And when you go , do n't return to me , my love . ''
The soldier also feels shame , and is worried that he will be sent to hell when he dies .
