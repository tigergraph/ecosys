Grant co-wrote this acoustic rock track , which acknowledges that trials and tribulations happen to all of us , with Ian Fitchuk and Justin Loucks .
The singer explained in press materials how she hooked with her collaborators : `` Mindy Smith asked me to sing a background part on her latest record and they were producing it .
They already had the idea for the verses and I wrote the chorus and we wrote the last verse together .
It 's been hard times on a lot of levels for a lot of people .
I do n't know anybody that is saying this is the easiest and best time in life . ''
