Morrison lost his father , Paul , in August 2010 after a longstanding battle with alcoholism .
They had a difficult relationship , but this song evolved out of a poem he wrote after the last time he spoke with his dying dad .
Said the singer : `` He was n't very well before he died , and we were talking about things he should have done , or things I should have done .
It span me out , and I was like , I need to write about this because I 'm going crazy . ''
