This girl-power anthem features New York rapper Nicki Minaj , who also wrote the track .
Rihanna discussed her collaboration with the MC in an interview with UK radio station 95.8 Capital FM : `` You know , I worked with her before on -LSB- 2009 's -RSB- Rated R , and she was just writing me some really good ballads , and I could n't wait to work with her again and finally have her on my record .
`` Rihanna continued : `` I 'm really amazed that she can write like that .
-LSB- Nicki -RSB- not only raps but she can write songs too .
It was really easy actually .
We were going back and forth with the texts on how we were going to get to do it because we were in two different places and had two opposite schedules . ''
The song 's chorus plays on the children 's counting song `` Eeny , meeny , miny , moe , '' which dates from the 1850s .
Sean Kingston and Justin Bieber also utilized the rhyme in their hit `` Eenie Meenie . ''
During an interview with DJ Semtax on BBC 's radio station 1Xtra , Minaj explained why she ends her rap with a controversial line .
`` I just wanted to be crazy , I wrote that track in bed actually .
I had an off day , they sent me a record and said they needed it back in 24 hours and I wrote saying craziness , '' she said .
`` I wanted to make it more melodic and crazy .
On the last line of ` Raining Men ' I say ` It 's raining men , fat bitches . '
I just said it and I could n't take it back .
Then when I was at Yankee Stadium , I ran into -LSB- Island Def Jam Music Group Chairman -RSB- L.A. Reid and he repeated that line back to me .
And I was like ` Did L.A. Reid just say ` fat bitches ? '
I wanted to pass out . ''
Rihanna told Entertainment Weekly about the song 's meaning .
She explained it is , `` about how if things do n't work out with one guy , there are always many more other guys out there . ''
This is not the first song in which there is a precipitation of fellas .
The Weather Girls had a hit in 1988 with `` It 's Raining Men . ''
The tune was revived 13 years later by former Spice Girl , Geri Halliwell , for the soundtrack of the movie Bridget Jones ' Diary .
