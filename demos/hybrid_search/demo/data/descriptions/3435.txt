Frontman Rou Reynolds -LRB- from Kerrang ! -RRB-
: `` Musically , it has a beat that you would n't normally hear from a band like us .
It has some really delicate vocals , too and it 's pretty melodic .
It 's about how culture has diluted and ruined art . ''
Reynolds expanded on the song 's meaning to Alternative Press : `` Despite its tranquil-sounding intro this is actually a track full of frustration about modern music .
It 's a reaction to being surrounded by unprogressive , soulless , pointless , homogenised music .
It was written after touring with so many bands that sound the same and listening to radio where the music is just mind-numbing and soul-destroying in equal measures . ''
