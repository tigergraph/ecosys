Out Red Light Company frontman Richard Frenneaux explained this track to Clash Magazine : `` I had a childhood friend who committed suicide .
He folded his clothes up neatly by the side of a lake , overdosed on sleeping pills , then just walked in .
The song is based around a letter you would write , if you could still communicate with them , covering the denial as well as acceptance of their departure and loss .
The little toy soldier line is a reminder of youth , and the fact that we were still so young . ''
