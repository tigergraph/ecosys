The A.V.Club asked Neko Case if any of the songs on Middle Cyclone are autobiographical .
She replied : `` I know that I 'm in a lot of them .
I do n't think they 're really about me , necessarily , or about anyone in particular -- maybe `` Next Time You Say Forever '' a little bit .
But there are n't particular stories about other people , and the love songs are n't songs about me being in love with people , necessarily .
They 're more songs that are love songs between a tornado and a person .
But my own experiences are in there .
I ca n't deny that , because mine 's the only experience I have , so I do n't have any choice .
That 's all I got ! ''
