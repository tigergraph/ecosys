Chloroform is a slightly hazardous organic compound with an acrid , sickly sweet smell and taste , which sends people off to sleep .
The Scottish obstetrician , Dr. James Simpson , discovered its anesthetic properties in 1847 during an experiment with friends .
The first baby to be delivered by chloroform was one Wilhelmina Carstairs , however it was only when Queen Victoria allowed herself to be chloroformed by Dr. John Snow to diminish the pains of childbirth when giving birth to her seventh child , Prince Leopold , that it became an established anesthetic .
We recommend that you do n't use chloroform at home as it does does cause some unwanted side effects .
After waking , chloroformed patients often suffer from dizziness , brutal headaches , and bouts of vomiting .
Phoenix vocalist Thomas Mars is singing on this slinky ballad of a cruel , toxic love with the numbing properties of chloroform .
The pastoral , dreamlike performance video was directed by Mars ' film-maker wife , Sophia Coppola -LRB- Lost In Translation , The Virgin Suicides -RRB- .
Speaking about the clip , Coppola explained : `` I wanted it to be a fantasy of young girls fixated on a band they love and try to capture that feeling I remember of seeing bands when I was a kid , when you could totally lose it ... and to play up the band as close but out of reach .
It 's a fantasy audience , all young , pretty girls . ''
