Sheryl Crow told about.com about this song : `` You know , part of what amazes me is that we 're in a war based on , basically , oil ownership .
We 're very tied to oil , we 're tied to coal .
In the '60s and '70s when the Vietnam War was going on , every single day you saw people out on the streets rebelling , revolting .
You do n't see that now .
You hear about people trying to change the way they live and not become oil-dependent , but the bottom line is that the government has made it so that we are dependent on oil .
The kids are going over there and fighting for this idea of democracy , when really it 's all about oil , about oil ownership .
So the song was really inspired by that , acknowledging that things are not as they appear .
And what if we do wake up and become enraged , and we did take it to the streets ?
It 's kind of a sci-fi story looking back on a future when people actually demanded that our oil dependency come to an end . ''
