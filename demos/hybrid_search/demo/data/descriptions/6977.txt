This is a track from American alternative rock band Third Eye Blind 's fourth studio album , Ursa Major .
Frontman Stephan Jenkins explained to Alternative Addiction : `` Sharp-knife is about guiltlessness , you know when people do n't care about saying things ; they just cut through feelings like a knife , not worrying about what other people think .
Sometimes I 'm like that and others I 'm a bit of a wreck . ''
