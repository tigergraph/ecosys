This Country rocker was released as the fourth single from Jake Owen 's third studio album , Barefoot Blue Jean Night .
The song finds Owen singing of someone so in love with his girl he is happy to go anywhere as long as he is by her side .
The romantic tune was written by Nashville songwriters Ben Hayslip -LRB- Blake Shelton 's `` All About Tonight '' -RRB- , Jimmy Yeary -LRB- Rascal Flatt 's `` Why Wait '' -RRB- and David Lee Murphy -LRB- Thompson Square 's `` Are You Gon na Kiss Me Or Not '' -RRB- .
Some people queried the lyric , `` I 'll go anywhere .
West Virginia baby , I do n't care . ''
Owen told Country Weekly : `` I never thought twice about that when we recorded it .
I 've had people say , ` Oh , you do n't even care if you have to go to West Virginia , huh ?
Is it that bad ? '
I 'm like , ` You are reading way too much into this ! '
This song just felt good and I wanted to play it in my truck , drive around and sing it for the rest of my life .
There 's nothing against double-wides or West Virginia .
If that 's where she wants to go , that 's where we 're going ! ''
