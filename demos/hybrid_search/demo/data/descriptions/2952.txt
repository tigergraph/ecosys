Ben Howard closes his debut album , Every Kingdom , with this track on which he declares `` winter shall howl at the walls , '' one of several references to the colder seasons .
Speaking to Spinner , Howard admitted to a fondness for the bleaker times of the year .
`` I think I like the autumn , because it 's kind of ominous .
Winter 's just behind it , but everything 's sleepier and it 's quite cool , but you know everything 's going to get dark real soon , '' he mused .
`` There 's definitely something looming on the whole record , '' Howard continued .
`` But it 's not a depressing record .
In places , it 's definitely melancholic .
A lot of time and thought went into it , so there 's some songs that are pensive , but hopefully it 's obviously not too downbeat .
I try to paint a positive spin on stuff . ''
