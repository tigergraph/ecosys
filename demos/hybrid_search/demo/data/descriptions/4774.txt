This track has a Hip-Hop element .
Singer Ezra Koenig told NME : `` It 's a sample from a -LRB- rapper -RRB- YZ song , and I came to know his lyrics through a Souls Of Mischief song called ` Step To My Girl ' -- and the melody they sampled is from a '70s song called ' Aubrey ' by Bread . ''
Batmanglij told NME : `` That song is about people who can be possessive over music they love , and it 's also about other songs . ''
Rapper Danny Brown featured on a remix of this song .
He told NME about the collaboration : `` I 've been a fan of theirs for a nice length of time now , '' he said .
`` I 'm always talking about them - maybe they got wind of it !
It was all done over email .
I met Ezra at A-Trak 's house for a Christmas party one time .
Were cool ! ''
The song concludes with a low-pitch vocal similar to that of New York MC A$ AP Rocky .
Digital Spy asked guitarist/keyboardist Rostam Batmanglij if it was inspired by the rapper ?
He replied : `` We 've worked on music for a long time together and we 've experimented with pitching down vocals a bunch .
It 's not something that 's inspired us recently ; we 've done it for ten years , if you could dig up all our experiments together !
`` Asked if this meant Vampire Weekend were A$ AP Rocky before he was , Batmanglij laughed and continued : `` Yeah .
That 's not to say he does n't bring his own style and courage to the way he does it .
I think he 's pushing boundaries with the extent to which he 's doing it .
But yeah , it 's nothing new . ''
Koenig told the story of the song to MTV News : `` That song started through this Souls of Mischief rarity , called ` Step To My Girl ; ' I discovered it and I really liked the line ` Every time I see you in the world .
You always step to my girl , ' so I found myself writing some other melodies and lyrics , writing this other song inspired by it , '' he explained .
`` And then Rostam cooked up these harpsichord parts , these new harmonic identities for it .
And then we went backwards , and we had to find out who wrote that line , it got even more interesting , because it turns out Souls of Mischief did n't write that line , that actually came from this other guy , YZ ... so it was kind of perfect , because that 's how everything is , throughout time , ideas take on new forms .
