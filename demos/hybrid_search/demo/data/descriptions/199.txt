Released as the B-side of his first single `` Hey Joe , '' this was the first song Hendrix wrote for his band The Jimi Hendrix Experience .
According to Hendrix : Setting the Record Straight , Jimi did not write it willingly .
He wanted to use a cover of `` Land Of 1,000 Dances '' as the flip side to `` Hey Joe , '' but his producer Chas Chandler ordered him to sit down and write a new song , which he did that night .
Hendrix engineer and producer Eddie Kramer recalled to Toronto 's The Globe and Mail March 5 , 2010 : `` It was not only hard to play , because of its dynamic range , but it presented all kinds of difficulties in the studio . ''
By 1969 this declaration of independence had taken on new meaning thanks to the frustrations Hendrix felt about his management .
He recorded a new version with an old army buddy Billy Cox , replacing Noel Redding on bass .
This version can be heard on the 2010 Valleys of Neptune album .
John McDermott , a co-producer of Valleys of Neptune , explained to Musicradar.com why Hendrix felt the need to re-work this : `` With Jimi , it was all context .
Stone Free , he felt , was recorded too quickly , and it was never released in the States ; it was only issued as a B-side to Hey Joe outside the US .
As an American , it was an important song to him - it was the first song he wrote for the Experience .
So his attitude in 1969 was , ` OK , we 've played this live a bunch of times .
Now I can record this and really get it right . '
What happened then , of course , was that Reprise included the original version on Smash Hits in the US , so the '69 recording sat there ; the label thought it was unnecessary . ''
