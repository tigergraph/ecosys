This is the title track from American Country music singer Lee Brice 's sophomore album .
Brice said that this Billy Montana , John Ozier and Ben Glover penned song , `` sums up who I am in a serious way , but also in a cheeky way . ''
He explained : `` I 'm a real guy 's guy , and we 're insensitive at times , because we 're guys .
We 're hard to love .
I went on a writing retreat with some friends , and while I was in another room , three of them wrote this song for me .
When I heard it , I was like , ` You got ta be kidding me ! '
Because it was like I wrote it myself .
It 's hard to hear something you did n't write and love it so much .
But those guys know my heart . ''
The song was Brice 's second consecutive country # 1 following his debut chart-topper as a performer , `` A Woman Like You . ''
Lee Brice told reporters at a media event that the song has a universal message for men .
`` They were pointing it towards me and themselves , '' he said .
`` We 're the same kind of dudes , so it was easy to know that .
It really was . ''
Lee Brice first heard this when he was nearing the end of choosing tunes to record for his second album .
`` I 'm not the kind of guy that will put out stuff I hear every day ; it 's not all trucks and fields , and that 's not what I was looking for , '' he said , `` I was looking for something that meant something to me , and that song was the new picture of me . ''
