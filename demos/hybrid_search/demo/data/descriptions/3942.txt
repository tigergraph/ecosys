This song is about Bryan Glancey , the Mancunian musician and friend of Elbow who died suddenly in 2006 and was the subject of Seldom Seen Kid 's `` Friend of Ours . ''
`` It 's giving myself advice , '' said Frontman Guy Garvey to Q magazine . ''
` Do n't ponder these things that can potentially hurt you late at night . '
It 's literally , Do n't drink and think .
It 's another song about Bryan .
It 's a song about the friend I lost .
Because he 's still dead . ''
