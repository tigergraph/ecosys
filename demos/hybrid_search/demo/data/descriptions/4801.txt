Lyrically , the themes of This Addiction were influenced by the band 's personal lives .
Singer and guitarist Matt Skiba explained to Spinner UK : `` A couple of us have gone through some pretty serious life changes .
We had a good friend of ours pass away since the last record . ''
He added that in the case of this song , `` that was really influenced by the film Blue Velvet but it 's a metaphor for someone and something else .
Everything on the record is stuff that definitely hits close to home for us and we tried to communicate that in the songs . ''
