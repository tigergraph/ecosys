Furtado -LRB- from a press release to promote the album -RRB- : `` This plays around with the idea of wanting what you ca n't have , or wanting what 's on the other side , something you dream of .
And then you finally touch it , but , oh , no !
It 's too late ; it 's changed .
There are also themes of deception and mistrust , but I prefer to express that kind of world-weariness with a light touch .
The music has an understated hip-hop thing going on ; the groove just chugs along , with simple instrumentation . ''
