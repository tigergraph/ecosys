This heartfelt paean to a broken community finds Springsteen drawing upon Civil War imagery as he paints a picture of a town that 's been ravaged not by `` cannon ball '' or `` powder flash . ''
Instead , he blames the villainous bankers , or as Springsteen describes them , `` the robber barons . ''
`` They destroyed our families , factories , then they took our homes , '' Springsteen sings .
`` Send the robber barons straight to hell . ''
`` An outrageous theft occurred that struck to the heart of the American idea , '' suggested Springsteen at the unveiling of Wrecking Ball in Paris .
`` And there has been no accountability . ''
The Celtic-fuelled song finds the narrator describing the way the recession is destroying all he has ever known .
It serves as an update of Springsteen 's Born In The USA track , `` My Hometown . ''
Musically this is an Irish jig disguised as a Rock song .
Said Springsteen : `` I used a lot of music from the 1800s and the 1930s to show these things are cyclical .
The album is resonant with history . ''
