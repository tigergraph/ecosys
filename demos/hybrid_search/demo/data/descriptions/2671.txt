After signing with Big Beat Records in 1993 , New York singer-songwriter Robin Stone recorded this as her first single .
It became a massive international hit , going Top 10 both in America and the UK and also charting all over Europe .
The song has returned to the UK charts on several occasions .
In 1997 a re-mix by Lisa Marie reached # 9 , in 2002 a Tonka re-edit peaked at # 61 and in 2009 another re-mix , this time by Steve Angello & Laidback Luke returned the song to the UK charts yet again .
This song should not be confused with Swedish dance pop singer Robyn 's 1997-98 international hit of the same title .
The track is best known for its synthesizer riff , which dominates the mix .
Robin S 's follow-up single `` Luv 4 Luv '' used exactly the same formula and peaked at # 11 in the UK and # 52 in the US .
