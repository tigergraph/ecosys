This is the title track and lead single by Irish singer-songwriter and Girls Aloud member Nadine Coyle from her debut solo album .
The song received its official world premiere on In : Demand on September 10th .
The music video , directed by Wayne Isham , was filmed in Los Angeles , where Coyle re-located to prior to the recording of the album .
Coyle stated : `` It was so much fun making the video - even though I was sprayed with water and had a bad neck afterwards after all the hair flicking and rocking out I did ! ''
Co-written with former Robbie Williams songwriting partner Guy Chambers , Coyle told The Daily Mail that she knew this song was going to be a hit as soon as they finished the tune , because it was so catchy .
She said , '' ` I 'm a pop artist , and that 's what pop songs should do at their best .
I just knew we had something special when we wrote that song . ''
Coyle explained to Digital Spy how she hooked up with Guy Chambers : `` We were put in touch by my publishing company .
Before Girls Aloud I recorded songs on Garage Band , and it turned out that he 'd heard those songs .
To this day I still ca n't believe that my living room demos are out in circulation !
As soon as he asked me to work with him I was like , ` Guy Chambers ?
I 'll see you there !
2pm tomorrow OK ? '
I could n't believe it . ''
