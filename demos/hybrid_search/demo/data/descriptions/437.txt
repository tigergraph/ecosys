Latino Colby O'Donis has been recording music since the age of 9 .
O'Donis told Reload magazine about the song 's meaning : `` Its pretty much about a girl that got the world handed to her , and she keeps talking about it and I 'm like you do n't have to keep talking about it because you are so fly that we already see . ''
This features O'Donis music mentor Akon , who also produced the track and appears in its video .
In an interview with djbooth.net O'Donis discussed working with Akon : `` It 's crazy because , for one , with ` What You Got , ' the song , we actually did that on a studio bus in Canada .
It was on a bus , we were on the road , we were on the highway when we made ` What You Got . '
He did it in ten minutes , the whole song .
Like , literally , he made it so fast I was like , ` Wow ... ' He knocked it out like that .
Akon calls me his little prodigy , his secret weapon prodigy , he likes to call me that all the time .
He actually teaches me a lot . ''
Djbooth.net asked O'Donis whether any particular woman inspired this song .
The New York born singer replied : `` Pretty much on the record , it can be generalized .
I think everyone has experienced someone like that , that has everything , but wants more , and keeps talking about everything they got .
'Cause pretty much the song is about , like you said , that one girl that has everything - pretty much the world is handed to her .
And the thing is , she keeps talkin ' about it to everybody , ` Oh , I got this , and I 'm wearing Gucci shoes , I got this Gucci purse , ' and it 's all in plain sight , we can all see it .
So , pretty much , it could be generalized for guys and girls , because everyone knows someone that 's always talkin ' about what they got .
I think that 's why everyone loves it so much , because everyone can pretty much relate to it .
But it 's pretty much like it could be prioritized in that way . ''
