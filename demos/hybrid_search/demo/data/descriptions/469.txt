The first single and title track from Professor Green , real name Stephen Manderson , 's second album finds him poking fun at a couple of footballers .
His rhyme , `` Obnoxious preposterous loony a damn nutter/if I ever see Rooney anywhere near my grandmother ah ! ''
refers to Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney 's alleged affair with an older prostitute , whilst another rap - `` They want it with me like they want it with malaria / like Wayne Bridge wants John Terry 'd again '' - references Chelsea captain John Terry 's rumoured relationship with ex teammate Wayne Bridge 's former girlfriend and mother of his son , Vanessa Perroncel .
Manderson told Q magazine : `` The idea for the title came when I was on a video shoot for ` Coming to Get Me . '
There was a sign in the bathroom that said ` At Your Convenience ' .
I 'd had no sleep , I was tired , and I thought , You know what ?
Nah .
It 's not convenient for me .
I 'm not playing that game any more .
I 'm going to be a pain in the bum . ''
