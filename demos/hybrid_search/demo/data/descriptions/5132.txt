They included their unique renditions of Chris Brown 's `` Look At Me Now , '' Nicki Minaj 's `` Super Bass '' and LMFAO 's `` Party Rock Anthem '' .
After offers from various record companies , the duo signed with Sony and Epic Records in June 2011 .
Their first single `` Crash Your Party '' was released in October of that year 2011 and reached the top 40 in pop radio airplay .
The song was released on February 7 , 2012 .
Four days later the duo performed it on Saturday Night Live backed by a full group .
Heidemann sung-rapped her vocals dressed in 1940 's South Pacific-esque attire .
This cheery pop track is Karmin 's second single .

The pair collaborated on the track with Claude Kelly -LRB- Kelly Clarkson 's `` My Life Would Suck Without You , '' Jessie J 's Price Tag '' -RRB- and John Hill -LRB- Shakira 's `` She Wolf , Christina Aguilera 's Bionic -RRB- .
It was produced by dance-pop hitmaker Benny Blanco , whose resume includes Katy Perry 's `` I Kissed a Girl , '' Ke $ ha 's `` TiK ToK '' and Bruno Mars ' `` Grenade . ''
The song 's music video was filmed on location in Los Angeles and was choreographed by Richard Jackson , who is best known for working with Lady Gaga .
