Running to 5 minutes 11 seconds , this Phil Lynott composition is the opening track on the 1980 Chinatown album , and is as good as melodic rock comes : great lead vocal , great harmonies with overdubs of Phil 's voice , and the trademark Thin Lizzy duel lead with great riffs .
Altogether simply great.Chinatown was described by music pundit Greg Prato as a letdown , making it the first bad album in history made up of 9 good tracks .
