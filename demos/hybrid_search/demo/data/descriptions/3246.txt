This was the last song that Buckcherry wrote for Confessions .
Frontman Josh Todd told Classic Rock Revisited : `` We wanted a really great song that was mid-tempo but would rip your head off when it got to the chorus . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Daniel Gomez and is the first in Buckcherry 's career not to feature them in a performance environment .
The clip sees each band member personifying one of the seven deadly sins , the theme that inspired the album .
Gomez explained .
`` It opens in a roadside motel where there was a murder-suicide , and the video is the aftermath .
Our character comes back from the dead and walks into a tunnel that is the pathway to hell and ends up in an Alice In Wonderland-meets-Dante 's Inferno tea party where six of the seven deadly sins are having a party in the middle of the forest -- our interpretation of hell . ''
