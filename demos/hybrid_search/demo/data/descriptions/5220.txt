This is the title track and third single from former Trick Pony vocalist Heidi Newfield 's debut solo album .
Newfield told AOL 's The Boot about the song : '' ` What Am I Waiting For ' is an anthem with a really cool storyline .
I think everyone will be able to relate to it - men and women alike .
It 's about taking chances .
It 's about not biding your time and letting go of those things you do n't have control of and remembering that there is a plan for you .
It 's about following instincts .
If that means leaving a job that 's kind of your comfort zone to step into a job that perhaps is something you 've always wanted to do but it might be a bit of a sacrifice or a hard transition , then do it .
It 's about doing it because you do n't want to get old and look back in the mirror someday saying , ` Gosh , I wish I had the guts to do that . '
That 's what this song is all about .
The deep down story is that 's how I was feeling about my transition that I waned to make with Trick Pony and stepping out into my own .
Can I do it ?
It 's a song about having the guts to follow your dreams . ''
