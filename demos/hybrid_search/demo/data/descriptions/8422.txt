`` Bloody Well Right '' was Supertramp 's first charting hit in the US , while it failed to chart in the UK .
One theory on why the song did n't chart in their UK homeland has it that Brits were still offended by the adjective `` bloody '' in 1975 .
These days it is considered a mild expletive at best all around the world .
The song has a unique structure , with a 51-second piano solo at the start that meanders around , playing the `` Locomotive Breath '' trick of starting out vaguely recognizable and giving people plenty of time to guess who and which song this is before the more familiar parts kick in .
Then a grinding power guitar riff thunders by , making you think this is going to be heavy metal .
Nope , guess again - the light piano and suddenly chipper lyrics on the chorus take us back to pop rock .
Written by Supertramp leaders Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson , Davies sings lead on this one .
The song deals with youthful confusion , class warfare , and forced conformity in the British school system -LRB- kind of like Pink Floyd 's `` Another Brick In The Wall -LRB- part II -RRB- '' -RRB- .
This anti-establishment take was a theme of the album .
`` Bloody Well Right '' is actually an answer song to the previous song on the album , `` School . ''
Crime of the Century is a concept album that tells the story of Rudy .
In `` School , '' Rudy has lamented that the education system in England is teaching conformity above education -LRB- boy , Rudy , you should see America -RRB- .
In `` Bloody Well Right '' he joins a gang believing them to be the organized resistance that he longs for ; instead , they 're basically apathetic punks who mock him for his higher aspirations .
It 's not that Rudy 's wrong , it 's that Rudy is galvanized by something that is common knowledge to everyone else .
Hello , Occupy Wall Street ?
We have your theme song !
