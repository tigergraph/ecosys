On this track , Maxwell is pleading for somebody to `` wake up from your constant possum playing . ''
The singer told The Idolator that in this context the term `` playing possum '' means a dead relationship .
He explained : `` After you 've broken up with someone , you see the possibility of getting back together , but then the person is just laying there unable to .
It was my way of making a plea about having been aware of it being over .
-LSB- But -RSB- it 's kind of two-fold thing .
Sometimes , in my time away , it seemed that I was playing possum in terms of my work .
It 's symbolic for my career at the same time . ''
