This defiant track finds vocalist and lyricist Bethany Cosentino taking on anonymous online detractors .
She told NME : `` That song is about a difficult time I was going through with people saying stuff like , ' I just wish Bethany would write better lyrics , ' or ' I wish she would n't be such a stoner . '
People have said my lyrics sound like a 12-year-old 's diary , but that 's kind of the point !
I wanted to make music you did n't have to sit with and think , ` What the f -- k is this girl talking about , ' you know ?
And so -LRB- that song -RRB- is just me being like , ` Well , guess what , I do n't give a f -- k. ' ''
