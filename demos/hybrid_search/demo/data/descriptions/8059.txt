This is a track from American rock/pop band Boys Like Girls ' second album , Love Drunk .
Swift does not appear in the song 's music video , which was helmed by Irish music video , commercial , and feature film director Meiert Avis .
In 1988 Avis won a Grammy Award for his work on U2 's `` Where The Streets Have No Name '' promo .
This track features the Country-Pop artist Taylor Swift .
Frontman Martin Johnson told MTV News that the band were n't concerned about alienating their fans with this track .
He said : `` I do n't think we were worried about how our fans would react to that collaboration .
I think Taylor 's such a versatile artist , she can go from country to pop to rock to anywhere .
We just saw her at Madison Square Garden , and there were so many kinds of fans there .
We just thought she was the right voice and the right person for that song . ''
This is the first hit single that Taylor Swift was involved in as a featured rather than main artist .
