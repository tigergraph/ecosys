The title is a reference to Glinda , the good witch in The Wizard Of Oz .
The album Songs from an American Movie , Vol .
2 : Good Time for a Bad Attitude was hampered by being released only four months after its prequel , causing confusion amongst deejays and promoters , not to mention the buying public .
The previous album had gone platinum ; whereas part two has barely sold 100,000 copies .
North , East , and West , the 1939 The Wizard of Oz film does n't complete the bridge table of witches with the South .
But there is a Good Witch of the South , and in fact in the fiction canon of L. Frank Baum , her name is Glinda !
The Good Witch of the North is actually named Locasta or Tattypoo .
The film script combined the two , since the South was a powerful sorceress , whereas the North barely had a bit part in a couple of books .

Lead singer Art Alexakis wrote this for Stephanie , his girlfriend at the time who became his wife .

Since writing this song for his then-finance Stephanie , Art Alexakis has converted from atheism to Christianity .
He cautions , however , that he is not a Bible-thumper ; he just states that he uses it to improve his own life .
He has also identified himself as a `` left-wing Christian , '' and put a fine point on it with the later song `` Jesus Was a Democrat . ''
Come to think of it , how did the whole religion thing get so political in the US , anyway?Alexakis has also dabbled in acting , having made brief appearances in The Chris Isaak Show and Ned 's Declassified School Survival Guide .
