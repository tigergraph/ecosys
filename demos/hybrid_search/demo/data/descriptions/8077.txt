This track finds Trace celebrating the simple pleasures in life .
He explained to Reuters how the song was inspired by the view from his backyard deck , which overlooks a lake and the rolling hills of Middle Tennessee .
`` The song is very literal , especially that first verse , '' he said .
`` Kenny Beard and Casey Beathard came up to the house a year or so ago to write , and we were sitting on the deck talking .
The TV was on and some kind of depressing news came on and somebody said , ` We do n't need to listen to that on a day like this . '
We wrote the song in about 45 minutes . ''
