Marx claims he can never tell when a song is going to be a hit , and that if you 're trying to write a hit song , you have the wrong motivation .
Many of his favorite songs are his album cuts , and he cites this one as an example .
He told us : `` I had just experienced the first real loss of someone in my life , which was my grandmother .
I did n't have a relationship with my grandma like people do where you go visit your grandparents or you see them twice a year at the holidays or whatever .
I was raised by two working parents and so when I was little and I would come home from school , it was my grandmother that was in my house and took care of me and made me lunch and dinner a lot of times .
And then my mom and dad would end up at home either right around dinner time or in the evening .
So my grandmother was almost like a third parent .
We were really close .
And we were really good friends .
As I got older , we became really good friends .
We had a lot of common interests .
I just adored my grandmother.So she died about two years into my recording career , after I 'd had some success .
And so I wrote that song about her , about missing her .
My life had been so blessed in those terms up to that point , because I was 26 , 27 , and both my parents were still around , I had n't lost anybody .
And I took that loss really hard .
So that 's a song that means a lot to me that I 'm really proud of that resonates with me to this day that was never a single . ''
