Lead singer Jon Foreman explained to NewReleaseTuesday how musically this song was influenced by the music he played in his school years : `` I 'm pretty sure that I wrote this one in an elevator .
Tim -LRB- Foreman , bass -RRB- says that the seed of it was written by the time the elevator ride was over .
I do n't remember that , I just wanted to have a song on the record -LRB- and live -RRB- that captured a reinterpretation of the blues .
From the moment I started playing guitar I was hooked on Led Zeppelin , BB King , and Hendrix .
Wes Montgomery came later .
I wanted to have a simple throbbing , pulsing song on the record that epitomized the songs I played in Jr. .
High . ''
Foreman told NewReleaseTuesday : `` The concept of this song is fairly simple .
I am trapped by myself .
I am a man who is bounded by his own lusts and vices , yearning to be free of these hindrances .
We are enslaved to our passing desires that are often more swayed by our environment than our own volition .
Most of what we call our `` choices '' are simply reactions .
Free thought is incredibly rare .
Who can know the darkest parts within himself ?
This unspoken and nameless prison is the bane of the ` free ' world , the hole in the neighborhood .
We are in the chains of debt , the chains of consumption , enslaved by our lusts , our fears , and our past .
The truth will set you free but it 's only slightly less scary than hell and a whole lot harder to get there .
There is no outer freedom until we have chosen to be free inside.Lyrically I feel like this song is the brother of ` Mess of Me . '
Yearning for a life beyond what I have .
Hoping for freedom .
Still yearning to get there . '
I had a dream that my chains were broken ... broken open . '
I 'm still running hard for this goal . ''
