Coldplay 's first single from their fifth studio album was released digitally on June 3 , 2011 .
The release date coincided with the day the band 's summer festival run kicked off in Germany .
`` We 're about to play a bunch of summer festivals so it 's as good a time as any to put out a new song , '' said drummer Will Champion .
The song contains elements of `` I Go To Rio '' written by Peter Allen and Adrienne Anderson in 1976 .
Originally recorded for Allen 's fourth studio album , Taught By Experts , it was released as a single in Australia , spending five weeks at # 1 there .
In 1979 a cover by the pop rock band Pablo Cruise was a hit in the United States .
Chris Martin explained the song 's meaning in an interview with Music Week : `` The central theme of the record -- ` Paradise ' is kind of about this as well -- is trying to turn bad things into good things somehow .
We as a band have been through some funny incidents in terms of people being aggressive towards us or whatever .
And a lot of the record is fuelled by a kind of fire which comes from turning that negativity into positivity .
And I think everyone in their life has something like that . ''
Coldplay performed the new single for the first time during its gig at the Rock Im Park festival in Nuremberg , Germany on June 3 , 2011 .
Chris Martin was inspired to write the upbeat song after hearing the dance track `` Ritmo de la Noche '' by Lorca during a nightclub scene in Javier Bardem 's film Biutiful .
The track is based on `` I Go To Rio , '' hence Allen and Anderson credits as writers on this tune.Speaking to Mojo magazine Martin explained : `` There 's a scene -LRB- in Biutful -RRB- where he walks through a club , and I 'm thinking , ` This is the best chord sequence I 've ever heard !
I 've got to find out what it is and make a song out of it ! '
So I traced it back ... I used those two chords and got in touch with his people .
It felt very fresh - we 'd never sounded like that before . ''
