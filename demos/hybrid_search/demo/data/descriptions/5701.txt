This track features Busta Rhymes , as well as producer Oren Yoel 's band , New Kingdom .
Roth explained to MTV News that on this track , he wanted to let the beat do its thing , instead of trying to outshine it .
He explained : `` Sometimes the best way to handle a record is sort of getting out of the way . ''
The song 's title alludes to Roth 's astrological sign , which is Leo .
Though the middle class , ginger haired Roth does not conform to many hip-hop stereotypes , he is not adverse to some macho swaggering now and again , and this song is a celebration of his sexual prowess .
However the rapper told the London Times August 21 , 2009 the song 's sentiments do n't truly represent the real Asher Roth .
He said : `` I have girls throwing themselves at me .
But am I sleeping with these girls and catering to them ?
Absolutely not .
I 'm not attracted to any of that . ''
