The husband and wife duo Joey and Rory Feek wrote this song with Rory 's oldest daughter from his first marriage , Heidi Feek , who also wrote the track from their first album `` Tonight Cowboy You 're Mine '' with her dad .
Said Rory : `` I was a single dad of two young teenage girls when Joey and I met .
When we got married in the summer of 2002 .
In the ceremony , Joey gave rings to our girls too .
Engraved inside our rings are the last few words of our marriage vows ... `` bound by God forever .
`` Joey added : `` We believe that He knew we were meant to be together , that I really was born to be Rory 's woman and he was made to be my man .
This song 's very old-school .
We love that .
It seems like one of those timeless songs that could have been recorded years ago by Dolly & Porter or Loretta & Conway . ''
