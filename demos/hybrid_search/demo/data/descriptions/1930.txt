This song is about the town of Moab in Utah .
Oberst told MTV News : `` Moab is an amazing town .
I 'd heard about it and then actually I just drove out there by myself on a whim in between things , I wanted to check it out .
There 's this place , Arches National Park , out there , which has the big blown rock arches , and it 's really amazing . ''
The chorus of this song goes , `` There 's nothing that the road can not heal . ''
Oberst recalled to The Sun newspaper August 1 , 2008 : `` I went on a spontaneous non-musical trip and my car broke down there in Moab , Utah .
It 's been a while since I 've been stranded though it used to happen in the early days of touring .
It does n't so much these days with buses and everything so it was exciting to be stranded again . ''
