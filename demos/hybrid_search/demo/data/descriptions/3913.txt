Wale , -LRB- real name Olubowale Victor Akintimehin -RRB- , is an American rapper from Washington D.C. .
This was his second solo single release , though he 'd previously achieved some chart success in the UK as a guest artist on Australian white soul singer Daniel Merriweather 's UK top ten hit single `` Change . ''
Wale told MTV News that he 'd been trying to get Lady Gaga on board for several months as he felt she embodied the song 's party-record feel .
He said : `` If music was a high school , I feel like I 'll be the dude on the football team , and it would be like , ` OK , Gaga 's having a party ! '
And you know all the bad girls are going to be out there . ''
This samples Steam 's 1969 hit `` Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye . ''
This song features Lady Gaga .
Many expressed surprise that the D.C. MC was collaborating with the dance-pop princess .
Wale told MTV News that his goal was to go against the status quo of what a hip-hop track should sound like .
He explained `` Diddy , Kanye and Jay are always the first ones to do something , and I like to think of myself as the first person of the new class to kind of step out of the box .
It 's 2009 now .
Jay-Z is doing sold-out arenas with Kelly Clarkson .
It 's world music now .
I want ` Chillin ' ' to be a celebration of that . ''
It was Wale 's mentor , producer Mark Ronson , who originally sent Gaga the record .
She recalled to MTV News : `` I really wanted to sit down with Wale before I wrote the hook .
Because to me , it 's really lame when people send you tracks , and they 're like , ` All right , Gaga , throw your vocals on it . '
This is Wale 's record .
It 's not my record . ''
Wale told Digital Spy : `` It 's a fun summer song and that 's why I wanted to get involved with GaGa , because she 's just so carefree .
I wanted to make a record that was fun to listen to and I think we 've accomplished that . ''
