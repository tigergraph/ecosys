This song is named after Roger Waters ' father , Eric Fletcher Waters , who was killed in World War II when Roger was five months old .
The song is about Waters ' frustration with the leadership of the world since World War II , and him asking if this was what his father died for , that we might be just as well off with the Nazis ruling the world -LRB- `` Now the final solution can be applied '' -RRB- .
Waters ' father died in 1944 , and over the next few years , more and more men appeared in England as soldiers returned home .
For Roger , it was especially difficult , as his father never appeared .
Eric Waters ' body was never recovered , so Roger and his mother lived with the faint hope that he would someday return .
After The Final Cut , Waters left the band to pursue his solo career .
-LRB- thanks , Bill - Erie , PA , for all above -RRB- This song is a lot like the ones on The Wall and could have been one of those that did n't make `` the final cut '' to that album .
It has a similar sound , and mostly the same themes .
