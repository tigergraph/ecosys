This is frontman Ben Gibbard 's favorite song on the album .
Gibbard explained the song on his record label 's website : `` It 's a simple thought , really .
It 's a song about traveling by yourself in a foreign country and the frustration of being isolated by language , even when you 're surrounded by people . ''
