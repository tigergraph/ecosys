This song finds Paisley tipping his hat to surf guitar legend Dick Dale .
He told Billboard magazine the song takes a look at the past and , `` the way the '60s treated summertime , and country has become the format of beaches and summertime .
There 's not much of that on pop radio , like there is on country .
It was fun to expand on what I would sound like with the Beach Boys behind me . ''
