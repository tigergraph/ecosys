Patty Griffin 's American Kid album is dedicated to her father -LRB- a high school physics teacher -RRB- , Lawrence Joseph Griffin , who died in 2009 .
This song , which is both celebratory and mournful , describes him as `` such a scrappy guy '' .
She explained to UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph : `` He had the Irish fighter thing in him , although a lot of people knew him as this gentle , generous and very kind person , which he was .
He grew up in Boston at a time when the Irish were considered lower-class citizens , and I think that really had an effect on him . ''
This song was a tough one for Griffin to record .
Since it is not simply written about her father , but from his point of view , she says it seemed to be a bit more difficult to express what she wanted to say , so she put this song aside .
After every other track on the album was completed , she decided to give it another try .
Much of the album is done in a way that deals with death and loss , although this song is more about simply celebrating the life that her father lived , and letting her fans know about what kind of a guy he was .
The song also deals with her father 's return from fighting in World War II .
