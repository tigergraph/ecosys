Lead singer Stephan Jenkins explained on his website : `` The song ` God of Wine ' takes things from the cellular level , where it says , ` And soon cells give way . '
And then also it says , ` Every glamorous sunrise throws the planets out of line . '
The stars sent out of whack .
The universe is expanding and it 's crumbling .
The universe is mortal .
It 's disappearing .
Everything that we have , everything that we live in is pointless and crumbling .
And some people are born with an innate understanding of that .
They have this sort of life rage .
And this is the melancholy that they find themselves in .
It 's a song about those people .
And it 's basically a story about how we turn back to the Irish theme .
You turn to drink to escape that condition .
In the end of this song , talking about the God of Wine , the Bacchanalian , even that lets you down . ''
