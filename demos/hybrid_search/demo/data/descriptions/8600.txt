The lead single from Rizzle Kicks ' Roaring 20s album was penned by the duo with their producer Ant Whiting .
The fourth credited songwriter is Emily Phillips , who also co-wrote four tracks on the pair 's debut album Stereo Typical including the single `` Traveller 's Chant . ''
The song was released on August 19 , 2013 via Republic Records .
The song 's music video was directed by Jamie Thraves -LRB- Radiohead and Coldplay -RRB- .
It finds the Rizzle Kicks pair returning home from a heavy night out , and references several reality TV programs , including The Jeremy Kyle Show , which is mentioned in the lyrics .
The clip was created with the help of 150 young people between the ages of 16-24 with budding make-up artists , directors and wardrobe designers all contributing .
Jordan `` Rizzle '' said : `` We want to give kids the kind of break we got .
There are so many talented young people across the UK who all too often do n't get the chance to prove themselves in a real work environment . ''
The song finds Jordan `` Rizzle '' rapping about YouTube users paying to get more hits and quipping about Chelsea footballer John Terry 's ugly race row with QPR defender Anton Ferdinand .
`` When I heard people buy views , I was more confused than all John Terry 's black friends . ''
Terry was accused of using racially abusive language towards Ferdinand during a QPR v Chelsea match .
The former England skipper was given a four-game ban and a # 220,000 fine by the football authorities but was later acquitted in a criminal trial .
The song finds Rizzle Kicks getting opinionated about several different celebrities .
Jordan told Digital Spy : `` It is controversial , but we wanted to come back with lyrics that actually say something .
It 's the last song we made for the record , and we made it with the intention of it being the first single .
We 're coming back after months and months of dance music and we did n't want people to think we were coming back with gimmicks . ''
