Speaking with AUX Magazine about Dave ` Avey Tare ' Portner 's lyrics for this track , Josh `` Deakin '' Dibb said : `` I wonder whether Dave would disagree , because we definitely do n't always discuss like , ` what do you mean , man ?
What does this line mean ? '
But I know that in ` Amanita , ' he definitely talked , and we 've all thought a lot about it over the years , about the potential for good connection in more natural or traditional wisdom . ''
`` For me , not knowing what goes in to every lyric , '' he continued , `` I can step out of it and just be a fan .
I can trip out on the lyrics in the same way I do with a band that I do n't know . ''
The song 's title does n't appear in the lyrics .
However some reviewers have speculated that the opening lines , `` What will happen to the stories from the bogs ?
The trails of the Vikings ? ''
are a reference to the legend that the Vikings used Amanita Muscaria mushrooms to produce their berserker rages before battle .
