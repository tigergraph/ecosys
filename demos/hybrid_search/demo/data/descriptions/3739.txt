This Gospel-tinged ballad features Kelis singing about the time when she doubted herself , thereby revealing her vulnerable side .
In 2009 Cheryl Cole was accused by fans of ripping off this song 's melody for her debut solo single , `` Fight For This Love . ''
The song features Cee Lo of Gnarls Barkley , who also co-wrote the track with Kelis .
It is him doing the `` No , really , you 're great ! ''
part in the chorus .
