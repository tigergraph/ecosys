Lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong wrote this for a girl he met when the band was on tour in Japan .
He remembered her name because of how unusual it was and wrote a song about her .
-LRB- thanks , Katie - Berkly , CA -RRB- This song was written in Green Day 's early days and was going to be put on the album Kerplunk ! .
The band did n't like the sound of it at the time , but later decided to put it on Nimrod .
