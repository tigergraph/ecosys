Singer/Guitarist Martin Johnson of Boys Like Girls said : '' ` Broken Man ' is where the tide starts to turn a little bit in the record , back to the full circle recovery .
The song is obviously about heartbreak , but at the same time it is about moving on and pushing forward .
Even though I was broken from the circumstance , I was n't going to let it bring me down and I had to move on . ''
