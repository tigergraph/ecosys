This aching reflection on lost romance is the first single from New York-based indie-pop singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson 's fifth studio album , Human Again .
`` I 'm a ghost , haunting these halls , '' she sings .
`` Climbing up walls that I never knew were there . ''
The song was released on November 15 , 2011 .
The song is one of several dark tracks on Human Again , a surprise to those who think of Michaelson as a writer of cutesy love ditties .
`` The album is called ` Human Again ' because it 's taken me a very long time to be happy , '' explained Michaelson .
`` The music on this album might surprise some people .
I was really singing out , physically ; I was writing about a really dark time in my life . ''
