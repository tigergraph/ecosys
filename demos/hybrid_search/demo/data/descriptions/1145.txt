Little Big Town close their fifth studio album , Tornado , with this chilling track which the quartet wrote with Nashville songwriter Natalie Hemby .
It is one of five writing credits that Hemby has on the record .
The cooing chorus was achieved by the band singing into an echo chamber .
Phillip Sweet recalled : `` At the studio , there 's a little hole in the wall that you go through to the chamber , where there are microphones set up to catch the echo .
We all got inside to sing the ` who-o-oohs . ' ''
LBT 's Karen Fairchild recalled the writing of the song to The Boot : `` The title was Natalie 's .
It was the first day we had ever written with her and she came in with guns loaded , with lots of ideas .
It was really very flattering because she had listened to all the band 's records and she knew the history so much that she said , ' I want to write something with you guys that you 've never written before .
A style that you 've never written before . '
So we were like , ` Let 's do it ! '
We love creative exercises like that , exploring new avenues .
So the call-and-answer between the two duets of Kimberly and I and the guys is kind of an Everly Brothers homage .
It was something that we had never done . ''
