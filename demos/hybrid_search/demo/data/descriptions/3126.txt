Frontman Ben Kowalewicz discussed this song with Kerrang !
May 30 , 2009 `` I 'm 33 now and see a lot of people who 've become really complacent .
They work a job they do n't like .
They 're with a girl they do n't like .
They 're in an apartment they do n't like anything .
When you talk to them over a pint , they think they have no alternative .
They ca n't see a way out .
They 're too afraid to start afresh .
If people are stuck like that and do n't have the courage to change things for themselves , they 're going to be that 50-year-old who hates everything .
I 've never understood grumpy old men .
It 's about realizing-as tacky and clich√©d as it may sound-you only live once and once you 've experienced loss , things get put into perspective .
You have one opportunity , so live the best life you can without causing anyone harm .
Go for it .
If you do n't , well ... you 'll be 50 , you 'll be 60 then you 're dead .
I do n't want to ever think ' I wish ... ' on my deathbed .
I want to be satisfied and so far , I am . ''
