Speaking to Q magazine February 2014 , Callahan said that as the years have gone by he 's become , `` more interested in singing better and playing guitar better and the relationship between those two things , how they play off each other . ''
He added that this track that recounts the regret of a marriage ruined , is a fine example of his new outlook : `` It 's a song where the vocal and guitar are inter-related and dependent on each other , '' he said .
`` And that 's a very spare song , so it 's very obvious .
It reminds me of what I 'm trying to do . ''
