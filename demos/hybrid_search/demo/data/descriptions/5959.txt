Jake Owen explained during a preview of Barefoot Blue Jean Night to the media and label executives , that this philosophical acoustic ballad reminded him of his own grandpa .
He added that he was proud when producer Tony Brown suggested he play the guitar parts on the song in the studio , as it was the first time he had played on one of his own records .
Before recording this song for Barefoot Blue Jean Night , Owen had already been playing it for a while , just him sat on a barstool .
He told The Boot he decided to include it on the album , as he wanted something that sounded different without his usual backing band and he was `` flattered '' that they allowed him to do that .
Owen told Billboard magazine : '' ` Journey of Your Life ' is probably the best song I 've ever recorded , because for me my granddad is the rock of our family and he 's instilled a lot of really strong morals and values within myself and my family .
He 's really been the anchor of our family . ''
Owen told The Boot this song means a lot to him .
`` It 's just a song about life , '' he said .
`` I 've had a pretty awesome journey and an awesome mom and dad .
As rockin ' as my record is , this one song really identifies me . ''
The song finds Owen singing : `` You 'll need a hero / And a good dog / Especially a good dog . ''
Owen has `` two good dogs '' at home .
He told The Boot : `` Dogs keep you sane .
You can be mad and come home , and your dog will look at you and be like , ` All I want is a scratch on my head . '
There 's simple things in that song that were stated very simply , yet they 're very profound . ''
