This was the debut single for City High ; Robby Pardlo -LRB- b 1982 -RRB- , Claudette Ortiz -LRB- b. 1984 -RRB- , and Ryan Toby -LRB- b 1982 -RRB- all hailed from the New Jersey-Pennsylvania border city of Willingboro .
Ryan and Pardlo had worked as a duo until persuaded to recruit Ortiz by their mentor Wyclef Jean and his cousin Jerry Wonder .
Ryan explained on his record label 's website that Ortiz was signed to differentiate them from the recently signed male duo Product G&B : `` Clef , Jerry and our management thought that by adding a girl to the group it would make us even more distinct .
And since they had already signed the Product G&B we agreed .
Bringing Claudette in just made it all come together , all bases were covered . ''
Originally released in 1999 , a new mix that interpolated Dr. Dre 's `` The Next Episode '' into the bridge was released in 2001 and became a transatlantic Top 10 hit .
The original version featured in the 1999 film Life .
This is a morality tale of a woman living a hard-knock life who feels compelled to become a stripper to feed her child .
This contains a sample of Notorious B.I.G 's `` Things Done Changed . ''
