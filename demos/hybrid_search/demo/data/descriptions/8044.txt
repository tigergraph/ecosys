This old-school '80s rocker encapsulates Black Out The Sun 's themes of aging and the changing world .
Sevendust frontman Lajon Witherspoon explained in our 2013 interview : `` We were able to let go on this album , so we were n't afraid to write the softer song ` Got a Feeling , ' to a heavy song , 'Till Death . '
And I think it definitely reflects the age that we are and the things that we 've gone through in life .
The lyrics to ` Got a Feeling , ' I do n't think I 'll be happy until it 's completely over .
It 's a different way of saying , ` Hey , I 'm happy now , but I do n't think that we 'll honestly truly be happy , at least we 've been told , until we are in Heaven . '
So that 's just a little throwback on that . ''
