Vocalist Chris Robinson told Rolling Stone : `` It 's about freedom , and what revolution used to stand for , how you 've got to make one of your own and make it last .
It 's like the last line of the song , ` Do n't you want to see the ship go down with me ? ' ''
Warpaint was the Crowes first album for 7 years .
The band cut the songs live in the studio in just 3 weeks and in as few takes as possible , with minimal overdubbing .
Chris Robinson said that the album 's title signified `` the revolution that could take place in all our souls . ''
Chris Robinson added in an interview with The Black Crowes Bootleg Project : `` It 's a little bit cheeky that one .
The whole idea is the paranoid utopian blues .
We know it 's bad , we know they 've laid the trance on thick , but for those of us who can see through it we should run through the gates of the city and find ourselves in this place we want to live .
I think that 's the best sort of banner for the record to start under .
If people are wondering if this is a rock & roll record , this is a good example of where our hearts and minds are . ''
