The band said of this song on their MySpace site : `` This song is about that evolution of change .
For better or worse our country is n't the same as when we were younger .
When you grow up in America you 're taught in the public school system to be loyal and to love your country through reciting The Pledge of Allegiance .
In general , some of us covet it , or in some cases even rebel from it .
Sometimes you can feel close or far away from a place , family member or even your own home town .
It does n't mean you love it less or disrespect it by disagreeing with its current values and or views .
True patriots will stand for what they believe in , even if it goes against the grain .
We jammed this one acoustic after hours and it clicked almost immediately .
The way we play the chorus seems straightforward but there is a swing to it .
This keeps it moving but still manages to be rocking .
It reminds us of Woody Guthrie . ''
Drummer Branden Steineckert explained : `` We had the idea early on of having songs where each singer in the band takes a verse singing .
This is one of the first that we tried it on .
Lars sings the first verse , Matt second and Tim sings the third verse .
I had a little room in the bridge and last verse to throw in a few playful drum parts so I had fun with that .
The drums on the beginning of the last chorus were inspired by Sham 69 . ''
