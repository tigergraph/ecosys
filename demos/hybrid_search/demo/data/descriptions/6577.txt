Cullum explained this song : `` I 've been introducing it onstage as a disco song about the death of the music industry .
It 's a love song for the music geek in me .
The ultimate romantic act back-in-the-day used to be making a mixtape for a girl .
I decided the ultimate modern romantic act would be to get your tape player down from the attic and go out and find a Maxell C90 and record a mixtape .
It 's even more romantic now because of the technological rewind you have to do . ''
