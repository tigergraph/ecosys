This track was written by Shelton about his girlfriend Miranda Lambert 's pet dog and was inspired by the pooch 's singular loyalty to its mistress .
Shelton explained to Wendy Geller of Yahoo Music : `` The idea came to me when I was on the bus with Miranda , and she had to go into town to do something .
So I was watching her dog , Delilah , for her .
Delilah watched Miranda walk away and drive off .
Just kept watching .
I said , ` Come over here Delilah , I 'll pet you ' ... but she completely ignored me . ''
