TobyMac told Christianity Today the story behind this song : `` Anyone who is married knows the feeling of offending and lying in an ice cold bed yet sweating .
Sometimes our resolve to confess and seek forgiveness is more difficult to navigate than we can imagine .
This song sums up a typical ` post-stick my foot in my mouth ' moment . ''
