Plain White T 's were formed in Lombard , Illinois USA , in 1997 by a group of high school friends : vocalist and guitarist Tom Higgenson , bass player Ken Fletcher and drummer later rhythm guitarist Dave Tirio .
This song was the first ever written by Higgenson and Tirio together .
The singer told Alternative Press magazine : `` In 13 years of being in a band with each other , Dave -LSB- Tirio , guitar -RSB- and I had never attempted to write a song together .
This is our first try , and I think we might be onto something .
We wanted the song to be a party , and for the music to actually reflect the laidback vibe of the lyrics .
Dave plays the guitar solo , which is not technically great , but its rawness lifts the song to a higher place .
It does n't take itself too seriously , which is what the song is really all about . ''
