This Lee Brice , Lamar Alexander and Billy Montana penned song was inspired by a conversation Brice had with a Tennessee senator .
He recalled to The Frederick News-Post that the senator shared a story about an older couple he was talking to .
When asked how they were doing , they hooked arms and said , `` We 're falling apart together .
`` Enthused by the tale , Brice immediately saw potential for a song about folks around the country struggling during hard times and how we 're all falling apart together .
