A sweeping piano-dominated ballad -LRB- eerily like John Lennon 's `` Imagine '' -RRB- , Pour Le Monde -LRB- `` For the World '' -RRB- seems to be an anti-war/protest song but it 's vagueness and ambiguity allow personal interpretation in many ways .
This is typical of Neil Finn 's songwriting , creating a deeply personal connection with the listener .
Neil Finn , a man Sir Paul McCartney once said was the best songwriter in the world , came together with bassist Nick Seymour to record what was intended as his third solo album .
The sessions evolved into the makings of a fifth studio album - Time On Earth - for a reformed Crowded House with guitarist/keyboardist Mark Hart returning and new drummer Matt Sherrod -LRB- formerly with Beck -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , Stu - Suffern , NY , for above 2 -RRB-
