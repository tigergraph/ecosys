After signing a contract with Warner Bros , Laurie released a blues album , Let Them Talk , which proved a commercial success , topping the charts in several countries including Argentina and Austria .

This song was originally recorded in 1929 by Arthur `` Blind '' Blake , an influential ragtime blues singer and guitarist , who laid down about 80 tracks for Paramount Records between 1926 and 1932 .
Laurie 's version debuted at # 58 on the Hot 100 , taking the song into the singles chart for the first time 82 years after it was written .
The album pays homage to New Orleans blues , a type of music in which Laurie has immersed himself all his life .
He told Associated Press : `` I 'm approaching the source of this music that I 've loved all my life and I do so with trepidation and a lot of respect .
I hope people will believe and understand I 'm not being cavalier about it .
This is not a casual thing for me at all .
This is more important than almost anything I 've ever done . ''
