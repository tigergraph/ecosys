Guitarist Anand Wilder told the story of the song to MTV News : `` I was trying to explore the idea of a song that did n't just have one chord in it .
Because a lot of songs on the first album had maybe just one chord in it , or maybe just two chords .
Maybe we 'd go to three in the chorus .
So I created this really long riff that went on for about 16 bars and had chords that were changing along with the riff .
And then I had this idea about writing a song about addiction - alcoholism - but kind of relating it to a way you 'd get rid of a girlfriend or something .
So we worked on that song for many months Upstate , in Woodstock , and threw a big beat over it .
It became kind of like a early - '90s era Beck song , with a break beat over it .
And then when we brought it to the live setting , with our new bandmates , Chris -LSB- Keating , vocals and keyboards -RSB- kind of said , ` It 's not a dance song , ' and we were talking about how , on this album , we wanted to commit to certain styles for an entire song and not jump around .
So , finally , I caved in .
I only caved in after the Bonnaroo audience was so excited by our live version , and I was like , ` OK , I guess I lost that argument . ' ''
The song 's acronym title is taken from its first line , `` One 's Not Enough . ''
This was released as the second single from Odd Blood .
The original '90s dance sounding version of this song can be heard as the B-side .
