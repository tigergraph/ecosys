This was inspired by and based on the 1797 poem of the same name by Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge -LRB- 1772-1834 -RRB- , a contemporary of William Wordsworth and William Blake -LRB- whose work was the inspiration and basis of Bruce Dickinson 's solo album The Chemical Wedding -RRB- .
In the poem , the captain -LRB- The Ancient Mariner -RRB- tells the story of how his ship was driven south by storms and the strange happenings that followed .
The moral of the story is that `` we should love all creatures created by God . ''
