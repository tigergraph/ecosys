Vocalist Nathan Leone -LRB- from Rock Sound magazine -RRB- : `` This song 's about accepting yourself for the best and worst parts of you .
If you do n't accept yourself you 'll never be able to have a peaceful mind , relationship and/or life .
It came at a time where we were being judged left and right and had to fight through questions ourselves .
We had one of our best friends/crew dudes track the bridge which gave it a cool genre dynamic .
Thematically it 's another one of these broken down to your core and finding the strength in it . ''
