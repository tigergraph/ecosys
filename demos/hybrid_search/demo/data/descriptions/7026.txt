This propulsive rocker was written by Noel Gallagher .
He said on Oasis 's website : `` If ` The Shock of the Lightning ' sounds instant and compelling to you , it 's because it was written dead fast .
And recorded dead fast .
` The Shock of the Lightning ' basically is the demo .
And it has retained its energy .
And there 's a lot to be said for that , I think .
The first time you record something is always the best .
`` Guitarist Gem Archer added in an interview with Q magazine October 2008 : `` Noel literally just played it the night before -LSB- it was recorded -RSB- .
Did a little one-man-band job , played the drums , the bass , the guitar , sung it and came back up the stairs . ''
There is some noise that fades up at the end of this song .
If played backwards , it reveals Liam Gallagher singing `` Champagne Supernova . ''
