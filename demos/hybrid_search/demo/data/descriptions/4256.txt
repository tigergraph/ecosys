The theme of Buckcherry 's Confessions album is the seven deadly sins and four elements .
It is part of a larger vision that includes a short film written by vocalist Josh Todd , who based the lyrics on his childhood and transformation into adulthood .
He explained to Heavy Metal Artwork : '' ` Water ' and ` Air ' are about -- well there 's a love interest in the film -- it 's about these two opposite people and they 're struggling with the meeting of the two worlds , and how they 're going to deal with each other .
That 's where those songs came from . ''
