Arcade Fire wrote and recorded this track for the soundtrack of the movie The Hunger Games .
The song plays during the closing credits of the film and the Canadian band also contributed another piece of music titled `` Horn of Plenty '' to the film score .
Hunger Games has a storyline of a group of children sent on an annual battle to the death , which is screened live to the rest of the planet .
Arcade Fire frontman Win Butler told Entertainment Weekly how he attempted to channel the movie 's strong dystopian themes .
`` I tried to put myself in the headspace of how excited I 'd be if this film was coming out when I was 15 .
I still remember hearing Radiohead 's ` Exit Music -LRB- for a Film ' in -LSB- director Baz Luhrmann 's -RSB- Romeo + Juliet when I was that age .
`` Butler came up with the idea of using the account in Genesis of God ordering Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac in order to test his obedience as its framework .
He said : `` Our whole approach was to get into the world and try to create something that serves the story and the film .
There 's something in the story of Abraham and Isaac that I think resonates with the themes in the film , like sacrificing children .
So we made a weird , alternate-universe version of that , where it 's as if Abraham had a daughter -- kind of a metaphor for Katniss -LSB- the protagonist -RSB- . ''
