Blunt told The Metro that this song is about the English supermodel Kate Moss .
`` Yes , she is a dangerous woman , '' he said .
Failing to elaborate the singer cryptically teased ; `` It 's one of those na√Øve songs full of that teenage energy .
That excitement of having someone , that fear and the excitement of the unknown . ''
The phrase `` I 'll be wrapped around your finger '' is also used as the title of a Police song .
Blunt told Mike Ragnoga : `` It was n't supposed be a reference to that , but I guess that 's how music permeates through your mind .
On the song ` Dangerous , ' it feels like a teenager picking up a new instrument and writing something with all of that naive excitement . ''
This was the first song that Blunt wrote with Some Kind of Trouble producer Steve Robson .
During a conversation with Mike Ragnoga of Solar Powered KRUU-FM , Blunt explained how an initial get together led to the writing of an album .
`` That was the first song I wrote for this album .
I walked into this guy 's studio - Steve Robson .
I was supposed to just meet him for a beer , and I was n't quite sure at the time what I was doing musically .
I was just sort of hanging out with my friends and stepping out of the music scene .
Then , I walked in and picked up an electric guitar - which I had n't properly played in a long time - and we wrote this song together .
I asked after if I could come in tomorrow and record this and we did and it sounded great .
So , I came in the next day and wrote another .
The days turned into weeks which turned into months .
It turned into a year in the studio together .
I 'm sure his wife was extremely jealous from the amount of time we spent together , but the results came spontaneously . ''
