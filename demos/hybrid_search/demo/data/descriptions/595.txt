Justin Moore grew up in Poyen , Arkansas -LRB- Population : 272 -RRB- .
The small town southerner moved to Nashville after graduating from high school , and began writing songs .
Among the first that he penned was this love letter to Poyen .
Moore told The Washington Post , that he wrote the song when he was homesick `` and thinkin ' about missin ' home and mama 's cookin ' . ''
The song 's music video was shot in Poyen and features several generations of Moore 's family .
When this song topped the Country chart , Moore became the first solo male artist to take a track from a debut album to # 1 since Jason Aldean reached the summit three years previously with `` Why . ''

Justin Moore wrote this song with his frequent songwriting partners Brian Dean Maher and Jeremy Stover .
The threesome wrote several of the songs on Justin Moore and this was one of the first they penned together .
He recalled to Great American Country : `` I believe it was the first or second song the three of us had written together .
It was seven years ago .
I was just talking about missing home because I had only been here for six or eight months at the time .
I obviously did n't have anything going on really and I was like , ` Man , I feel like I 'm walking on quicksand here .
I just miss home and want to go home . '
Some of the songs you write you go , ` Eh , maybe it 's all right , ' and later you find out that it 's really cool .
That was one of those songs where I remember going , ` That 's a special song .
I think it can be a big song for us at some point . '
That 's the days you leave the writing room pretty happy . ''
This was the third Country # 1 song with `` USA '' in its title .
The previous two chart-toppers were Kitty Wells ' `` Heartbreak U.S.A. '' -LRB- 1961 -RRB- and Donna Fargo 's `` The Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A. '' -LRB- 1972 -RRB- .
