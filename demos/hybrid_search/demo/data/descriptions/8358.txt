We needed someone to take us to another level even though we 've had such huge success off our own backs.We feel confident to go it alone , but working with someone different is always a gamble .
For the first four months , if felt like we 'd f -- ked up , like we should have done everything on our own , but as time progressed , we could see what Don was doing and why he was doing it .
We 'll always be trying to show people what we 're capable of . ''
