R&B and soul singer-songwriter Lyfe Jennings steps in on this Dr. Dre-helmed number from Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon 's fourth solo album , Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II .
`` Catalina '' originally featured Busta Rhymes on the hook .
Reakwon explained to Artist Direct why he was replaced : `` Busta 's the one that put me and Dre together .
The first hook had a little reference from Busta Rhymes .
He was singing and having fun .
I liked his hook too , but we decided to change it because we do n't people to start thinking Busta 's a singer .
He 's not that kind of artist , plus he was having fun .
It was n't nothing that he was banking on doing .
We knew that record was going to the top . ''
Raekwon discussed the track with Artist Direct : '' ` Catalina ' was a vicious record , and we always knew that was going to be a hit .
I remember when I actually sat in the studio with Dr. Dre and he first played it for me .
I looked at his face and I could tell that he really loved the beat .
I loved it because it 's my kind of beat .
It was still hip hop , but it had savoir faire to it .
It reminded me of a new ` C.R.E.A.M. ' That 's why you hear me come with a similar style on it .
The beat was just knocking , and the first thing I thought about was one of those big yachts that said ` Catalina ' on it .
If you ride on this s -- t , you 've got to have money . ''
The song samples from the dialogue and score from the movie The Killer .
