This delicate slow-moving track is from Canadian rapper and singer Drake 's R&B mixtape , It 's Never Enough .
The song was produced by Noah `` 40 '' Shebib .
Drake sampled `` FanMail , '' the title track of R&B girl group TLC 's 1999 album , for this song .
He explained to MTV News that he lifted the vibe of the TLC cut to set up the feel of the mixtape .
He said : `` It 's a nod to a phenomenal group .
Not a lot of people booked it , but it 's like the fan-mail tribute to TLC . ''
Drake told MTV News that in spite of the adoration of women and girls everywhere , he still gets lonely .
`` I 'm envious of friends of mine that have great committed relationships , '' he explained .
`` When people call home to check on their girl or they say , ` I 'm not going to go out tonight .
I 'm just going to spend the night with my girl . '
That hits me , man .
I just do n't have that . ''
