This song/poem was written from the perspective of Jed The Humanoid , who is a character that appears earlier on the album .
As the story goes , Jed wrote the song just before he died .
He wrote it in his onboard language `` Apple BASIC . ''
In this song , Jed talks about his alcohol addiction , how he wandered about after being found of no use , and let down by his friends -LRB- users -RRB- .
It deals with his struggle , finding places to sleep , his favorite singer , his better past , and how he gradually sank into a deep hole of alcohol abuse.You can understand this song as about many people who fall into the same pit , as newer versions make them obsolete .
-LRB- thanks , Tom - A , Belgium , for above 2 -RRB-
