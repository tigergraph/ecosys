This uptempo dance jam is the first release from American R&B singer Janet Jackson 's eleventh studio album .
Grammy-winning producer Rodney `` Darkchild '' Jerkins helmed the song .
He also produced several tracks on Janet 's 2008 album Discipline .
He explained to MTV News : `` It 's about dancing .
It 's all about her .
It 's about -LSB- saying -RSB- , ` Listen , if you really want to get with me , you got ta make me feel a certain way . ' ''
This song is often called a tribute to Michael Jackson 's 1979 solo single `` Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough , '' but his sister Janet told Ryan Seacrest that was not her intention : `` It 's so funny how things are born because I say ` do n't stop , ' but I say ` do n't stop 'til you get it up . '
But everybody thinks I 'm saying ` get enough , ' but it 's a different melody .
But everyone , I guess because it 's the same lyric to a certain degree , they think it 's that , but no . ''
Jackson explained to The Sunday Times November 29 , 2009 why she recorded a song about partying : `` I think people want escapism right now , because there 's so much going on , '' she said .
`` There 's so much heartache , there 's so much pain , there 's so much death .
It 's a sad world right now . ''
