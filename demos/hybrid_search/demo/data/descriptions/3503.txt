This was the last song that Lindsey Sirling wrote for her self-titled debut album .
She recalled to Artist Direct : `` I was down to the wire , and I really wanted to have twelve songs .
What 's interesting about this album , and I see this as I 'm working on the new album , you create lots of ideas , and then you pick the best .
For this last album , I literally created twelve songs .
That 's all I had , and they all ended up on the final tracklisting . ''
`` It 's miraculous if you think about it .
I ended up liking every single song .
I used everything I had , '' Stirling continued . ''
` Stars Align ' came at the last minute .
At the last minute , I found a producer I liked .
I met with him and within four days we created this song .
That 's why I called it ` Stars Align , ' because at the time I thought , ' A miracle has to happen if I 'm going to have another song in five days . '
I felt like the stars aligned for me to finish the record .
That 's why there are twelve and it 's called ` Stars Align . ' ''
