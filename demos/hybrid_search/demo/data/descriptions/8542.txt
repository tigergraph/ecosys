This Flamenco/Rock crossover song tells the story of a serial womaniser , who finally meets his match .
Page 's recording featured the innovative multiple-voice technique with which she recorded most of her early hits , and White recorded the trumpet parts in much the same way Page recorded her vocals .
He located Regulo Aldama , a player in a Mariachi band at a Mexican restaurant near the Nashville studio where the Stripes were recording and White recorded him again and again .
He told USA Today : `` We just turned this one guy into a whole trumpet section . ''
Three different versions of the `` Conquest '' 7-inch were released , each of which featured on the B-side a different song co-produced by Beck and a matador trading card .
Originally popularized by Patti Page , who had a # 18 hit with it in 1952 , `` Conquest '' was a song Jack White wanted to sing for 10 years before he got around to recording it .
In an interview with USA Today , which featured White and Page having a telephone conversation , the White Stripes mainman told the '50s songstress how he often listened to a collection of her hits while working in an upholstery shop he owned in the Detroit area .
He revealed : `` The last song on it was ` Conquest . '
Whenever the first horns came on , I knew that , whatever I was working on , I was going to have to flip the record pretty soon . ''
He added that he finally recorded it , `` Because all the themes on the new Stripes record sort of revolved around role reversals , the underdog becoming the one in control .
The lyrical message in ` Conquest ' is exactly what you root for in life with people you know .
You hope they 'll have the sense to switch a situation around if they 're in peril .
I love how bold the song is , and simple at the same time .
It 's kind of irresistible . ''
In preparation for the video , which features a bullfighting theme , Jack White trained with Dennis Borba , a noted bullfighter .
The promo was shot over two days in Artesia , California , by director Diane Martel , who has also directed for among others Mariah Carey -LRB- `` Dreamlover , '' `` All I Want For Christmas Is You '' -RRB- , Christina Aguilera -LRB- `` Genie in a Bottle , '' `` What a Girl Wants '' -RRB- and The Killers -LRB- `` Read My Mind '' -RRB- .
