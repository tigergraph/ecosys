This wistful portrait of a time when Zooey Deschanel , `` could 've been your girl , you could 've been my four-leaf clover , '' is one of several songs about loss and heartbreak on Volume 3 .
It is likely that they were inspired by the singer 's divorce from Death Cab For Cutie 's Ben Gibbard in 2011 , as this is the first She & Him record since then .
Deschanel 's self-directed video was inspired by her favorite 1960s musicals .
She dances throughout the clip , whilst her She & Him partner , M. Ward , appears as a mean-looking caf√© owner .
Said Deschanel : `` After seven years and four albums with She & Him , I figured it was about time I took a crack at making a video for a song I wrote .
The process was so much fun , and gave me a chance to give a nod to some of my favorite '60s musicals . ''
