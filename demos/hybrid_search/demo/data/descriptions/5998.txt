This song begins with a child being born .
As the song goes on , the child grows into a man who has a child of his own .
The man is seeing himself in his grave with people talking at his funeral -LRB- in the song you can hear people talking in the background -RRB- .
The music begins to fade away and all of a sudden the music starts up again , which shows that the man was just dreaming his death .
He gets a new perspective and wonders why anyone would take life for granted .
The song stresses the importance of living your life to the fullest : spending your `` living days well . ''
