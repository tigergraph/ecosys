Frontman Andrew Goldstein explained to MTV News that this song is , `` about this one situation , where a girl called me over and I went into her house .
She 's like , ` All right , you have to go in through the back door and come up to my bed , ' and so I go , and I walk into the bedroom , I get into the bed , and I realize it 's not the girl 's bedroom , it 's her mom 's .
I 'm not in contact with the girl anymore , but I do talk to the mom . ''
