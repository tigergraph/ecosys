McEntire told Great American Country about this track : `` This is just a kick-ass fun song .
I can see lots of little girls going , ` Yeah , I want to play guitar . '
When I was growing up , guitars were for boys ; that was the men 's instrument , especially an electric guitar .
Girls could play an acoustic guitar .
I remember the girl who played on one of the awards shows with Carrie Underwood .
She got out there and played her butt off .
That was when I found ` Pink Guitar . '
I said , ` She 's going to love this song . '
I love the attitude of it .
It 's still country ; it 's almost like ` Fancy . '
This girl had this dream and she went on to survive and succeed .
It 's real cute and I love to sing it . ''
