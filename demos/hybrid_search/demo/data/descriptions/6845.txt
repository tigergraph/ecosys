This is the first single release from keyboard-playing songstress Marina and the Diamonds .
She explained to Digital Spy why she chose this for her buzz single : `` Because it was n't time for me to release one of my really big songs .
` Mowgli 's Road ' is one of my most uncompromising songs and I wanted to get the message out there that I 'm not a manufactured girl popstar and I 'm going to do my own thing .
I knew it was n't going to be really successful but that was n't the point .
Saying that , getting a song that starts with the word ` cuckoo ' in the charts was worth a shot ! ''
For the song 's video , Marina had two plastic puppet legs bolted to her waist for 17 hours .
She described the promo to the BBC as `` Jim Henson does Beyonc√© 's Single Ladies '' .
The songstress added laughing : `` Making these things is n't all fun and games . ''
The song 's title is a reference to the character in Rudyard Kipling 's The Jungle Book and the track conjures up the sense if not the sound of the English writer 's story .
Marina explained the song 's message to Digital Spy : `` It 's about there being two roads in fame and the industry .
When I wrote it , I did n't know whether I was meant to be some kind of weird indie artist or a big pop thing .
At the end of the day , I just thought , ` You can be both if you want ' .
I 'm a leftfield artist but I want to be really successful .
You know , I think celebrity culture and sexuality in pop music is really important , but I want there to be an alternative for people . ''
