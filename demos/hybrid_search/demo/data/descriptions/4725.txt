This song tells the tale of an aging rock star who has to repeatedly reprise his only hit about an ex at his concerts .
`` There 's a confession in there , and that 's what makes his characters honorable , '' Folds told Reuters .
`` They 're weak and they know it . ''
Folds said to Spinner UK of Hornby 's inspiration for the song : `` He just wonders what that 's like to have to go in front of an audience and profess your love for someone who you probably do n't remember at this point . ''
Nick Hornby was inspired to write the lyrics by Eric Clapton penning `` Layla '' about his then girlfriend , the English model Patti Boyd .
They married in 1979 but divorced ten years later and Clapton has to carry on singing this ode to his former love to this day .
