Transition tells the story of how R&B singer-songwriter and producer Ryan Leslie met a woman during a rehearsal for his showcase at New York 's S.O.B. 's earlier in 2009 .
Upon meeting her , a melody came into his head that he could n't shake .
That melody later became this song , which is one of the album 's key tracks .
Leslie told Global Grind : `` This is my first full rap record .
I wanted to try something different .
I played it for other rappers like Fabolous to make sure I was n't crazy for doing this and I even got Pusha T from the Clipse on the track . ''
