This song is about how when we think we know somebody , we often hardly know that person at all .
`` The Stranger '' is the collective for the unknown things about people we know : `` Although we share so many secrets , there are some we never tell .
`` According to Joel , the song can also relate to how we do n't always know ourselves .
He says that his halfhearted suicide attempt at age 21 -LRB- he tried to end his life by drinking furniture polish -RRB- was an inspiration for the song , as it revealed a dark side of his personality that was n't readily apparent .
-LRB- thanks , Adrian - London , England -RRB- Joel told USA Today July 9 , 2008 : `` After we recorded the song , I remember thinking , ` it needs some sort of introduction .
It needs a prelude or a theme , and then it should slam into the song . '
I played the theme on the piano to show Phil -LRB- Ramone , the album 's producer -RRB- and whistled along with it , and I said , ` What instrument do you think should do that ? '
And Phil said , ` You just did it . '
I heard it played back and went , ` That 's kind of cool , I like that . '
It was really the theme to the album because it was born in the studio during the process , and it just kind of captured the mood . ''
