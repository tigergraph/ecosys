This is a track from A Messenger , the first album to be released by eleventh season American Idol contestant , Colton Dixon .
After being eliminated from Idol , Dixon said he wanted to make a `` faith-based album '' without alienating a wider audience .
He signed to Christian label Sparrow Records in September 2011 and contributed to all of the songs on his debut long-player except for this one .
Dixon told Billboard magazine `` I heard this song from a friend of mine and I just had to have it on my record .
It finished the record perfectly . ''
Multi-instrumentalist Scotty Wilbanks wrote the song .
Wilbanks began his professional music in 1994 when he joined contemporary Christian music act NewSong .
He left the group in 2000 to join Third Day for whom he plays keyboards on tour , and also to produce bands .
