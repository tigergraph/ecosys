Exile in Guyville was written by Phair as a song-by-song reply to the Rolling Stones ' 1972 album , Exile on Main Street and this song corresponds to `` Tumbling Dice . ''
Phair recalled to Rolling Stone in a 2010 interview : `` I remember thinking the most important song happens at the fifth song .
Because in my mind ` Tumbling Dice ' is the big radio hit .
I was like , I need to do the big radio hit there , which is funny because ` Never Said ' ended up being the radio hit off that record for me , and I do n't think Matador would have gone with that just because I said so .
I think that was the natural song to play on the radio and make the video for .
` Never Said ' was one of those times where I was showing I could be just as unaccountable .
` Tumbling Dice ' is really about , again , I 'm picturing all the guys from Urge Overkill , hey man , you may get to go home with me tonight , you may not .
I may show up at the bar and be available , and I might not .
You got ta roll me and see how it 's going to roll .
I was playing that same game . '
I do n't know what you 're talking about , I never said nothing , you ca n't pin that on me . '
I was playing the female version .
Most women do n't spend their lives sitting in bars maybe going home with people , but we often spend our lives socially networking , ` No , I never said that about you behind your back ! ' ''
