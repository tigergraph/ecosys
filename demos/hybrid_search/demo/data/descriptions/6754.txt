Frontwoman Emily Haines named this Synthetica track after a poem by her late poet father Paul Haines , and she described it to Spinner as the `` heart of the record . ''
`` Thought I made a stand , only made a scene . ''
Haines ruefully sings .
Another thread running through the song sees Haines pining for what she sees as a lost age of musical unity .
`` Thousands of people gathered around listening to Bob Dylan songs , Hendrix playing ` All Along The Watchtower , ' that level of communication happening on a mass cultural scale , '' she told The Guardian .
I was feeling like , ` Ah , man , I have n't done that . ' ''
Haines turns the focus back on the music itself , when she sings : `` Have I ever really helped .
Anybody but myself .
To believe in the power of songs ?
To believe in the power of girls ? ''
She explained to UK newspaper The Guardian that this represents several strands of thought coming together , not just about music , but about young women and their relationship to the world : `` There 's a whole generation of girls who are so feminist that pole-dancing is their way of expressing it .
It 's a fu -- ing joke .
It 's brilliant for sexist guys , '' she said .
