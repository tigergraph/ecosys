A track from Greg Lake 's side of the Works , Volume 1 album , this can be seen as both a love song and a song about the quality of faith in the midst of adversity .
Lake refuses to discuss specific song meanings so as not to distort the listener 's interpretation.Works is a double album , with each band member highlighted on one side , and all featuring equally on Side 4 .
The orchestral arrangement was by Godfrey Salmon and Tony Harris , the orchestra and choir were conducted by Godfrey Salmon .
Greg Lake used a Zemaitis 12-string guitar on this track .
Greg Lake wrote this song with Pete Sinfield , who he worked with in King Crimson when Greg formed the band in 1969 .
Sinfield and Lake continued working together when Emerson , Lake & Palmer formed , and the pair also collaborated on Lake 's seasonal hit , `` I Believe In Father Christmas .
`` Lake says that `` Closer To Believing '' is one of his favorites , even though it was not easy to write .
`` It actually took us three months solid , without a break , '' he told us .
Three months we worked on the song .
Day in , day out , day in , day out , three months .
And that was hard .
But in the end , we felt that was worth it .
We were very proud of the result . ''
