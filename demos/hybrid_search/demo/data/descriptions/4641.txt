This is a track from British soul and R&B singer Beverley Knight 's sixth studio album , 100 % .
The song is a duet with soul legend Chaka Khan .
Knight explained on her website : `` I wrote it with Guy Chambers , at first intending to give it to Tina Turner as a testament to her years of staying in the music industry .
I loved it so much I decided to keep it , but felt after I had sung it down that a legendary voice could add something extra special to it .
Enter the incredible Chaka Khan who flew into London to perform the track as a duet with me in the studio .
It was utterly fantastic !
We both see ourselves as soul survivors ; we have rode through the ups and downs in our musical careers , and we are both still here and loving it ! ''
Knight co-wrote this rocking track with Guy Chambers , who has done a lot of work with Robbie Williams .
Knight recalled to The Guardian March 12 , 2010 : `` I was flowing that day -- we had the melody and the lyrics done within two hours and then we spent the rest of the day putting the music in place .
We got to the studio at midday and left at 6pm , with most of it done . ''
