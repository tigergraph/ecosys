Main songwriter Nick Jonas told The London Times May 18 , 2009 that he penned this address to a combative girlfriend out of personal experience .
He explained : `` It was about this relationship .
This person kept on fighting , and making out like it was world war three , when it was really a one-sided battle .
It was just them coming at you , and you do n't really have any problem .
`` Nick 's comments got the bloggers guessing whether the combative ex that he is referring to is Miley Cyrus with whom he had a two-year relationship .
Nick Jonas initially intended this to be recorded by his side project Nick Jonas & the Administration .
