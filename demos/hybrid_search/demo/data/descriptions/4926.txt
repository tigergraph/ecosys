This song is part of the Download To Donate To Haiti compilation , which raised money to help Haiti after they suffered a severe earthquake .
The song is Linkin Park 's message to the country that the rest of the world is thinking of them and will support them .
The video shows images of the disaster in Haiti .
The intro to this song is just some piano keys , but it sounds odd because it 's reversed .
-LRB- thanks , Anney - O'Porto , Portugal , for above 2 -RRB-
