This song finds Aaron Lewis singing about the Devil , partying , and some Country music greats .
It was the last song he wrote for The Road and was inspired by a stay in the place known as Sin City .
`` Las Vegas really is , in a metaphorical sense , a party in hell ; you can get into anything you want to , '' he told Reuters .
`` It was like well , ` OK , I 'm going to hell , who else is going to be there ?
We might as well have a party with it . ' ''
