This song was originally written by singer-songwriter Dilana about how her live changed after she was the runner-up contestant on the CBS reality television show Rock Star : Supernova .
She released it as a digital only single in 2007 and it also appears on her 2009 album , Inside Out .
Iraheta spoke to Yahoo !
Music about covering the track : `` I was a big fan of Dilana 's ... I never watched the show , but I checked it out online once and I was like ` Homegirl can sang ! '
Kinda crazy , I did n't know she was going to release that in her album .
I mean , I would have never covered it if I knew she as going to release it cause it 's all her , but I think it definitely has room for both of us because we each bring something different to the table .
dear God , her voice is ridiculous ; I love it ... I wish I could talk to her and be like , ` Thanks for making such a dope-ass song !
Wow .
It 's cool . ' ''
