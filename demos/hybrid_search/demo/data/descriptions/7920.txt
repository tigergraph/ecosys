Gym Class Heroes MC Travie McCoy drops a verse on this track .
On her record label 's website , Simpson explained that with this track she had n't gone ` Gangsta ' : `` No , it is n't serious , based on a true story or a threat .
It 's a metaphor about a girl who can get away with murder because of who she is .
The lyrics should be followed by an exaggerated evil laugh . ''
