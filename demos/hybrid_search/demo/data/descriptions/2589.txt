Amy MacDonald explained to the Liverpool Daily Post that this song is about people rather than music .
She said : `` The whole message is just be yourself .
It 's about two people who 've been pretending to be something they 're not in order to fit in with a certain group , and because of that , these amazing people who would have got on so well and made a brilliant couple pass each other by .
Both of them have been feeling that they 've had to fit in elsewhere , but they 've missed out as a result . ''
