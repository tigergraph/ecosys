This whistle-laden live-for-the moment tune finds Ke $ ha reverting back to the irreverent Pop-Rap style of her debut release , Animal .
The queen of the white-trash outcasts does not pull any punches as she spits nonchalant cuss-filled rhymes .
`` I 'm fresher than that Gucci .
Them boys , they want my coochie , '' she raps .
`` I say no , I 'm no hoochie , our homegirl hating , I say , ` Who 's she ? ' ''
Ke $ ha explained in her official track-by-track commentary : '' ` Crazy Kids ' is an anthem for people like me , my animals and many people in the world who are crazy and not afraid to show it , and actually proud of it . ''
The lyrics were inspired by a birthday party of Ke $ ha 's , which she described as , `` one crazy night . ''
`` That particular birthday was really bad ... and fun .
But at the end of the night , I was having so much fun , at like 7 a.m. ; I was literally jumping by myself on a mini trampoline going ` I 'm having so much fun . '
And then , for my birthday party , I got a tattoo artist , so everybody -LSB- who -RSB- came could get a tattoo to remember the night , '' she recalled to MTV News .
`` And so I could n't figure out what to get so I just got ` fun ' tattooed on my foot .
So now I have a tattoo to remember that night . ''
Ke $ ha added that she was also inspired by her equally crazy fans .
`` As I look around the room , there 's a lot of kids with glitter and wild style and you like to express yourself , right ?
I feel like for those of us that like to express ourselves and are n't so concerned with being super-duper normal , that you 're called kind of crazy a lot , '' she said .
`` And instead of it being a negative thing , I wanted it to be an anthem like , ` Yeah we 're crazy ! ' ''
Ke $ ha told MTV News about will.i.am 's verse for the celebratory jam : `` He and I wrote the song together , so it seemed like a natural thing for him to be on it , and his verse is really funny ; he talks about boobies .
Anytime somebody says anything about boobies , it 's great -- love it . ''
Ke $ ha revealed to Australian radio show Kyle and Jackie O. how the collaboration with will.i.am came about .
`` We were both playing our music as loud as we could and trying to outdo each other and then we met in the hallway and decided to do it together , '' she explained .
`` He 's totally crazy , '' she added .
`` No matter where I go in the world , everyone calls me crazy and he was like , ` me too ! '
and I was like , ` We should make a declaration and say we 're proud of it . '
Afterwards we went out and we were racing in the middle of the street just like running 'cause we were so excited about the song ! ''
Ke $ ha 's longtime collaborators Lukasz `` Dr. Luke '' Gottwald , Benny Blanco and Cirkut , supplied the grimey beat .
They are the same trio who produced the first two singles from Warrior , `` Die Young '' and `` C'Mon . ''
This was released as the third single from Warrior on April 29 , 2013 .
Ke $ ha recorded two remixes for the single version .
The first official remix has a new verse by Will.i.am , who co-penned the original song .
Kesha 's second verse is omitted completely in favor of Will.i.am 's verse .
The second official remix , which features Pitbull , follows the same formula as the Will.i.am remix and also has the song 's second verse removed in favor of Pitbull 's new verse .
Ke $ ha previously worked with the rapper when she guested on his 2009 track `` Girls . ''
A third remix featuring rapper Juicy J was sent to US Rhythmic radio and became available for purchase as a digital download on May 21 , 2013 .
When the song debuted on the Hot 100 it was credited as by Ke $ ha featuring will.i.am or Juicy J.
