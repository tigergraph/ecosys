This portrait of love and devotion among a couple `` till death do us part '' was written by Ashley Gorley and Bob Regan .
Gorley also has writing credits for Carrie Underwood , `` Do n't Forget To Remember Me '' and `` All American Girl '' and Trace Adkins ' `` You 're Gon na Miss This . ''
Randy Travis told The Tennessean July 15 , 2008 about this song .
He said : `` It made me think of something Vern Gosdin would have done years ago .
The title is a little deceiving .
When you hear ` Dig Two Graves , ' it could have gone in two directions .
It 's really a love song , saying basically , ` If you go before me , I might as well go , because I would have no reason for me staying . ' ''
