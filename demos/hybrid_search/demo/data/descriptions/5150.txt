The Dillinger Escape Plan are generally associated with the mathcore genre , a rhythmically complex and dissonant style of metalcore , which makes use of unusual time signatures .
However , on this track the band step out of their `` perceived comfort zone . ''
Bassist Liam Wilson explained to The Associated Press : `` It 's a more rock - or dare I invoke ` grunge ' - than what we 're typically known or revered .
It 's sculpted using arguably more authentic and mature Dillinger-esque stylings than previous efforts while opting for a tried and true song structure of verse/pre-chorus/chorus / bridge .
It 's the sort of song that 's surprisingly most challenging and simultaneously rewarding for us to write ; dodging clich√©s like bullets in the Matrix as fast as we 're indulging in them . ''
Wilson explained the song 's lyrical content : `` This is a song about keeping your priorities in order during an age when taking care of the luxuries and letting the necessities take care of themselves is often the default mode of thinking ourselves into a proverbial corner . ''
