Frontman Nathan Leone -LRB- from Rock Sound magazine -RRB- : `` This was initially meant to be an instrumental track but Matthew -LSB- Leone , bass -RSB- had this idea to build the dynamic by introducing drum and bass teasers .
Mateo -LSB- Camargo , guitar -RSB- kept the integrity intact by denying my many attempts at repeating the chorus three times and there ya have it . ''
Matthew Leone was critically injured on June 30 , 2010 after coming to the rescue of a woman who was being beaten by her husband .
He suffered many injuries including a fractured skull , broken jaw and a swollen brain and it was touch and go whether he would survive .
His twin brother Nathan told Rock Sound , lyrically this song `` was inspired when Matthew got hurt and for the first time I felt split in two . ''
