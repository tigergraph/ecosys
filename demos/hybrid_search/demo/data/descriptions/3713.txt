This is one of the most passionate and soulful ever written about cheating .
Written by the Stax songwriters Homer Banks , Ray Jackson and Carl Hampton , the song finds a married man with two children enthralled with his mistress .
Despite warnings from his friends , he just ca n't help the way he feels , and is compelled to be with the other woman .
Millie Jackson used this song as the basis for her landmark album Caught Up , where she sung the first side of the album from the perspective of the mistress and the second side as the wife who was being cheated on .
In our 2010 interview with Millie Jackson , she said : `` When I write a story like that , I like to balance it out so people on both sides can see what 's going on .
That 's why I did the wife and the girlfriend .
And when I do my live performances , the women were always my biggest fans , but now I do both .
I talk about the women , and then I go and I talk about the men , which the women expect me to do , but then I 'll talk about the men and the women , so it can be balanced out that way .
Try to keep it on an even keel . ''
Banks , Jackson and Hampton wrote the song in the middle of the night sometime around 1970 .
The had the Stax girl-group The Emotions record the song , but their uptempo version did n't work and the song sat on the shelf until the R&B singer Luther Ingram found the tape while visiting the studios .
He took the tape and worked out a more mournful arrangement with a Gospel feel .
Then he recorded the song at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Alabama , utilizing a Wurlitzer piano with an Echoplex unit and also a Hammond organ .
The song became a # 1 R&B hit for Ingram .
Other big names to cover this song include Isaac Hayes , Barbara Mandrell , Rod Stewart and Cassandra Wilson .
Mandrell 's version charted at # 31 in the US in 1979 .
