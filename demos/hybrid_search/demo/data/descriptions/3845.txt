This is a cover of a 1965 recording by the Texan R&B star Barbara Lynn , which Plant came across on a CD that was included in a copy of The Oxford American magazine .
He told Mojo : `` I know what I know , and what I bring to the party is black American pop from 1963 New Orleans . ''
Barbara Lynn - born Barbara Lynn Olsen - is one of those rarest of creatures , a black female guitarist .
Although she is a songwriter , she did n't write this one .
Running to 1 minute 55 seconds , the 1965 Immediate Record release is credited to B & B Babino , who are Billy and Bobby Babineaux.Immediate was a UK based company ; in the US it was released on Jamie Records backed by `` That 's What A Friend Will Do '' .
Although Robert Plant performed with a female vocalist in addition to his band , most discerning listeners will prefer the original version , if only because it sounds rather silly to hear a man singing about his would-be lover giving him diamonds and pearls !
Robert Plant performed this song live on The Andrew Marr Show on September 5 , 2010 ; earlier , he told host Marr it was a response by Barbara Lynn to `` Ca n't Buy Me Love '' .
He said he found it in a compilation put out by a literary magazine in the Deep South ; this was actually Invitation Oxford - Oxford , Tennessee , not that other literary place called Oxford !
