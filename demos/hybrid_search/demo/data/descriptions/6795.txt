The Vaccines consider themselves a Pop band in a Rock format , and their second album finds them ` coming of age . '
Frontman Justin Young explained to NME how this song fits in with the rest of the disc : `` Because there 's a lyrical and emotional cohesion I think we felt free for there to not be so much sonic cohesion , '' he said .
`` It 's important for us not to sound the same across the record , but I guess what ` All In Vain ' does have in common is that it 's a simple pop song . ''
Young explained The Vaccines Come of Age album title to Q magazine : `` It 's very tongue-in-cheek , it 's a joke , '' he said .
`` In the same way the first one was a joke too .
I like having the name in the titles because it sounds classic , Meet The Beatles , More From The Monkees , The Freewheelin ' Bob Dylan .
Also it is a lyric from one of the singles -LRB- ` No Hope ' -RRB- , but lyrically it 's actually : ` It 's hard to come of age , ' so if you 're going to take it seriously you need to think of it in that context , as a human being and not as a singer in a band .
But purely taken as The Vaccines Come of Age , that 's supposed to disarming . ''
