The lead single from The Band Perry 's sophomore album finds Kimberley Perry singing of her undying love for her spouse .
The song was penned by Nashville songwriters Shane McAnally and Trevor Rosen , who also co-penned Chris Young 's single `` Neon . ''
Also contributing was Brandy Clark , who previously teamed up with McAnally to write Miranda Lambert 's `` Mama 's Broken Heart '' and David Nail 's `` That 's How I 'll Remember You . ''
It was originally demoed by Kacey Musgraves .
This was The Band Perry 's third Country # 1 following `` If I Die Young '' and `` All My Life . ''
This was originally recorded by Jo Dee Messina under the title of `` Put Me In The Ground . ''
It was the last song that she recorded for her former label .
Messina told Billboard magazine : `` They did n't hear it , and would n't commit to it being a single , so the writers said they would n't license it because The Band Perry wanted to cut it .
It was a # 1 record for them under the title ` Better Dig Two . '
I 'm so glad they did it because I knew the song was a smash when I heard it .
We did it live , and people loved it .
I 'm glad someone did hear it because the writers deserved it to be out there . ''
The Band Perry officially debuted the hard-driving track when they performed it at the 46th Annual CMA Awards .
Preceding the awards , the siblings spoke to on-air personalities about the tune , calling it `` the ultimate love song ... the kind of love not even death can separate . ''
Fans of anything Southern Gothic , the Perrys were instantly drawn to the song .
`` Every time we hear a song and it sounds like we would have written it , we always are willing to cut it , '' Neil Perry told The Boot .
`` That song has all the elements that we love in a great song ... it 's got that Southern Gothic kind of feel to it , and it 's a love song .
But it 's written in kind of a dark way and that 's what we really like about it . ''
