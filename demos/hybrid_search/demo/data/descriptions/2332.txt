This song chronicles the history of Alexander the Great .
He was King of Macedonia from 356-323 B.C. .
The city of Alexandria , Egypt was founded in his name in 331 B.C. , and he was known as one of the most feared conquerors of all time .
He became King of Macedonia when he was 19 and died of fever in Babylon according to the song at age 33 .
The cause of his death has many different theories to this day .
This is one of Iron Maiden 's longer songs at 8:35 .
It is an elaborate arrangement with a killer guitar solo in the middle .
