In July 1994 the Manics lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Cardiff and , later , to the Priory in London for treatment for self-harm , alcoholism and anorexia .
Six months later he disappeared , leaving a notebook containing various lyrics including the words for this song .
Vocalist James Dean Bradfield explained to NME May 16 , 2009 : `` There 're some people he met when he was in one of the two places having treatment and I think he just digested other people 's stories and experiences . ''
Bassist Nicky Wire admitted to the NME that he `` did rearrange a couple of lines to fit . ''
He added : `` And the one line that always haunted me , which I do n't know how we got in there , was ` salmon pink skinned Mary , still caring ' .
It reminds me a bit of the play we did in O-Level , An Inspector Calls , when the girl , does n't she pour bleach , to kill herself , by drinking bleach ?
I ca n't quite remember , but it might have something to do with that .
I think the title is more scary than the lyric in this one .
A lot of people have been shocked by the title .
Once again , in inimitable and bizarre Manics way , we just never get shocked by stuff like that . ''
