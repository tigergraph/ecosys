This Folk-flavored soft ballad finds Mayer duetting with Katy Perry .
The pair had been dating on and off since the summer of 2012 and it finds the twosome trading verses about their love for each other .
This was the first musical collaboration between the couple .
John Mayer told Billboard magazine that he wanted to write a melodic and confessional song about accepting who you love .
`` I started singing ` And my girl , she ai n't the one I saw coming .
Sometimes I do n't know which way to go .
And I tried to run before , but I 'm not running anymore . '
In 2013 , modern-day times that 's sweet .
Because there 's so many other things to occupy your time that you can do for yourself .
That to say , I tried to be alone but I ca n't .
This is sort of our generation . ''
Speaking with US radio station Z100 , Mayer admitted that he initially had reservations over the collaboration .
Said Mayer : `` I had this idea that just sat around for a while and I thought , ` Maybe I 'll finish it some day ' , and I played it for Don Was who was producing the record with me and he said , ` Get Katy to sing on it ' .
` Now , he could say that because he does n't have to worry about all the hang-ups that I 'd have to worry about . ''
Mayer added that despite their different methods of working , the pair were `` professional '' while recording the duet .
`` She was an artist in the studio and partner out of the studio .
It was really professional , '' he explained . ''
There was a moment where she was like , ` Let me just go through it once ' , and the way I work is , ` Let 's get this and that and that ' , and she was like , ` Let me try it my way . ' ''
`` We were just fine before we met each other , that 's what we say , '' he continued , '' ` You were fine before I met you , you do n't need my advice , ' and vice versa . ''
Perry sings , `` You 're the one I love , '' to close the track before bursting into a giggle .
`` I think that 's just a love giggle , '' she explained to SiriusXM Hits 1 .
`` It 's like the ones that Mariah Carey had in 1990 and stuff like that .
Yeah , I think I was going for that , I think I was just so happy , I love that song . ''
Mayer told Billboard that the idea of the gentle , breezy song could be described as `` I love you based on the fact that I 've tried to run and I 'm not running and I give up . ''
He added that Perry wrote her contribution , a verse admitting `` my boy was not the one that I saw coming , some have said his heart 's too hard to hold . ''
Mayer continued : `` I immediately thought about Katy and I was like , what a cool voice .
What a cool artistic personality to have on .
It was a really fun opportunity for her to write like , her answer to that .
So you get these two sides to this relationship that are brutally honest but no less universal . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Sophie Muller -LRB- Rihanna 's `` Stay , '' Pink 's `` True Love . '' -RRB-
The clip features scenes of various couples , including Mayer and Perry , riding a mechanical bull .
Mayer said during an interview on Good Morning America : `` We set the casting call out for real couples .
So it 's just so authentic .
There 's nothing scripted in that video , except maybe putting a bull in the desert . ''
As for why why the couple decided to ride a mechanical bull in the visual , Perry explained .
`` Relationships are like riding a bull .
You get back on . ''
