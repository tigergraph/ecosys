You can put on .
Wear your best clothes if it 's in your closet and just from the cleaners and it 's clean .
That 's what putting on is .
Wear your watch .
It might not be the iciest , but it 's yours .
You may not have no 26s , you got 24s , but you putting on .
There might not be nobody standing next to you who has 24s on at the time . ''
