This song evolved over a long period of time .
Keyboardist Kelcey Ayer told Q magazine : `` I had it for a long time on piano and it has this sombre feel .
It never felt right .
We 've had it since 2010 and we 've worked on it .
But at the beginning of last year Ryan Hahn and I started messing around with it - it was a our first foray into synths - and got it totally right .
So I was glad we figured it out .
We were working on it for so long , it was pissing me off ! ''
