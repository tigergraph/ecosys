Vocalist Ben Bridwell explained this lilting sing-along number to The Skinny : `` This is a song of Ryan Munroe 's -LRB- keyboardist -RRB- which he wrote quite a way back and we 've been playing it live for a long time .
Like ` Evening Kitchen ' it showcases the other members , which has been my main goal with this record . ''
