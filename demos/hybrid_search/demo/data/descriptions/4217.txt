This is the first single from British singer-songwriter David Gray 's ninth studio album , Foundling .
The song features on the record 's bonus disc .
Foundling was released just 11 months after Gray 's previous album , Draw The Line , and consists of the `` quieter moments '' laid down by the singer around the same time .
`` It was recorded during the same session when we were n't tracking as a band , '' Gray explained to Billboard magazine .
`` I would do stuff on my own , and it was at times like that when some of these songs came together , so -LSB- Foundling -RSB- is almost like the solo record I made in-between making the band record . ''
Gray admitted to Billboard magazine that this is n't his favorite track on the album .
`` I do n't have fond feelings for it , '' he confessed .
`` I was contacted about doing some music for a -LSB- soccer -RSB- tournament a few years ago , and this was my stab on it based on the brief I was given .
Unfortunately it got used on the telly and then people heard of it , and when anybody thinks there 's any chance of a hit record at radio they just wo n't let go of the damn thing .
So it got let out of the cupboard , and it 's ended up on this bonus disc ... It 's just one of those throwaway moments that other people seize upon .
But it does n't really fit with Foundling , which is very much where my heart lies . ''
