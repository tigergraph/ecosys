Following Rihanna 's duet with Chris Brown , `` Nobody 's Business , '' on the track listing , this deeply personal , two-part emotional retreat appears to be about her self-destructive relationship with the singer .
The first part sees Rihanna mourning the events when she became the most famous victim of domestic abuse in recent memory -LRB- `` Who knew the course of this one drive , injured us fatally '' -RRB- .
The second half sees the Barbadian songstress confessing her confused emotions -LRB- `` Mother Mary , I swear I wan na change '' -RRB- , before giving way to her feelings for Brown -LRB- `` Let 's live in the moment .
As long as we got each other .
Die in the moment .
I 'm prepared to die in the moment '' -RRB- .
The song features a rhythmic riff reminiscent of the one in The Police 's 1979 hit , `` Message In a Bottle . ''
