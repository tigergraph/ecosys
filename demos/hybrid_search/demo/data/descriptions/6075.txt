This tells the story of Seasick Steve 's beloved dog Boss , who passed away around the time the album was being recorded .
Steve told The Sun newspaper September 19 , 2008 : `` That dog broke my heart .
I had a lot of animals but they would just come and go but we got him as a puppy and he lived to be ten , which is too young .
Sometimes I was thinking I 'm getting tired of having this dog .
Part of me was like , ` When you gon na die ? '
Then he dropped dead and I cried like a baby .
It was like losing a kid . ''
