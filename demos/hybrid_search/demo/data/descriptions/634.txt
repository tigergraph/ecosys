This single by Kid Cudi , from his Indicud album , was produced by the Cleveland rapper/singer himself .
He explained : `` Here 's what I did .
I took one of my favorite bands MGMT 's song `` Congratulatons '' , put it in reverse , sped it up , and produced over it .
`` New York based dance punk act MGMT previously guested on Cudi 's 2009 track `` Pursuit Of Happiness . ''
Cudi talks in the first verse about a moment when positive energy hit him `` like lightning '' through his veins .
He told Billboard magazine how it `` just hit me one day . ''
`` It was definitely something that just kind of popped up , '' he recalled .
`` I 'm pretty sure it was a gradual transition over time and growth .
When it came time to start making records and expressing myself , I was totally in a different mindset .
And all the other stuff that I had done previously , I was in a state of ... distress or depression or isolation , whatever it was .
And that 's how those songs came about .
But this was a whole other thing for me .
I ca n't recall a specific moment .
It just happened one day when I was starting to write my songs .
That 's when I start to have my reflective moments .
And then I was like , ` Wow , I really am in a different space . '
I came up with that hook first .
And then I 'm like , ` Why did I come up with that hook ?
` Immortal . '
What am I saying here ? ''
I have all these revelations as I 'm writing .
Each song is like a chapter of my diary . ''
Cudi quotes line from the Adam Sandler movie Billy Madison at the beginning of this track .
He explained to Billboard : '' ` I 'm the smartest man alive ! '
resonated with me .
And Adam Sandler is like a god to me .
He 's so amazing .
I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know , like , ` You 're the s -- t ! ' ''
Cudi namechecks his breakthrough single in the second verse when he raps `` It 's the same old thing getting lost Day 'N' Nite young and lost in the pain . ''
Cudi explained to Billboard why he chose to borrow from `` Congratulations '' for this song .
`` I 'm not that big a fan of sampling , '' he said .
`` But I feel like if I 'm going to do it , I 'm going to do it to where it 's more of a reimagining of a track .
The songs that I do utilize samples on , most of it you would n't even be able to tell what it was unless I told you .
Like for ` Immortal , ' most people would n't know that was ` Congratulations ' unless I said anything .
It 's almost unrecognizable .
It does n't sound like I just chopped up a bunch of s -- t .
There were a lot of technical things that I went in there with my engineer and did where I filtered out the sample , took away the drums and turn up the melodies in the sample .
I knew what I wanted .
It was always an idea of mine to sample one of MGMT 's songs .
` Congratulations ' was perfect .
I 'm really happy that they cleared it .
It 's one of the songs that I had been waiting for people to hear . ''
