This uplifting lead single from Jamie Cullum 's The Momentum album leapt into his life without warning .
He explained : `` I was singing it to myself before I knew I 'd written it !
I wanted to write a song that was positive about the future even if you do n't always feel that way . ''
The Momentum disc has one theme running through it : `` The album is about that crossover period from youth into adulthood where you still have one foot in each '' explained Cullum .
`` You start to understand the world in such a different way and see things more as they are - both ugly and beautiful .
You 're caught between that fresh sense of the wider picture whilst still battling those same old issues within your own head .
` Take Me Out -LRB- Of Myself -RRB- ' through to ` Everything You Did n't Do ' to ` Get A Hold of Yourself . '
Have I done enough ?
Have I achieved all that I thought I would ?
What about everything I did n't do ? ''
