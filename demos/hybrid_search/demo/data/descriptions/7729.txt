The first single from British indie rock band Kasabian 's fourth album , Velociraptor was this Dan the Automator produced monster .
The song was debuted during Zane Lowe 's show on BBC Radio 1 on June 7 , 2011 .
Guitarist and lead songwriter Serge Pizzorno told XFM radio that for Velociraptor 's first single he `` wanted a song that sounded like the inner mechanism in a machinegun .
I wanted a sound like energy and chaos . ''
Vocalist Tom Meighan told NME : `` It 's got that ` Sabotage ' Beastie Boys edge to it , but it 's pure Kasabian really .
The confusion and noise and melodies and drops and breaks .
It 's the older brother of ` Vlad . ' ''
Pizzorno told Q : `` The title was inspired by this interview with Morgan Freeman where he described someone as having a ` switchblade smile . '
I knew exactly what he meant .
One of those people who seem pretty friendly but you know underneath they 're a right evil f -- er . ''
