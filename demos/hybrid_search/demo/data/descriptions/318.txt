Teddy Thompson spoke to The Sun August 15 , 2008 regarding this ironic song about suicide .
He explained : `` That was always tongue in cheek for me .
I was heading for Randy Newman territory with a little bit of black humor .
I thought it was obvious and quite funny and then when we turned it in to the record label in America they had a total meltdown .
We had the sound of a gunshot and they made us take that off .
They said : ` You ca n't !
None of the stores will carry it . '
People get overly sensitive .
I know suicide in itself is n't really that funny , but you 're in serious trouble if you ca n't laugh at something . ''
