This is the second major record label single released by R&B singer Auburn and the follow-up to her breakthrough hit `` La La La. '' The song finds Auburn half-singing , half-rapping about meeting her true love , then in the chorus she expresses her feelings about her man : `` Cause I 'm all about him him him him him / And he 's all about me me me me me / And we do n't give a dang dang dang dang dang about nobody-e-e-e-e . ''
