Tame Impala is a Psychedelic Rock project led by Australian musician , singer and producer Kevin Parker .
Their name refers to the impala , a medium sized antelope , `` Not so much domesticated , the band explained to FasterLouder , `` more like , less afraid of things ; not running away all the time . ''
This is the first single from their second album , Lonerism .
Tame Impala took home the Best Album award at the 2013 ARIAs for Lonerism .
They also won Best Rock Album and Best Band at the event .
Parker explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` It 's not really a song about being a loner ; it 's a song about the bully , '' he said .
`` The guy who thinks he 's great .
The jock .
You can imagine a real reclusive kind of guy who 's a bit bitter about this guy who thinks he 's great .
Which is the opposite vibe of the loner , so it presents him in the worst light . ''
