Sugarland is the sassy basket -LRB- her description , not ours -RRB- Jennifer Nettles and her musical partner , the multi-instrumentalist Kristian Bush .
Speaking with us about this song in our 2010 interview , Nettles explained : '' ` Shine The Light , ' is just a beautiful gospel influenced song that I actually wrote for Kristian .
He was going through a tough time in his life , and it was based on a conversation that he and I were having about that .
And I had said to him , ` There are times in our lives and places in our lives that only we can go ourselves .
We have to go into those woods ourselves .
And hopefully when we get there , as we get closer , we 'll see all the people that we love standing at the edge holding a flashlight to show us the way out . '
And so that was the inspiration for that song , and I hope it 's something that touches people , and that they play it for those who they love who need it . ''
