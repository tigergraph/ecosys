In August 1992 , Thunder appeared at the 13th annual Monsters Of Rock at Castle Donnington .
On the eve of the Festival they were interviewed by DJ Tommy Vance for The Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio One , where they played a short acoustic set live .
Asked about the inspiration for the song , writer Luke Morley said it was based on personal experience ; in particular a visit to New York where he had seen people living rough on the streets , sights you did n't see in Catford -LRB- South London -RRB- adding `` unfortunately now you do . ''
As they began playing , he , or one of the band , said `` hope you 're listening John Major ; '' this was a dig at the then Prime Minister .
John Major replaced Margaret Thatcher in November 1990 , after she was forced to resign by a Cabinet rebellion .
`` Low Life In High Places '' was the band 's 7th single , and the first from the album .
It was released in various formats including a 4 track CD single - with `` Back Street Symphony , '' `` She 's So Fine '' and `` Love Walked In '' - and as both a 7 inch and 12 inch single .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for all above -RRB- Although widely regarded as a champion of the free market , Thatcher 's financial reforms had caused great hardship to the people at the bottom of the social ladder , especially the young ; Major inherited this economic turmoil .
As the 1990s approached , people all over Britain and especially the capital began to witness sights that had n't been seen here since the turn of the Century , large numbers of vulnerable young people begging and even sleeping on the streets.Luke Morley was born in Camberwell , a short bus ride from Catford , in the deprived London Borough of Lewisham , and was obviously speaking from the heart .
