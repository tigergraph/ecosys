Marling told Q magazine about this dark whirling waltz piece of self-analysis : `` I think it 's easier to write an unhappy song .
I 've found myself in very happy situations over the past three years and they 've been the times I have n't written any songs .
It 's a bit scary .
The more I feel perfectly happy , which is the goal , the less I want to write .
But the really sad things that happen in my life I would n't write about .
They 're no one else 's business but my own .
None of my songs are me with my heart on my sleeve going , Help me .
It 's not really like that .
It 's more self-discovery . ''
