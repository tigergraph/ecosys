Big Daddy Weave is a five member Christian rock band composed of frontman Mike Weaver -LRB- lead singer -RRB- , plus Jay Weaver , Jeremy Redmon , Jeff Jones and Joe Shirk .
Their name comes partly from one of Mike Weaver 's nicknames `` Big Daddy '' and also from his and his brother Jay 's surname .
Mike Weaver explained on the liner notes for Wow Hits 2008 , that he penned this song about his relationship with God during a time when he was struggling with his Christian walk .
He said : `` This song was written during a really dry time in my walk with God .
He showed me not to be afraid of the desert , because in the wilderness is an awesome opportunity to push the reset button on our desire for Him .
It says in His word that we will seek Him and find Him when we seek Him with our whole heart .
Sometimes it takes the desert to make us so thirsty that we realize nothing else will satisfy but Jesus .
On the other side of those dry waits a refreshing moment by moment relationship with God , where we encounter His greatness and respond naturally with lives of worship-just like breathing . ''
