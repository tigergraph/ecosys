This is the first single from American hard rock band Saving Abel 's second album , Miss America .
Frontman Jared Weeks explained the meaning of the song in an interview with Shauna O'Donnell on the internet radio station MUEN Talk : '' -LRB- Producer -RRB- Skidd Mills and I wrote that in the studio .
We wrote it two days after the Grammy 's this year .
We were fortunate enough to get to go and be a part of the experience .
Two days later we were in the studio and I was reading a quote by Marilyn Monroe that stated ' A wise girl always kisses before she 's kissed , leaves before she 's left and forgets before she 's forgotten . '
To me , that says a lot about her because you know she was n't stupid , she knew what was going on .
The message of the song is about one of those Hollywood girls trying to use everybody and work her way up the ladder .
It 's a simple song and it says a lot .
I 'm a big Marilyn fan , so I wanted to get her involved in my music somehow .
We had the Hollywood theme going in our heads still , so we were excited about writing it .
It was one of the last songs on the record that we wrote which ended up being the first single .
It was the same with ` Addicted . '
We are hoping it follows the same format . ''
