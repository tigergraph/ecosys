This drinking song was written by Brett and Jim Beavers with Brad and Brett Warren ; Solo is a brand of disposable cups that are often filled with beer from a keg and found scattered about the next morning after the party .
`` I do n't remember who played it for me the first time , but it was so stupid I just died laughing , '' recalled Keith .
`` What 's great about this song is it does everybody the same way it did me : ` That 's the stupidest song in the world and I ca n't get it out of my head . '
I laugh every time I hear it .
Sometimes it 's good for the world to hear something like that . ''
Keith explained the song 's meaning : `` The song is basically a bunch of frat party people getting hammered , drinking out of a red Solo cup and all the stupid stuff they do .
They actually praise the red Solo cup for all the important things and usages that it has .
You 're going to find it really stupid but you 'll be singing it the next day when you wake up . ''
How many celebrities can you name in the star-studded music video ?
If you recognized all of Larry Bird , Lance Burton , Eric Church , Roger Clemens , Jeff Dunham , Craig Ferguson , Sammy Hagar , Joe Nichols and Ted Nugent , we say reward yourself with a red cup filled with your favorite beverage !
When Keith decided to record the song he decided that he did n't want to make it his version of what the Beavers and Warren brothers wrote .
Instead , he decided to make them part of it .
He said : `` We brought them in when we cut it , to play and sing background , so it really sounds like them . ''
Keith explained to The Boot that he decided to cut this for Clancy 's Tavern , as he `` did n't have a bus song like ` Weed With Willie ' or ` Get Out of Your Clothes or Get Out of My Car . '
The Beavers and Warren brothers never intended the song to be pitched to anyone to record , but Keith got to hear the tune after someone who worked for him played it .
