In this song Noah `` Panda Bear '' Lennox pays tribute to domestic morning ritual .
He sings lovingly of taking his daughter for a walk through the Barrio Alto to his local playground .
Brian `` Geologist '' Weltz told the French magazine VoxPop that `` at the base '' , this `` is a song by Noah . ''
He added : `` This is our most ` hip hop ' song with the huge bass and feeling almost R & B at certain times .
The end of the song is my favorite bit of the record . ''
