In this song , we hear Starr recalling his youthful self walking to Liverpool 's Iron Door club to play with late '50s and early '60s band Rory Storm and The Hurricanes .
The track continues a tradition begun on the title track of Liverpool 8 in which Ringo and Dave Stewart pen an autobiographical song about the former Beatle 's home city .
`` I 've decided that instead of an autobiography , I 'm going to do a Liverpool song on every record , '' he told Mojo .
`` How long it lasts I do n't know .
If you listen to ` The Other Side of Liverpool , ' it was very personal : my mum was a barmaid , my dad left when I was three .
` In Liverpool ' picks it up in my teenage years , from me and the boys when I was in school , to me and the girls when I was in a band and playing the Iron Door - which was a great club .
Everybody talks about the Cavern but no-one talks about the Iron Door . ''
