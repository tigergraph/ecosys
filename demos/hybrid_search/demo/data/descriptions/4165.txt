Urban -LRB- From Roughstock -RRB- : My bass player , Jerry Flowers , who goes back to The Ranch , was one of the writers of this song .
Jerry played it for me a long time back and I loved it .
I thought it was a cool lyric and a really great thing to say .
When I came to make this record , this song came back to me . ''
Urban added to Roughstock that he wanted to keep this song , `` lean and mean .
If AC/DC had a banjo , it would be somewhere in this vein .
I wanted some of that simplicity . ''
