This prostitute-centric song finds Cave singing of `` a girl named Bee '' who lived on Jubilee Street .
She would say to `` all those good people , '' who also lived on the street , that they , `` ought to practice what they preach . ''
Asked by The Sun if he is referencing the Jubilee Street located in his hometown of Brighton , Cave replied : `` If people think they 're going to have a good time down Jubilee Street , I 'd say forget about it unless they 're particularly interested in going to the library or Yo Sushi .
When I was writing that , I had it in my mind that Jubilee Street was another , more colourful street .
Then I was actually walking along it , looked up and went , ` Oh no , this is f -- ing Jubilee Street ' .
`` So let 's just say it 's a Jubilee Street of the imagination , '' he continued .
`` But I can say , in a rather lovely , serendipitous way , that the song reflects how Jubilee Street used to be before they regenerated it - a very sleazy down-at-heel place . ''
Cave explained during a Twitter Q&A with fans that the `` fetus on a leash '' line from this song is `` to do with rebirth . ''
John Hillcoat -LRB- The Road -RRB- directed the cinematic music video , which guest-stars actor Ray Winstone -LRB- The Departed -RRB- .
Hillcoat helmed 2005 's The Proposition from Cave 's script , which also starred Winstone .
