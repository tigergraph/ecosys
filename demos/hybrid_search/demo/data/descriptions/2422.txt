The actress/singer added that she worked with DioGuardi on her debut album but the pair finally got around to writing a song together for this set .
She explained : `` You know , we tried writing on the first -LSB- album -RSB- , but I was so new to it and I was just learning about myself as an artist .
I could tell I grew as an artist , not only in my vocal but also in my writing , because on the second -LSB- album -RSB- , when we got together ... and then we wrote a song together .
She definitely knows what she 's talking about .
She 's definitely a little headstrong and I am too .
I look up to her . ''
Ashley told OK magazine that on Guilty Pleasure , `` there 's a lot of break-up songs from stuff I experienced . ''
She added that this is the most personal one , and it , `` is about when you 're in a relationship and you say ` If I really needed you , would you actually be there ? ' ''
