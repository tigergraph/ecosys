This bar room groover finds White singing about a female stalker .
`` I got no truck with you woman , always coming over when I ai n't home , '' he complains .
White told NME he made up the lyrics on the spot .
`` This was the first song recorded for the album , '' he explained .
`` It was the first day , and it was just the vibe of it .
I wanted to get that vibe on and get that rhythm , and the words just kind of came out of that , playing live with all of those guys . ''
