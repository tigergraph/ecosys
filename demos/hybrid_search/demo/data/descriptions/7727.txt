Guitarist Mike Einziger came up with the song 's guitar part before the rest of it followed .
He told Rock Sound magazine : `` For me it sounds like a 1970 's version of our song ` Drive ' ; the working title of the song was ` Drive 1974 . '
It was a musical idea that I really felt strongly about , and I felt that it could turn into something great .
We were all listening to a lot of Phil Collins when we decided to put that song together , and the drums on ` Isadore ' were inspired by that . ''
Einziger discussed the track 's lyrical content with Rock Sound : `` The song really tells a story ; two people who are perhaps lovers , perhaps just close friends , and it 's a classic story of betrayal .
They go up into the sky in a hot air balloon , and one of them decides that they 're going to keep sailing , while the other decides to leave . ''
