We threw a party in the parking lot just to watch it fall . ''
The singer told Billboard magazine : `` Especially if you come from a small town , the least little thing that happens everybody shows up to check it out .
There 's something to be said when you hear a song for the first time , those visions pop into your head , and you can see it .
This is one of those songs . ''
