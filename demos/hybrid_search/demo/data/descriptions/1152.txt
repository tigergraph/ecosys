This electro-ballad features the anguished vocals of R&B singer Usher .
Guetta told Billboard magazine it 's `` maybe the biggest song I 've made in my life . ''
He added : `` We were in bargaining sessions for a while .
Usher was saying , ' I need this record for my album . '
I said , ` I 'm sorry , I can not give it to you . '
After a while he called me back and gave in . ''
Guetta and Usher knew each other before the French hitmaker broke in the States .
Said Guetta : `` I have to say that the very first time when someone big from America asked me if I want to work with him , it was Usher .
Like , a really long time ago , but we never had the time to do it .
So I was so happy to be finally in the studio with him , because he spotted me when I was really not famous yet . ''
Guetta told MTV News why he chose Usher to guest on this song .
`` It 's just totally emotional , '' he said .
`` Some of the record is a proper ballad , and then it goes to that crazy dance beat .
It 's perfect for him , because he 's famous for his ballads .
And he 's also now famous for those big club records that he comes with .
He 's an amazing dancer , so I felt like he was the artist that I needed . ''
Usher told MTV News that this ode to not giving up on love in the face of adversity resonated with him personally .
`` I think the world wanted a record like that .
That -LSB- song -RSB- really spoke to the journey that I 've actually been on in the last three years , '' he said .
`` Traveling all around the world , music sounds different .
There 's many different genres , and when you see R&B and pop and house , as well as electronic , come together , that 's the reality of what music is . ''
