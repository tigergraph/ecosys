Jim Collins and David Lee Murphy wrote this song about a couple riding a tractor on a date .
Collins appears to have a thing for penning `` tractor '' songs having previously co-written Kenny Chesney 's 1999 hit single `` She Thinks My Tractor 's Sexy . ''
This was Aldean 's third # 1 on the Country chart and his second successful chart-topper following `` She 's Country . ''
The song was the first to spend four weeks at # 1 since Brad Paisley 's `` Letter to Me '' reigned for four weeks 19 months previously in February 2008 .
David Lee Murphy , who had a successful solo career in the 1990s including the hits `` Party Crowd '' and `` Dust on the Bottle , '' told The Boot the story of the song : `` I live outside of Nashville .
I spend a lot of time out on my farm and on my tractor .
The night before -LSB- Jim and I -RSB- had gotten together to write , I was out bush-hogging .
One of my favorite things to do is get out and bush-hog at night and play around with my tractor .
I was out riding around one night , and I just got the idea for that song .
I started singing the chorus in my head.I was supposed to write with Jim the next day .
I walked into his office and I said , `` Hey man , do you feel like writing another tractor song ? ''
He just busted out laughing and said , `` It 's been about eight years since ` She Thinks My Tractor 's Sexy ' ... I think I 'm through ! ''
We sat down and wrote that song.When you write songs sometimes , you just have a feeling that `` this is going to be a hit song . ''
I had that feeling with ` Party Crowd , ' and I had that feeling with ` Dust on the Bottle . '
When we wrote ` Big Green Tractor , ' it just felt like , `` Man , this song feels really great .
It 's special and it 's different . ''
You just feel fortunate to be around when something like that happens .
Songwriters , we just sit around there and wait for the ideas to come .
Some days it does n't happen , and some days it does .
That was just one of those days that I was lucky enough to be there when that one came up . ''
Aldean commented in publicity materials with a grin : `` There 's nothin ' more romantic than a tractor .
If you live in South Georgia , a Saturday night out on the tractor with your girl is probably not that far-fetched of what could be considered a good ` date night . '
The song seems to be connecting already , so maybe tractors have always been romantic , and everybody just needed reminding . ''
The huge success of this song has caused a huge increase in attendance at Aldean 's concerts .
He commented to AOL 's The Boot : `` As an artist you look for a career-changing song and that was definitely one of those .
Now we 're seeing crowds of 8,000 to 9,000 where we were seeing 3,000 people .
` She 's Country ' changed a lot of things , but ` Tractor ' really changed it for me .
If someone had asked me which song on the album would have been that , I 'd never have picked ` Big Green Tractor . '
I loved the song and wanted it to be a single , but to have it do what it 's done , I 'd have never thought it .
Apparently there are a bunch of people who like to get freaky on a tractor ! ''
The song was originally pitched to Jake Owen but he passed on it .
