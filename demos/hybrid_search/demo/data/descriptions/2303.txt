This urban ballad was written by Lana Del Rey .
Cheryl Cole is a big fan of the `` Video Games `` singer and was interested to learn there were plenty of songs penned by her that she was n't planning on recording herself .
Speaking to Capital FM in June 2012 , Cole explained how she got to know Del Rey : `` I noticed Lana about a year ago , '' she said .
I was hearing these songs that were really fresh to my ear and amazing and I asked the guy who she was and he said , ` Watch out for her , it 's a girl called Lana Del Rey ' .
`` She continued : `` It all happened really organically just like that .
And then ` Video Games ' came out and I fell in love with her as an artist as well . ''
The song 's music video was directed by British photographer Rankin .
The clip shows Cole cuddling up and dancing with her boyfriend Tre Holloway .
Cole and the renowned snapper previously worked together on a promo for his magazine Hunger , which launched in 2011 .
