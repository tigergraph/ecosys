This is one of Hendrix ' most autobiographical and personal songs .
He hated talking about his past , and avoided it during press conferences and interviews .
Hendrix ' mother was a Cherokee Indian , and in this song he identifies with his heritage as a Native American .
The Red Hot Chili Peppers were all big fans of Jimi Hendrix and often perform this song live .
-LRB- thanks , Adrian - Gettysburg , PA -RRB- Hendrix played all of the lead guitar parts backwards , then rewound the recording of the lead guitar parts to the song to get that effect you hear in the beginning and in the middle of the song .
-LRB- thanks , Dane - Honolulu , HI , for above 2 -RRB- Hendrix read the words for this song as a poem instead of singing them .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France , for above 2 -RRB-
