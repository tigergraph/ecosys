This song is inspired by a couple who Pete knew in Australia .
He says that tragically the woman contracted terminal cancer and on the night of her funeral her partner was sitting on the bed staring out of the window when a butterfly flew through it and landed on his hand .
The reason why this was so poignant was because `` butterfly '' was the nickname the man used to give his partner .
Even stranger was that it was in the middle of winter , a time when you do not expect to see a butterfly .
The song is about coping with a loss such as this .
