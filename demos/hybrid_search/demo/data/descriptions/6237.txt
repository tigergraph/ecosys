The closing track to American electronic rock musical duo to Breathe Carolina 's third studio Hell Is What You Make It is a tribute to a close friend of the band , Lauren Freeman , who was tragically killed in a hit-and-run accident .
BC 's Kyle Evan told Alternative Addiction : `` She was more than a friend ; she was a sister to us , and this record would n't be what it is without her .
This song is meant to celebrate her life .
We know what it means to lose someone close ; hopefully , we can give you something to relate to if you 've had someone close to you taken by this thing we call life . ''
