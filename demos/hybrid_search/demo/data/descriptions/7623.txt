This was the last of 8 gold singles for Green .
This was released a week after Green 's girlfriend burst into his bathroom while he was taking a shower .
She poured boiling hot grits over him , then shot herself to death with his gun .
When Green was ordained the pastor of the Full Gospel Tabernacle Church two years later , this event was cited as the turning point of his life -LRB- Green claimed being born again the previous year , however -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , Brad Wind - Miami , FL , for above 2 -RRB-
