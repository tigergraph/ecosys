Lambert penned this Rock ballad with actress and singer Alisan Porter along with Ferras and Ely Rise .
Ferras performed `` Hollywood 's Not America , '' the exit song during the Hollywood Week for the 2008 series of American Idol .
Lambert told The Hollywood Reporter regarding the song 's meaning : `` It 's about being honest with yourself and the people you love .
We 've all been there where we 've been worried about that moment - whether it 's having a secret or something to overcome or get past - of chaos that happens right before you make the big step to fix it or to relieve yourself .
It 's a scary time , it 's uncertain , so that 's one of the things that I wrote the song about .
In my mind , it was about coming out and how scary a step that is .
And how once you do make the leap , you go , ` Wow , I feel liberated , there are other people like me , all I feel now is love ! '
Hopefully the message gets out there . ''
Lambert released a dance remix giving away a portion of the profits to raise the Trevor Project , a suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ youth .
Lambert told Rolling Stone about the song : '' ` Aftermath ' is probably the most Idol-esque type song on the album .
The cool thing is that the lyrics are basically about dealing with your demons .
I think there 's a universal message in it .
It might be about coming out , it might be about self-acceptance , taking the chance of keeping it real and doing what you feel in your heart you have to do , even though it 's scary , even though people might not like it .
It might be about going to AA .
Any sort of traumatic life moment , and in the aftermath of it , of making that decision and dealing with whatever it is you 're dealing with , you 'll find solace in it .
It 's another kind of empowerment-type anthem . ''
Lambert returned to American Idol on March 10 , 2011 to perform an acoustic version of the song .
