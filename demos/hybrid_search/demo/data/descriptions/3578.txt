Someone to Watch Over Me producer Steve Mac penned this song with his frequent songwriting partner Wayne Hector .
The two British hitmakers have been responsible for many of the singles recorded by the likes of Westlife , JLS and The Wanted .
They also co-wrote the track `` Proud '' from Boyle 's debut album I Dreamed a Dream .
Boyle explained the song 's meaning in publicity materials : `` It 's about people who have gone away .
It 's an emotional song and reflective as well because when you live without that other person it 's as though a part of you is away as well .
And although this song is very poetic and dramatic it also has those other connotations as well .
It 's very poignant . ''
