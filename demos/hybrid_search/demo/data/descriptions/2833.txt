The title of the song translated means `` Rose Red . ''
In the video we see the lead singer , Till , catch the eye of a lovely young lady .
Through the middle we see him doing her bidding because he is so hopelessly in love with her .
At the end , we see him murdering someone , apparently by the will of the lady -LRB- who here will be known as Rose , just for the sake of reference -RRB- .
As he comes out of the house of the victim , he sees Rose standing there with a smile .
Then suddenly , she points at him and yells , and the whole town comes to him and seizes him , then sets him aflame .
The song is basically about a man who spent so much of his life obsessing and bending his will to a woman , only to find out at the end it was n't worth it and got stabbed in the back .
Throughout the video , we see the members of the band standing in a circle , half naked , and whipping each other , implying that the lead singer in the story here is whipped by Rose .
-LRB- thanks , Joseph - LA , CA -RRB-
