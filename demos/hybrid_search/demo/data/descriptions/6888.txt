Pitbull opens this track by telling everyone he is `` reporting live from Cape Canaveral ' , ' before name-checking the song 's producer , Big Syphe , and launching into lyrics that describe his hometown of Miami .
The song was released to radio on March 26 , 2012 .
This is the first time that co-star Will Smith has not recorded the Men In Black theme himself .
His 1997 track `` Men in Black '' led the UK singles chart in the summer of 1997 , but was n't released as a single in the US so was n't eligible for a chart position .
Smith then recorded `` Black Suits Comin ' -LRB- Nod Ya Head -RRB- '' for Men in Black II in 2002 .
`` It 's an incredible honor to be a part of such an amazing franchise as Men In Black and I have so much respect for Will Smith , especially with our similar musical backgrounds , '' said Pitbull in a statement .
This samples Mickey & Sylvia 's 1956 tune `` Love Is Strange . ''
The female half of the duo , Sylvia Robinson , played an important part in rap 's breakthrough into the mainstream .
It was she who put together The Sugarhill Gang , who had the breakthrough Hip-Hop hit `` Rapper 's Delight '' in 1980 .
The guitar riff on both `` Love is Strange '' and this song was originated by the Blues musician Jody Williams .
The song serves as the theme tune for the sci-fi movie Men In Black 3 .
The Miami rapper got the job after director Barry Sonnenfeld 's daughter played him some of his music .
Said the director : `` My 19-year-old daughter turned me on to Pitbull .
I 'm thrilled that he wrote such a great song for our movie that totally gets it . ''
Pitbull raps , `` to understand the future we have to go back in time . ''
The song title serves as a reference to the movie 's plot in which Smith 's character Agent J must travel back in time in order to save his partner .
The Miami MC revealed that he `` used the slogan of the movie and flipped it back into the song that ` in order to understand the future , you have to go back in time ' . ''
The song 's music video was filmed on the actual Men in Black 3 set , and it blends Pitbull 's performance shots with scenes from the film .
`` As far as the sets that you see right now , it 's just integrating and running parallel with everything that you see in the movie , '' Pitbull explained to MTV News .
