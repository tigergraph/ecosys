In December 2006 , The Scissor Sisters appeared on Jools Holland 's Later music program on BBC2 where they performed this song .
Earlier in the program , frontman Jake Shears said the track was inspired by a dream he had about meeting McCartney in which he and the ex-Beatle had a conversation about song writing .
Apart from the title , the song does n't mention McCartney at all .
