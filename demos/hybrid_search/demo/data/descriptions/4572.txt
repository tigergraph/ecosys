The first single from The Script 's third album was recorded in Los Angeles and features will.i.am .
Frontman Danny O'Donoghue decided to hook up with The Black Eye Pea after the pair worked together as coaches on The Voice UK .
O'Donoghue explained to The Sun : `` I played Will a few demos backstage early on in The Voice .
We got to ` Hall Of Fame ' and he immediately asked if he could have it for his new album , as it was exactly what he was looking for .
I was n't having it , it was our lead single but I asked if he 'd be on it .
He agreed and we booked in time to record it .
The problem is , he 's either late or completely flakes , so it took four attempts to get him to record his part .
`` The Irish singer added : `` Eventually we put it together in his hotel room in 15 minutes .
It 's a classic duet , I do one line and he responds .
We 're really excited about it and hoping we 'll get out and do it live too . ''
This was the Script 's first UK # 1 single , bettering the # 2 peak of 2008 's `` The Man Who Ca n't Be Moved . ''
Speaking with SoundSpike , O'Donoghue explained the title of the album means a lot more than just being the band 's third record .
`` I was born the third of October , '' he said .
`` We recorded it in studio three .
This is our third album .
There 's this energy .
I live in flat three .
The symbol three if you turn it around , it 's an E and E 's the most commonly used letter in the English language .
It 's a crazy symbol .
We changed all the Es to 3s on our album sleeve .
We said , `` Oh my god , they 're everywhere . ''
Another successful musical collaboration born out of two artists meeting as judges on The Voice was `` Moves Like Jagger . ''
Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine teamed up with Christina Aguilera for the song after working with her on the first US series of the singing talent contest .
O'Donoghue said regarding the song 's meaning : `` It 's a really inspirational song about not following money , not following the things that ` music ' would be believe is important -- like red carpets and this that and the other .
It 's about following your heart . ''
