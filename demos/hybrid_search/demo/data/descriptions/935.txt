The Crying Light 's album cover is a photograph taken by Naoya Ikegami in 1977 of Antony ' Hegarty 's hero , 102-year-old Japanese dancer Kazuo Ohno .
Hegarty explained to The Sun newspaper .
`` He 's the founder of Butoh dance , my art hero .
I get a lot of ideas from him .
He did his master work as a solo dancer between the ages of 75 and 95 .
He 's a bit catatonic now and does n't really dance any more .
He 's about 80 in the cover picture .
It was a poster I got when I was 16 .
I had it for years above my bed before I knew who it was . ''
Antony Hegarty named his Johnsons after ill-fated transgender activist and performer Marsha P Johnson , who met her death drowning in the Hudson River .
