English Post-Punk group Savages open their debut album with this track , which establishes the idea of ` silencing yourself ' in order to gain some focus in the cacophony of modern life .
The artistic statement `` You are distracted .
You are available '' is printed on the cover of Silence Yourself .
The same manifesto is read aloud in this song 's video by singer Jehnny Beth .
The song opens with an excerpt from the John Cassavetes ' 1977 movie Opening Night , which is about a Broadway actress coming to terms with getting older .
The clip was used at the suggestion of co-producer Johnny Hostile .
