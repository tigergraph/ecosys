This song was written by Joey Burns , who is the frontman for the Tucson band Calexico .
In 2000 , Calexico recorded a song Burns wrote called `` Ballad of Cable Hogue , '' which was titled after a 1970 film of that name .
Shortly thereafter , they met Lee Hazlewood , who told them the song reminded him of a duet he did with Nancy Sinatra called `` Summer Wine . ''
A few years later , Burns learned that Nancy was looking for songs for her 2004 album , so he wrote `` Burnin ' Down the Spark '' for her .
He wrote the song in New York City on the Fourth of July , 2003 .
Burns put himself in Nancy 's mindset , thinking about what it would be like looking over a city her father influenced in so many ways .
`` It 's about chasing down that love you have for someone , '' Burns told us .
`` The only thing Nancy said was , ` Can you re-record it and I 'll sing on top of it ?
Can you transpose it to a different key ? '
And I said , ` No problem . '
So it was so easy to work with her .
And then a couple of years later we were performing at The Getty Museum in Los Angeles and she came to the show .
She loved it and we breakfast together - she bought the whole band breakfast .
It was with her daughter A.J. .
It was really cool .
So it was a very special time to get to meet her and since then I 've followed what she 's been doing .
She 's great .
She 's very true to some of her causes , like performing for troops and veterans of the Vietnam War .
That 's something I really admire about someone of that caliber : she 's still really connected and grounded . ''
