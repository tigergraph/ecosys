This song with a promise to lead the listener out into the big wide world was written by guitarist Gem Archer .
He told Q magazine October 2008 : `` It was just a groove , a bassline and Noel was like ` that 's the one , write some words for it ' .
It 's a stream of consciousness .
And there 's no guitars on it which is another thing I like as well . ''
This was played live for the first time on August 26 , 2008 at the WaMu Theater in Seattle .
The album title comes from a lyric on this song .
