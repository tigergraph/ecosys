This was the third single from Britney Spears ' debut album , ... Baby One More Time .
Britney played a waitress in the song 's music video .
She told MTV News : `` Actually , the concept of the video is all my idea '' The young singer added that she thought `` it would be cool to be in a club , and we 're dorky waitresses , and we break out and start dancing . ''
Like Britney 's ... Baby One More Time , this song was written and produced by Max Martin .
Spears told MTV News in 1998 that she thought it was an extension of her debut hit .
She said : `` It 's an uptempo -LRB- song -RRB- .
Kinda like ' ... Baby One More Time , ' same feel a little .
A bit of rock in it . ''
The song featured on the soundtrack of the romantic comedy film , Drive Me Crazy .
Melissa Joan Hart and Adrian Grenier reprised their roles from the movie in the video .
Nigel Dick , who directed the promo told MTV News that it was a struggle to convince Grenier to make an appearance in it .
`` The big issue is that Adrian Grenier did not want to be in the video , '' he said .
`` So , I was given instructions to ring him up and make sure he appeared in the video .
I said , ` You know what , Adrian , I just think it would be great for your career , and Britney 's a great girl and she 's fun to work with . '
Eventually he came around . ''
