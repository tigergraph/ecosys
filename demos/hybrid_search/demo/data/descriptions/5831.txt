` The Light and the Sea ' began with the notion of the sea god Poseidon , but became a meditation on retaining a moral compass , `` she explained .
`` As I get older , my big struggle is n't being virtuous and moral , it 's more about what I do in chaos , '' Williams added .
`` When I 'm stressed out , I say and do terrible things .
There 's a light to follow , and you can lose it in chaos . ''
