This is a track from David Bowie 's 1969 eponymous album , which was released in the US as Man of Words/Man of Music .
It was later rereleased by RCA as Space Oddity but reverted to the original , eponymous , title for a 2009 reissue .
George Underwood designed the back cover art for the Space Oddity release as well as Bowie 's other early albums .
The artist was a friend of the singer back in his childhood days in the South East England town of Bromley .
He told Q magazine April 2013 that Bowie based this observational tale , `` on a story , not specifically about his mother , but a Bromley woman caught shoplifting . ''
