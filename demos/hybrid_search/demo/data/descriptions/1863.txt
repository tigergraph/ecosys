Bruce Springsteen performed this on the Today show , September 28 , 2007 .
To introduce this song , he said : `` This is a song called ` Livin ' In the Future . '
But it 's really about what 's happening now .
Right now .
It 's kind of about how the things we love about America , cheeseburgers , French fries , the Yankees battlin ' Boston , the Bill of Rights , v-twin motorcycles , Tim Russert 's haircut , trans-fats and the Jersey Shore .
We love those things the way womenfolk love on Matt Lauer .
But over the past six years we 've had to add to the American picture : rendition , illegal wiretapping , voter suppression , no habeus corpus , the neglect of that great city New Orleans and its people , an attack on the Constitution .
And the loss of our best men and women in a tragic war .
This is a song about things that should n't happen here happening here .
So right now we plan to do something about it , we plan to sing about it .
I know it 's early -LRB- in the morning -RRB- , but it 's late .
So come and join us . ''
