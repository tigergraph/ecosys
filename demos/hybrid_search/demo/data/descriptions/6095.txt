Seth Lakeman told the Daily Mirror July 3 , 2008 about this track : `` We did it in one take .
It 's a ghostly story about a rich lady , Lady Howard from Tavistock , coming to visit a guy who makes love to her , takes her money and kills her .
But she haunts him for the rest of his life .
I 've got a fascination for a good story .
I always have a good narrative .
I do research , but I 'm not always bound by facts .
I just like a good story - whether it 's true or not . ''
