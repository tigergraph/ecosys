Stone told VH1 that this song is about finding happiness through music : `` When I was in school , I wanted to be a singer and everyone said I was crazy .
They 'd be like , ` Get your head out of those clouds and come do your math work . '
So now I 'm telling them , ` Girl , they wo n't believe it , I finally found some sweet through the bitters of life .
All I need is a kiss from a melody . ''
