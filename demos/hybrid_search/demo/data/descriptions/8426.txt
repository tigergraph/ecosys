This track from Suck It And See contains some of Alex Turner 's strangest lyrics .
He told NME : `` This is one where I definitely think the words are taking a backseat .
It 's just about chaos .
Like , all the sound of it -- all the music and guitars and drums -- everything 's just barmy and I 'm trying to make the lyrics subscribe to that as well .
Do I ever do that William Burroughs thing where you cut words up and arrange them randomly ?
No , I never actually do it physically but maybe in my head a little bit .
We recorded it one day like really hungover and had a great day .
It were a really good hangover , like a giddy one . ''
The Monkeys opened the May 13 , 2011 episode of Later With Jools Holland with a performance of this song .
The band settled on Suck It And See as the album title after a lot of debating .
One of the alternatives they came up with was ` The Thunder-Suckle Fuzz Canyon , ' which found its way into this song .
Turner explained to NME : `` We were trying to think of album titles all the time when we were in LA / As a sort of exercise to try and stumble across something we thought we 'd try and name something else and then steal that as our album title .
So you know fuzz pedals for guitars ?
They usually have quite colourful names .
So we were trying to think of fuzz pedal names in the hope it would lead us to an album title .
So we got a load of them like the ` The Thunder-Suckle Fuzz Canyon ' , which is a lyric that did finally get in there .
It 's right before I play a guitar solo .
It goes , ` We 're going riding through the Thunder-suckle Fuzz Canyon ' and then does a countdown to lift-off . ''
