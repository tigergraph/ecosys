Artist Direct asked lead singer Lacey Mosley about the story behind this song .
She replied : `` I love ` This Close ' the more that I listen to it .
It 's fitting because I 'm going through a completely new season in my life where I do n't know who I am anymore -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
A lot of things that I held on to and had convictions about are shifting .
I realized I 've been judgmental in certain areas and I have to soften up about them .
It 's not that the convictions are changing , but the striving to control is changing -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
I 'm not going to try to control the circumstances around me like I felt I needed to before .
It 's a really relieving feeling to know that God 's in control and we 're not .
Sometimes it means our hands are off .
You make decisions that you think with all of your heart are right , move forward and then you find out that they 're wrong in the end .
That will really shake your sense of your own identity .
You have to clean up a bunch of mess , deal with the aftermath , give it all to God and say , ` Please heal my heart and teach me the difference between right and wrong . '
That 's where we get tripped up the most -- really believing in a heart that can be deceptive sometimes .
If you 've ever had your heart broken , your heart will sometimes deceive you and make you blind and foolish .
In the end , you have to be honest and say , ' I do n't know who I am anymore . '
Admitting you do n't know anything is the closest you 'll ever get to being real -LSB- Laughs -RSB- . ''
