This simple , fun cut is the second single and title track from American Country artist Randy Houser 's sophomore record .
The song , which was originally penned by Houser in the mid 2000s , spotlights the way a woman can make a man feel and he specifically recorded it to be a single from the album .
Houser told The Boot why this was chosen as a single : `` Mostly my promotion team at the record label selected it .
We had just done a merger with Toby Keith 's label , so it 's ShowDog Universal now .
We 're working with a brand new team , so we really wanted something they believed in .
So they heard a demo of ` I 'm All About It , ' and we went and recorded it .
They said , ` We can get this on all the radio stations . '
We had just come off a single that did n't work , ` Whistlin ' Dixie , ' which I loved and still think should have been a big hit .
So at this point , I was like , ` Okay , let 's record it .
If you guys really think this is a hit song , we need it . '
The thing is , I need radio to play my music so I have work !
I really love the song .
It 's a great summer song , it 's uptempo and it sounds good on the radio . ''
