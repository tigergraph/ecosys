Trent Reznor announced in February 2013 that he was re-forming Nine Inch Nails to tour .
The previous few years he 'd been concentrating on film scoring and his other band How To Destroy Angels .
Four months later the band revealed that they 'd been doing a whole lot more than just gigging when they announced their eighth studio album , Hesitation Marks .
`` I 've been less than honest about what I 've really been up to lately , '' said Reznor .
`` For the last year I 've been secretly working non-stop with Atticus Ross and Alan Moulder on a new , full-length Nine Inch Nails record , which I am happy to say is finished . ''
This bouncy , electric track was released as the first single from the project .
The album title is a reference to small wounds inflicted during self-harm .
The song , Nine Inch Nail 's first single since 2008 's `` Discipline '' finds Reznor singing `` I said goodbye .
But I had to try . ''
The lyrics are presumably a reference to his activities during the band 's hiatus .
The song 's music video was directed by David Lynch and released on June 28 , 2013 , with an epileptic seizure warning .
Nine Inch Nails and the director have crossed paths before .
In 1997 , Reznor produced the soundtrack to the David Lynch film Lost Highway and the release spawned the band 's single `` The Perfect Drug . ''
`` I 'm a huge David Lynch fan -- we used to hold up Nine Inch Nails shows just so we could watch the latest Twin Peaks , '' Reznor told Rolling Stone in 1997 .
