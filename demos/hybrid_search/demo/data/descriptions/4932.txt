This song finds Sexsmith expressing gratitude for being Canadian .
He explained to CBC Music : `` This is just about how lucky I feel to have been born and raised in Canada .
With the whole world seeming to be constantly growing insane , either with extreme weather or extreme horribleness , like in Syria , for example , you watch the news and think , wow , I 'm so lucky to be living in this seemingly sane country .
We have our own problems here too , but it was just about that and also , how it 's amazing we can just go about our business when all that craziness is going on . ''
