This is a track from New York alternative rock band The Bravery 's third studio album , Stir The Blood .
Vocalist Sam Endicott told Billboard magazine `` I 'd say it 's more like the first record -LRB- in 2005 -RRB- in that there 's a lot of electronics on it , but it still sounds very human .
It 's also like the first record in that it 's a party album .
It 's uptempo , fun music , although it does have a range of things . ''
The Bravery started working up songs for Stir The Blood in an abandoned church in rural upstate New York , which years ago housed the B52 's as they recorded `` Love Shack . ''
The group then hooked up with co-producer John Hill -LRB- M.I.A. , Santigold -RRB- in Manhattan .
Endicott told Billboard : `` He taught us a lot of ways to manipulate synthesizers and guitars in a way that we had never done before , so the album sounds spacier . ''
This song was penned by the band 's bass player Mike Hindert .
Endicott commented to Billboard that it `` sounds like a '50s ballad or something . ''
