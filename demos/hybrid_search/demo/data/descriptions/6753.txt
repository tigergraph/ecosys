This melancholy song was written and recorded by Dido on to her laptop , at home .
She plays every instrument on the track , including the drums .
The singer songwriter told the Los Angeles Times November 18 , 2008 that she gained a great deal of confidence in her own ability to play and record on different instruments whilst working on Safe Trip Home with producer Jon Brion in LA. .
When she returned to London , thinking that the album was completed Dido found that she could n't stop writing .
The English multi-instrumentalist recalled : `` I went home , and I had all my instruments around , and I now knew how to record and work all the computer programs and everything , and how to engineer it , and ended up basically doing a whole album 's worth of stuff on my own at home , from what I 'd learned . ''
The initial plan was to keep these new efforts to herself , but after she played them to her brother Rollo , from the electronic music group Faithless , he encouraged her to complete the songs .
As a result this one and several others appear on Safe Trip Home .
Dido explained the meaning of this tune to Canada.com : `` A very personal song about being close to someone who is depressed and wo n't admit it .
It 's the hollow feeling of being with someone without actually being with them , if that makes sense . ''
