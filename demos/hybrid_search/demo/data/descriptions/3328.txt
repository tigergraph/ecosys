Joan as Police Woman is a New York trio made up of frontwoman Joan Wasser together with bassist Rainy Orteca and drummer Parker Kindred .
Their name comes from a friend 's assertion that Wasser looked like Angie Dickinson in 1970s cop show Policewoman .
Wasser was Jeff Buckley 's girlfriend when he drowned in Wolf River , Tennessee , in 1997 .
He wrote `` Everybody Here Wants You '' from his posthumous Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk album as a love song for her .
This song addresses Joan Wasser 's need to move forward after the frontwoman lost her mother to cancer .
She explained to the Independent newspaper June 6 , 2008 : '' ` To Survive ' is spoken from her point of view .
Part of it 's a lullaby - imagining her singing to me as I 'm going to sleep , and feeling regular childhood fears , of the darkness . ''
