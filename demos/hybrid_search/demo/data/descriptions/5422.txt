This song is the 90th single of Country music artist George Strait 's career and the third single from his album Twang .
Written by Blaine Larsen , Jim Lauderdale , and Jimmy Ritchey , it is an upbeat song about a guy wanting to romance his lover .
When this reached # 9 on Billboard 's top Country songs list , Strait became the first act to hit the top 10 on any Billboard chart every year for 30 consecutive years .
It was his 82nd top 10 country hit .
Singer-songwriter Blaine Larsen has had a successful career as a recording artist , including `` How Do You Get That Lonely , '' which reached # 91 on the Hot 100 in 2004 .
Surprisingly , this was the first song he wrote that was covered by someone else .
He recalled on his website : `` I found out George had cut it on a Friday morning while driving in my truck .
I remember pulling over on the side of the road and crying like a baby .
Having George Strait cut my song - that 's done .
Nothing or no one can take that away .
That 's something I 'll be telling my grandkids . ''
Larsen told The Boot that writing this cut came easy : `` It was one of those songs that just fell out of the sky , '' he said .
`` I wrote it with two other guys - Jim Lauderdale and Jimmy Ritchey , who also produces my records .
We went over to Jimmy 's house to write this song , and we 're sitting around his kitchen table , where he 's written a bunch of hits already .
And he had the title and the guitar lick , and we sat down to write it .
I think we wrote it in two hours , including lunch . ''
