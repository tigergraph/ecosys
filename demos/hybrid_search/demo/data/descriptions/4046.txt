While it sounds like this could be a romance song , it was actually written at a time when lead singer Craig Owens wanted to quit Chiodos .
In a podcast with Alternative Press , Owens said it was just as they were about to be signed and two of their members left .
They later got Derrick Frost and Jason Hale to replace them .
Owens wrote the song because he thought he `` could n't do this anymore and because it was a difficult time for Chiodos 'cause two of the members left . ''
