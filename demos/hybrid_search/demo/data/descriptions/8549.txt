This is a previously unreleased recording , which Grant originally penned during her rocky first marriage to Gary Chapman .
They eventually divorced in 1999 and Grant explained to The Boot why she waited till now to record the song .
Said the singer : '' ` Come Into My World ' is the rawest , most vulnerable -LSB- song -RSB- and it just required a lot of distance from that time in my life .
I wrote that in the years prior to going through a divorce , but it was before anybody knew there was trouble .
I felt like I was living this absolute total facade and so the song is really a downer ... I had n't actually heard it in over a decade , and I was moved by it and thought ` wow , I remember how that felt . '
Thank goodness I do n't feel that way now , but that is a very real feeling for a lot of people at different times in life . ''
