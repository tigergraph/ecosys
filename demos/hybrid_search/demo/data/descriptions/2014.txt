Ever since The Beatles gave fuel to the `` Paul is dead '' rumors when it was claimed their track `` Revolution 9 '' featured a voice saying `` Turn me on , dead man '' if played backwards , rock stars have been accused of leaving subliminal messages on their records .
Sometimes , as in the case of Pink Floyd jokey utterance on `` Empty Spaces , '' they really did make remarks .
On other occasions , there are doubts whether anything was actually said .
The issue came to a head when the mother of a Nevada teenager who killed himself in 1985 sued Judas Priest , claiming that their song `` Better By You Better Than Me , '' contained subliminal messages which compelled him to commit suicide .
Another similar case in the same era involved the Ozzy Osbourne track `` Suicide Solution , '' when a teenage American named John McCullom shot himself while listening to the tune on his headphones .
His parents sued Ozzy , claiming this song compelled him to kill himself.Both cases were eventually dismissed .
This minor-key crawler is the Black Lips sarcastic tribute to that era .
Singer-guitarist Cole Alexander told Spinner about the pop star 's reaction to getting the `` Mad Dog '' treatment . ''
-LSB- Our producer -RSB- Mark Ronson called me 'cause he showed her the song and she liked it but she was a little weirded out about it , '' he said .
The song features some rousing saxophone by Cochemea Gastelum .
The soul/Afro-beat musician has toured and recorded with the likes of Paul Simon , The Roots , Public Enemy , and Amy Winehouse .
He 's also performed as a member of the band of the Broadway musical Fela ! .
The Black Lips borrowed from one of Ke $ ha 's tunes for their experiment , singing her song forwards but then playing it backwards -LRB- ` Mad Dog ; backwards is ` God Dam ' -RRB- .
So why did the band choose Ke $ ha ?
Apparently she used to come to the band 's shows as her ex-boyfriend 's band , Cheap Time , used to frequently play with The Black Lips .
