This song is about attending funeral and being buried .
The lyrics make a few clever references to it Even from the opening line of `` All dressed up with nowhere to go/Walking with a dead man over my shoulder . ''
Later Danny Elfman sings , `` Got my best suit and my tie , Shiny silver dollar on either eye , I hear the chauffeur comin ' to the door , Says there 's room for maybe just one more ... '' Being dressed in his best suit refers to the tradition of dressing the dead in their finest clothes , the silver dollars were once used to weight the eyelids closed , and the dead would pay the ferryman to cross the River Styx from Greek mythology.The chauffeur saying there is room for one more refers to campfire horror story were a man is woken up in the night by a car honking and as he looks out the window .
He sees six of his friends in the car dressed in suits , the driver then tells the man that there is room for one more .
Later the man tells a friend the story before dying in car wreck and the friend believes the man had predicted his own death .
