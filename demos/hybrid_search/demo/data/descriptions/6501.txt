This overtly confessional song of gratitude to his wife , the actress Nicole Kidman , is the one song on Defying Gravity where Urban addresses the difficulties he encountered in the early days of his marriage .
These included some time in rehab after backsliding in a long struggle with substance abuse .
Urban said on the Roughstock site that this was written on the first day that he wrote with Rick Nowels .
He added : `` When I got to the studio , Rick played me various pieces of music .
He got to this piano chord progression and a little drum beat and I just loved the mood of the music and started writing the lyric .
I really feel that I have been given a life by someone who 's loved me in a way I 've never been loved before .
This was my way of saying ` Thank you . ' ''
Urban co-wrote this song with Rick Nowels in London as Kidman was shooting the movie Nine there .
He told USA Today that Nowels ' music `` pulled this story out of me , which became quite a confessional - much more intimate than I might have written had I intended to write about -LRB- her -RRB- .
It was very instinctual and very much from the heart .
We did a quick recording of it , and I took it home and played it for her that night .
I think she was very , you know , touched . ''
Urban told Country Music TV why he recorded this song quickly : `` I think the important thing with that song was to not belabor it too long .
Capturing those things in their real form is the most important thing , not worrying about all the other stuff .
That 's hard to talk about that stuff .
It 's not meant to be talked about .
It 's meant to be played and people take from it what they want .
But it 's something I wanted to be able to do for my wife , too .
She 's been an incredible strength for me .
In the last couple of years , particularly so . ''
