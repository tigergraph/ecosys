Georgia-raised , Nashville-based singer-songwriter Jessie James composed her first song on a plastic guitar at the age of 9 .
After Mercury Records President David Massey got to hear a demo , he and Island/Def Jam CEO Antonio `` L.A. '' Reid arranged a live audition for James at their HQ in New York .
They liked what they heard and the country-pop singer was given a major record deal by the label .
James ' first break came when her song `` Blue Jeans '' was featured on the trailer for the movie Confessions of a Shopaholic .
This dance rock song was the first single from Jessie James ' self-titled debut album .
James told Artist Direct that this song is , `` about wanting to be wanted by one particular guy .
It talks about being sexy in a classy way .
The song came together really fast . ''
James co-wrote this with American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi .
The other co-writers are Mitch Allen -LRB- Faith Hill , Daughtry -RRB- and David Hodges -LRB- Kelly Clarkson , Evanescence -RRB- .
Allen also produced the track .
James explained to SingerUniverse Magazine that `` Massey thought it would be a great idea to hook me up on the pop end with Kara DioGuardi . ''
She added : `` The meeting with her , Mitch and David was my first in L.A. after I got signed .
She 's the real deal and what you see is what you get with her .
Like she is on American Idol , she 's feisty , ballsy , opinionated ... and freakishly talented . ''
