Marsha Ambrosius of the English Neo-Soul duo Floetry wrote this ballad when she was still at school .
She and her Floetry colleague Natalie Stewart both attended the Brit School for Performing Arts & Technology .
They met Jackson through John McClain , DreamWorks 's senior urban executive who also manages Jackson .
Jacko heard this song and decided he wanted to record it .
Ambrosius told VH1 that Stewart had a dream that the two girls were in a limo with Michael .
She continued , `` He was singing a song and it was like , ` Oh , I like that song . '
A year later , we 're in the studio cutting ` Butterflies ' with Michael Jackson . ''
Michael Jackson has said that this is his favorite song on the album .
Jackson invited the two Floetry girls to the studio to the studio , and asked for their input on the recording of the song .
Natalie Stewart of Floetry told Yahoo : `` It was incredible because he asked , he continually , asked , ` Marsh , what 's the next harmony ?
Girls , does this sound right ?
What do you think ?
Is this what you were looking for ?
He was so open .
`` Marsha Ambrosius told Yahoo that it took a few minutes for her to calm down .
She recalled : `` To begin with , I was kinda shook .
Because you do n't realize how you 're going to feel until you 're put in that kind of situation .
I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous .
But as I got into it , I realized it was work , it was a job .
I had to vocally conduct a legend . ''
A year after this appeared on Invincible , Floetry 's original version was included as a bonus track on the English version of their debut album Floetic .
