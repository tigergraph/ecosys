This was an outtake from the band 's 2003 album Magic and Medicine .
Frontman James Skelly explained on his record label 's website why it was n't originally included on the album : `` I think it was the one the record company wanted to release as a single but at the time we did n't want them to do that , but it 's a good song when you listen back .
At the time I thought it was a bit too much of a pastiche of a soul tune but now I see in the right context its great . ''
