Jessie J 's first single from her sophomore album was penned by the singer with American songwriter Claude Kelly .
Known as the `` Studio Beast , '' Kelly scored his career breakthrough when he co-wrote Frankie J 's 2006 `` Daddy 's Little Girl '' single , which failed to chart .
However , despite its lack of commercial success , the song helped him land a deal with Warner/Chappell Music .
His work so impressed Akon that in late 2007 , the American - Senegalese singer-producer asked Kelly to pen songs for him , as well as artists he was working with such as Leona Lewis -LRB- `` Forgive Me '' -RRB- .
Kelly has since written songs for such acts as Christina Aguilera , Kelly Clarkson , Miley Cyrus , Adam Lambert , and Britney Spears , as well as co-penning Jessie J 's hit single `` Price Tag . ''
This was produced by American musician Ammo , who is signed to Dr. Luke 's publishing company Prescription Songs as a producer and songwriter .
The song features two heavyweight rappers , the Godfather of UK Grime , Dizzee Rascal , and Def Jam MC Big Sean .
Jessie J told Capital Radio that she wanted someone `` really British '' and `` really American '' in terms of guests .
`` We wrote the song and I actually had a middle eight , '' she explained , `` and I said to Claude Kelly , who 's the executive producer on this album , ' I feel like this should have a rapper on it ' and I was like ` how about two ? ' ''
Jessie told MTV UK that the song was inspired by her fans .
`` It 's about when there 's people trying to bring you down and pour water over your fire and dim your light , '' she explained .
`` It 's about having your fans , they 're like your army , and you 're the person at the front that 's just about to go to battle and without your soldiers you feel unsafe out there .
They 're my heartbeats , the things that keep me feeling like I can do this . ''
