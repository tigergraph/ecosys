Birmingham , England native Clare Maguire is a singer-songwriter who specializes in torch ballads with soul , blues , and Celtic influence .
Singing and writing music from the age of seven , after she posted demos on MySpace every UK and US major label courted her signature .
Eventually Maguire signed a deal with Universal Music Group and this ethereal love song , which was released on October 18 , 2010 , is her debut single .
Maguire told Artist Direct about this tune : `` It 's a very mysterious and passionate song ; it 's the most ethereal on the album .
To be honest , all of the other songs are a lot more straightforward lyrically .
This one is definitely a bit otherworldly .
`` She added , regarding the song 's meaning : `` It 's really about passion and a deep yearning for somebody .
I did n't want it to be too straightforward .
I wanted it to have that open , desert-y feeling , which is why I incorporated guitar .
It 's an epic love song . ''
The song was produced by Fraser T Smith , who manned the boards on # 1 hits for Tinchy Stryder and Taio Cruz .
The song 's music video was directed by Sam Brown whose CV also includes the controversial MVA-winning clip for Jay Z 's `` On To The Next One . ''
Maguire told Artist Direct that she had a big say in the planning of the video .
Said the singer : `` I said what I wanted , and a few different directors brought me back their ideas .
Sam did exactly what I was thinking though .
We had this discussion about it and then went from there .
It was great because he captured precisely what I wanted for that song .
I want my music videos to really capture the songs . ''
