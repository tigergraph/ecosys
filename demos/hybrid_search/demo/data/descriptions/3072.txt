This is a track from the California melodic hardcore band Far 's fifth studio album , At Night We Live .
The band comprises frontman Jonah Matranga , guitarist Shaun Lopez , bassist John Gutenberger and drummer Chris Robyn .
After splitting in 1999 , the group got together again in 2008 to play a handful of dates .
The following year they signed a deal with Vagrant and recorded this record , their first since 1998 's Water & Solutions .
Matranga told Spinner UK : `` When I wrote the chorus for ` Give Me a Reason , ' it was the first thing that really got us excited about making this record .
We wanted to make sure it was n't just going to be another lazy reunion album , and this song was a spark that let us know we still had something to say as a band . ''
Matranga told the story of the song in publicity materials : `` The demo was called ` Busy Beat . '
Shaun wrote a beat that I love , so I wrote a bouncy verse and I love the way the chorus came together .
Lyrically , it 's an homage to a Robert Plant solo song , ` In The Mood . '
`` Lopez added : `` This is the second song I wrote when I was trying to be in a Water & Solutions mindset .
That was my least favorite song when I wrote the music .
It reminded me of a rip off of Far , of myself .
Jonah sent it back and I do like it now .
I was writing that song for Jonah . ''
