This was originally a song called `` Casino Blues '' that frontman Ben Gibbard played on solo dates with David Bazan in 2007 .
The Open Door EP features four songs that were recorded during the Narrow Stairs sessions that were eventually cut , plus a demo version of `` Talking Bird '' with just Gibbard singing and playing the ukelele .
Bassist Nick Harmer said to MTV News of the four original tracks : `` It 's not like they 're castoffs or anything ; they 're part of the Narrow Stairs experience .
They needed to have a proper home , and the EP is it . ''
