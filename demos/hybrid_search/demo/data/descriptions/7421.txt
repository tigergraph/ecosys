Also featured on the tune is the national instrument of Puerto Rico , the cuatro , which is a Latin American three stringed guitar .
Ricky Martin -LRB- from Billboard magazine -RRB- : `` On the one hand you have the tropical aspect : Puerto Rico , the cuatro as an instrument and the use of the clave in this song .
And it also speaks of kids who live on the streets , who are seduced by it by guns , or drugs , and it 's about me trying to be their ally , wanting to listen to the pain inside their young souls . ''
