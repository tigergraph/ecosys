This is my favorite song on the whole record .
Hands down , bar none .
Also recorded demo to a cassette .
When Play was released , I did n't think anyone was gon na listen to it .
So I figured towards the end , I will put on the songs that I like .
No one 's gon na listen to this record , certainly no one 's ever gon na get this far in the record .
Track 15 or whatever ?
So I put it on there for myself .

There was no looking back now ... '' Since Jethro Tull at this time was still in London having a hard time getting a gig , this makes Andy Kulberg of The Blues Project the first electric flautist of note .
