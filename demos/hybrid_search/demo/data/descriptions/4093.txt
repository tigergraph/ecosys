When this was first released many people thought The Cure had ripped off the sound of New Order 's `` Blue Monday . ''
Though many fingers were pointed at The Cure , no actions were ever taken due to the fact that this was written and recorded before , but released after `` Blue Monday . ''
The likeness between the two was proven to be nothing more than coincidence .
This was the first Cure song to enter the UK top 20 , and it put unprecedented pressures on the band for commercial success .
In a 1983 interview with the Italian magazine Rockerilla , vocalist and primary lyricist Robert Smith said : `` There was so much pressure around ` The Walk ' because it went in the charts and now everyone wants another single .
We must resist this temptation , I 'm tired of being bound to the same group of people , the same music area .
People do n't understand why we split up , since this would be the ideal moment to take advantage of three years of incessant touring .
Everyone was saying that our next album would be the definitive one , but we decided to call it quits without reaching our initial goals . ''
There have been several versions of this track .
The band re-recorded it for their 1990 remix album Mixed up , as the original master tapes had been lost .
They also recorded an acoustic version for their 2001 Greatest Hits album , which included a bonus disc featuring exclusively acoustic renderings of their songs .
