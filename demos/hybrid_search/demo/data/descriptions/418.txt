This quirky heartbreak single from the British singer Kate Nash 's third album finds her so distraught that she ca n't even enjoy the simple pleasures in life , like free drinks and dolphin kisses .
Her mood is so dour that she ca n't even receive vitamin D from the sun , putting her at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and rickets .
Nash wrote the song while on vacation , which might explain the lyric about writing postcards to the object of her obsession .
The video was directed by Aram Rappaport , who also made a movie called Syrup in 2013 .
The clip features a group of synchronized swimmers .
