At 7:32 , this is the longest track on any of Wild Beasts first three albums , making this one of the band 's less accurate song titles .
Bassist Tom Fleming discussed the song in an interview with Drowned in Sound : `` Where we stitched together all the Reich repetitions , the Ronnie harmonies and the Oneohtrix swells that we had been doing for the weeks in our industrial basement .
We were persuaded into keeping this to seven minutes , when we play it live it will be somewhere between seven and seventy .
We were thinking MBV 's holocaust section , but gentler , and rising .
I had just seen Swans , and got -LRB- 1985 piano composition -RRB- ` For Bunita Marcus . '
so we 've got acquainted with having patience , but this has as much to do with the Cocteau Twins .
It is a joy to play . ''
