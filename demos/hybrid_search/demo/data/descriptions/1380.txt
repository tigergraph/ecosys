Stone Roses ' lead singer Ian Brown has claimed that the song is about sin , how individuals want to be idolized , and how we would do anything to attain that goal .
-LRB- thanks , Rachel - London , England -RRB- The Stone Roses were one of the first so called `` Madchester Shoe Gazing '' bands and were expected to be one of the biggest bands of the '90s .
Internal strife , drug use , and ego problems wrecked those chances , and they split in 1996 .
-LRB- thanks , John - Levittown , NY , for above 2 -RRB- This song is featured in the movie Welcome To Sarajevo .
In a 2009 interview with Clash Magazine , Brown explained that he `` did n't actually want people to adore me .
I was trying to say then , if you want to be adored , it 's like a sin , like lust or gluttony or something like that . ''
