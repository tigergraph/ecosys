Tim McGraw co-wrote and performed on this along with Def Leppard members Phil Collen , Joe Elliot and Rick Savage .
The Country singer put the wheels in motion in 2005 with the help of his longtime tour manager Robert Allen , brother of Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen .
The actual collaboration process began a year later when McGraw sat in on their Hollywood Bowl show .
McGraw recalled : `` We did n't start with any preconceived notions about the song .
Each of us brought something different to the table and we drew on each others influence to finish it out .
They are simply one of the best rock bands ever and it was a great time working together . ''
-LRB- quote from McGraw 's website -RRB- The song was debuted on the Guitar Hero III music video game .
Joe Elliott explained why to NME : `` Record companies are looking for angles these days because there 's no industry left .
Nobody 's going to play a new Def Leppard song on the radio because we do n't fit the format .
I ca n't see -LRB- BBC Radio 1 DJ -RRB- Chris Moyles playing anything much more than ` Animal , ' and -LRB- BBC Radio 2 DJ -RRB- Chris Evans is n't going to play our new single , so games were deemed the next best thing .
The Guitar Hero people said , ` We 'd love a new song ' , so they put it up and off it went . ''
