In our Songfacts interview , Springfield explains the meaning of this song : `` It says , ` I 'm so tired of all this s -- t that I feel . '
But nobody got it .
And there was a coke spoon hanging off of my dog 's neck in the second album , so we slipped a few things by .
I mean , I do n't throw swearing in other than when I think it really fits .
Maybe I 'm a little angrier as I get older , which is kind of weird .
I thought you were supposed to be more peaceful as you got a little older , but I find I have much less tolerance for the dickheads . ''

Thanks in part to the smash-hit single `` Jessie 's Girl , '' the album Working Class Dog was Springfield 's break-out success - despite being the fifth studio album he 'd released , after nearly a decade recording .
He did have four singles prior to this which charted , however : `` Speak to the Sky '' -LRB- # 14 -RRB- , `` What Would the Children Think '' -LRB- # 70 -RRB- , `` American Girls '' -LRB- # 98 -RRB- , and `` Take a Hand '' -LRB- # 41 -RRB- .
The album art depicts a Bull Terrier dressed in working-class attire and sitting at a desk .
That 's actually Springfield 's own pet dog , named Ronnie , who passed away in 1994 .
This photo garnered the album a 1981 Grammy nomination for `` Best Album Package . ''
Working Class Dog was re-released on CD in 2006 as a `` 25th anniversary edition '' with three bonus tracks .
