Solomon Burke told Mojo magazine August 2008 : `` I wrote that on the train , ` cos I had no song and I started thinking on old songs that I could do uptempo and I thought , -LRB- sings Gospel song pacier , with horn arrangement -RRB- so I had to keep that in my head 'til I got to the studio .
I said , ` Can I have a tuba like I have in my church ? '
In my church we got the tuba and the trombones .
Got to get that New Orleans sound .
They loved it . ''
This was covered by Otis Redding on his 1965 album Otis Blue .
