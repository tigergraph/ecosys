Justin Moore penned this Outlaws Like Me track with Jamie Paulin -LRB- `` Grandpa '' , `` Backwoods '' -RRB- and Ashe Underwood , whose other credits include Craig Campbell 's `` Fish . ''
Moore discussed the tune in an interview with the radio station WSOC : '' ` Run Out of Honky Tonks ' is one of the most Country songs that I 've ever recorded .
I wanted to make it a point to make this album a little more country that the first one .
Everybody looks at me like I 've got two heads when I say that but it was really important to me to cut a really , really country album .
I think this is one of those songs that speaks to that .
It 's just a good old country heartbreak song . ''
