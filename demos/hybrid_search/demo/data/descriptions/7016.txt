This is the second single by R&B singer Rihanna , which is from her fifth studio album , Loud .
The song was written by Ester Dean whose previous credits include Usher 's `` Hot Toddy , '' Katy Perry 's `` Firework '' and Christina Aguilera 's `` Not Myself Tonight . ''
Dean also had a hit under own name with `` Drop it Low . ''
Rihanna said of Dean to Billboard magazine : `` She really captured me , everything I would say and how I would say it .
Some people get it halfway right .
She just gets it and knows exactly what you want to hear . ''
This was produced by the Norwegian production team Stargate , who also worked on the Loud tracks `` Only Girl -LRB- In The World -RRB- , '' and `` S&M . ''
The duo previously collaborated with Rihanna on her hits `` Do n't Stop The Music , '' `` Hate That I Love You '' and `` Rude Boy . ''
Drake and Rihanna had a short-lived fling a year or so before this was recorded .
The Canadian MC addressed their affair on his track `` Fireworks . ''
When this topped the UK singles chart in January 2011 , Rihanna became the first ever female solo artist in chart history to achieve # 1 singles in five consecutive years .
The only other solo artist to equal this achievement was a singer you might have heard of called Elvis Presley between 1957-63 .
Dean told Billboard magazine Rihanna 's biggest strength is that `` she does n't try to sound like you ; she sounds like herself .
She 's not in there trying to figure out how she can beat you singing your song .
She goes in there and says , ` I 'm going to sing this song because I f -- ing love it . ' ''
The Toronto rapper Drake is featured on this track , which finds the two artists trading come-ons .
Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate told Billboard magazine how Rihanna personally presented the track to the Canadian MC .
`` She played the record to Drake backstage somewhere to try to get him on a verse , '' he recalled .
`` She 's calling me up saying , ` Where are the files ? '
That 's one thing you do n't hear often from artists on her level . ''
`` Drake is the hottest rapper out right now , '' Rihanna added , `` and we 've always been trying to work together .
He 's the only person I thought could really understand the melody of the song , and the minute he heard it he said , ' I know exactly what I 'm going to do .
I love it . '
And he did it like three days later . ''
This was Rihanna 's eighth US # 1 and featured artist Drake 's first .
