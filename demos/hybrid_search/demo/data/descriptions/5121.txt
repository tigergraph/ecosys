This stuttering track finds Minaj taking shots at her rival Lil Kim -LRB- `` All these bitches my sons / I ` mma get 'em a nanny '' -RRB- , whilst paying tribute to Jay-Z .
Jay likes to call himself , ` Hova , ' a play on the word Jehovah as he considers himself the `` God '' of rap .
Minaj told NME : `` That 's got so many meanings .
It 's the ` HOV lane , ' which is the fast lane on the highway , and ` Hov ' is Jay-Z and it talks about him being a male mogul who 's done so much .
That 's what I wanted to do . ''
Minaj 's mention of `` Orlando All-Star '' is a reference to when she opened up the 61st annual NBA All-Star Game at Orlando 's Amway Center and performed a medley of four of her hits .
