Kyle Falconer -LRB- vocals/guitar -RRB- wrote this song just after his father died when he was about 16 .
Falconer explained to The View Are On Fire why strings were added to this track : `` We always had an idea to try and make it Fleetwood Mac-y and build it up .
We tried the strings on the synth , but they never worked .
So we had this guy Olly -LSB- Kraus -RSB- doing the strings for us in New York .
He had a bash and it sort of changed .
The mood was good , man .
We never had any intentions of using strings .
But this guy is a pure genius .
He just does everything , every instrument , one by one , on his own in his flat in New York . ''
