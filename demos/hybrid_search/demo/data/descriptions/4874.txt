This Chase & Status produced tune is the title track of British rapper/singer Example 's third album .
He told The Guardian there is an overall theme running through the record .
`` This is my drugs and commitment album , '' he said .
`` The music industry puts a lot of strain on your relationships and social life .
There 's always pressure or opportunity to take drugs and to drink and to stay up all night and to cheat .
This whole album is me asking : ` Should I be doing drugs ?
Should I be drinking ?
Should I commit ?
Should I stop partying ?
Should I settle down ? '
That 's what the title is , too -- Playing in the Shadows .
Am I trying to be someone else ?
Is it a split personality ?
But it 's also about being in clubs with drugs and women getting thrown at you .
I 'm worried that being comfortable and having a family will mean I ca n't write songs that touch people any more .
Then , if I do have a family , what will my kids think ?
What do I say to them when they hear me talking about cocaine like it 's a beautiful woman ? ''
