Lead singer Robert Smith is singing about regret , wishing he could go back and make things right , but it 's too late .
The specific person in the song is his friend Billy Mackenzie , singer of the Scottish New Wave band `` The Associates , '' who committed suicide in 1997 .
Smith explained : `` He was with us for the ` Mint Car ' video .
We were having a drink at a table and were supposed to meet the week after to have a drink together .
Then he left and Billy 's family announced to me that he 'd killed himself .
Of course I had different feelings , as anyone would have when a friend commits suicide , anger , culpability , and obviously sadness .
I 'm happy this single means something to me , ` cos most of the time , singles are just made for radio . ''
-LRB- thanks , Martin - Rostock , Germany -RRB- The title is a play on words .
`` The Cure '' is an anagram for `` Cut Here . ''
It also indicates that Robert Smith believed this could be The Cure 's last song .
