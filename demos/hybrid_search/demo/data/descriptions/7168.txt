Watkins penned this song with Johnson and the singer told Kerrang !
magazine : `` This started off as an idea that Luke had , I had the chorus and the melody , and we came up with this cool verse .
The only thing we could think to do was this urgent , not-quite-rapping delivery .
We toyed with the idea of getting someone else to do it , but then one day I just have it a go . ''
