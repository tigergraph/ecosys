Carrie wrote this song about reuniting with a loved one in heaven with Nashville songwriter Hillary Lindsey and former Evanescence member David Hodges .
The power ballad was originally intended for the Chronicles of Narnia : The Voyage of the Dawn Treader soundtrack .
However , `` There 's a Place For Us , '' which the same trio also wrote , was chosen instead .
Underwood performed an emotional version of this song at the 2013 CMT Music Awards in memory of those who lost their lives in the devastating tornado that swept through her home state of Oklahoma on May 20 , 2013 .
The song was released as the fourth single from Blown Away , on April 15 , 2013 .
Underwood gave the tune its live television debut on the April 4 , 2013 episode of American Idol .
Underwood said in a promotional video about the song that the lyrics are a spin on death .
`` It 's not the end , '' she explained .
`` In my mind , in my faith and what I believe , there is a heaven .
There is a God and we 're going to be there someday .
It 's of course very sad to lose somebody here on Earth , but having that faith and knowing that you 're going to see them again is such an amazing thing , such a comforting thing , such a happy thing .
That 's what the song is all about . ''
`` I do n't like too many sad songs on an album , '' she added , `` but this one takes a sad subject and puts a faith-filled positive spin on it . ''
