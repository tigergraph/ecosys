This was a track from British singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading 's self-titled third studio album .
She told Melody Maker the story behind the song : `` I was going home to Hayes one night , and there was this boy .
He was only young , 18 or whatever .
I was waiting for the train and he was doing circles around me .
When I get into the train , I was the only one in the compartment .
And up comes this little lad , takes off his hat , saying , ` Can I sit by you , please . '
I said , ` All right , then , ' and we chat .
Then I get off at my stop .
And he says , ' I get off here , too .
I work around the corner .
Can I walk you to your door ? '
Well , he does , and he obviously does n't want to go , so I ask him in for a cup of coffee .
I play a record and give him an apple or something , and I ask him to go off to work .
And that was it .
That 's all that happened .
But the song is about what I knew was in his mind .
His name was Donald . ''
