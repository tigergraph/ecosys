This ballad was Zutons saxophonist Abi Harding 's first vocal contribution .
Frontman Dave McCabe told the Norwich Evening News that this was about tension with his band mates .
He said : `` It 's about us doing one another 's head in .
We 're always getting on each other 's nerves , but then we 've always had tension .
After six years in each other 's company , it 's inevitable that you end up noticing the negatives much quicker than the positives . ''
