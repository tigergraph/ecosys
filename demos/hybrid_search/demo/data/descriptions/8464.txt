Karen O wrote this song for the soundtrack of Tim Burton 's 2012 animated remake of his movie , Frankenweenie .
The song is played over the film 's closing credits .
Speaking about the track , the Yeah Yeah Yeah 's frontwoman said : `` Tim wanted an unconventional unconditional-love song .
My music inspiration came out of the same era of B-movie fright film references sprinkled throughout the film .
`` She added : `` I went in the direction of exotica and calypso stylistically because it 's quirky , good vibes music of that era and when you throw in a theremin solo it 's a marriage made in heaven .
We ended up with a love song for the end of the film to the film ! ''
