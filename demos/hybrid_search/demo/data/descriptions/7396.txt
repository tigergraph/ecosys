Lead singer Jon Oliva explained in Holland edition Aardschok/Metal Hammer February 1990 : `` Three songs on Gutter Ballet : ` Mentally Yours ' , ` Summer 's Rain ' and ` Thorazine Shuffle ' together form a trilogy .
It is true that the story that runs through these three songs is fictive again , but this time it is based upon facts .
It 's a pity , but in America these things occur too often .
It 's a story about Timmy .
In ` Mentally Yours ' he 's still a little boy .
His father left and his mother and him drive each other completely insane because they ca n't live with each other .
Timmy has a difficult childhood and eventually he runs away from home with his girlfriend .
But he 's so twisted , that he often beats her up .
He torches the cat ... to sum it up he 's totally insane , sadistic and sick . ''
