Louisiana born Country music and Cajun singer-songwriter Hunter Hayes began his musical career at the age of four , making appearances at both local performances and on national television .
At the age of six he appeared in the movie The Apostle alongside Robert Duvall , who gave Hunter his first guitar .
In 2010 , whilst still a teenager he signed to Atlantic Records Nashville and co-wrote `` Play '' for Rascal Flatts ' Nothing Like This album .
This is his first single from his debut album , on which Hunter played every instrument and wrote or co-wrote every track .
Hunter told the story of the song in an interview with The Boot : `` I got to write with a couple of guys , one of which I 'd never written with before , by the name of Mike Busbee .
I was also writing with Gordie Sampson , who was one of the co-writers I write with , and he 's from Canada .
He comes in with this idea called ` Storm Warning . '
A lot of times we come up with ideas we can write around and try to figure out what we can relate to .
On this day , I do n't know why , I took ` Storm Warning , ' and went from weather to love in a heartbeat .
As a 19-year-old , I figured out that it made me feel like the girl I was interested in at the time was not bad news , but not necessarily good for me .
I wanted to spend time with her , I wanted to get to know her , but at the back of my mind I knew that it was probably going to end soon and it was n't going to end well .
There were red flags all over , but I just ignored them .
That 's what I related to , for whatever reason , and we ended up writing that exact thing . ''
