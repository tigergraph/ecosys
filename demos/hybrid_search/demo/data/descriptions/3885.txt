Soundgarden 's sixth album , King Animal , was the band 's first release since their 1996 set Down on the Upside .
This is its lead single , and it finds frontman Chris Cornell attempting to come to grips with the fact that he , along with the rest of the band , had been out of the public eye for too long .
`` I got nowhere to go and it seems I came back ! ''
he proclaims .
Speaking to San Francisco radio station Live 105 , Cornell recalled that the title phrase and basic idea for the song came to him one sleepless night , as he was lying awake listening to the radio .
The lyrics came much later when the album was almost finished , after another sleep deprived night and the song `` became more autobiographical . ''
`` I do n't think I would write lyrics to a Soundgarden album that would be like Eminem writing lyrics to a new Eminem song , which is essentially telling the story of the making of the album and where he feels he exists in pop culture and that kind of thing , '' he continued .
`` So it 's not really that , it 's more autobiographical and more of a look back at history in sort of a strange atmospheric way , the way that I write .
But the initial spark of the idea did feel like it would be right in the narrative of , yes , we 've been out , and we 've been gone for 15 years , and now we 're back .
It 's about time , and we still have something to say about rock music that no one else is saying and I feel confident about saying that . ''
