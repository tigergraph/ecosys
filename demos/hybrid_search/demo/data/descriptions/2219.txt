Mystery Jets frontman Blaine Harrison was born with spina bifida , a condition which has affected his leg muscles all his life .
The singer had many operations as a kid and he penned this song about one of his spells on a children 's ward .
Said Harrison to The Metro : `` It was about the time I was put on a leukaemia ward , not that I had leukaemia , but the little boy opposite me had lost his hair and kept it in a bag .
It happened when I was a child but I only wrote the song later .
A lot of things that happen to you in childhood reappear to you later in dreams as a grown-up , which is inspiring as a songwriter . ''
Harrison told The Metro that this was the first song that he ever wrote .
