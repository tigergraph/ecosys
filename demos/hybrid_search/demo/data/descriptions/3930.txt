Francesca Battistelli penned this tune with Seth Mosely , who fronts the Christian rock band Me In Motion , and with Hillsong 's Mia Fieldes .
`` I love this song because it reminds me daily that God is the source of my peace , and even when things are chaotic all around me , He is in control , '' commented Battistelli .
`` Yielding our lives and our desire for control to Him brings a peace that makes our doubts and fear fade away . ''
