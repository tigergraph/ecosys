Natassia Gail Zolot is an American Hip-Hop singer-songwriter based in Oakland , California , who records under the name of Kreayshawn .
Her mother is Elka Zolot , former member of '90s all-girl surf punk band The Trashwomen .
Kreayshawn attended Berkeley Digital Film Institute , but never finished the program .
However she put her experience to good use directing videos for the likes of fellow Bay Area MC Lil B and Red Hot Chili Peppers -LRB- `` The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie '' -RRB- .
The song was produced by DJ Two Stacks and finds Kreayshawn proclaiming her disdain for wearing designer brands such as Gucci , Louis Vuitton , and Prada : `` Basic bitches wear that s -- t , so I do n't even bother , '' she raps .
Despite the less than complimentary nature of the track , Gucci did contact Kreayshawn .
`` Did they offer me free clothes ? ''
she told Q magazine .
`` Hell no !
I 'd just set them on fire . ''
The Californian rhymer is a free spirit when it comes to the clothes she wears .
`` I dress myself , I 'm anti-stylist , '' Kreayshawn explained to Boombox .
`` With the ` Gucci Gucci ' video , me and my sister , we went out to like a whole bunch of thrift stores , 'cause that 's all I had .
I never really had money to buy clothes so what I would do is just , like , go to thrift stores and buy shirts and cut 'em up and stuff like that . ''
This is her debut single and it was its release on June 14 , 2011 that really launched Kreayshawn 's career .
The video generated nearly three million views in its first three weeks and led to a $ 1 million recording contract with Columbia Records .
The video was directed by Joseph Zentil of Strange Customs and finds Kreayshawn rapping and ghostriding with her sidekick , DJ Lil ' Debbie .
Jasper Dolphin , Taco and Left Brain of the Hip-Hop group OFWGKTA also make appearances in the clip .
Kreayshawn created the concept for the video within hours of standing in front of the camera .
`` We thought of the video idea the day before the frickin ' video was shot , so , you know , '' she told The Boombox , `` It 's just all natural . ''
Kreayshawn explained to Billboard magazine regarding the album title : `` Somethin' ` Bout Kreay basically came from a situation where this guy was obsessed with me , kind of .
And my homie was like , ` Damn , there 's something about Kreay ' .
`` I was like , ` Oh my God , that 's perfect , ' cause people are very passionate about me whether they 're like ' I love Kreayshawn .
She 's the best , ' or it 's like ` Oh I hate Kreayshawn .
She 's the worst . '
So there 's always something about me that makes people feel a certain way . ''
