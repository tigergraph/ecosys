This song is about small-town gossip and the effect it has on the singer and the guy she 's secretly in love with .
It turns out that they 're rumored to be having an affair , and since the rumor-spreaders already think that the two people are involved , the song asks , why not have an affair anyway , thus giving them `` something to talk about . ''
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA -RRB- This won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance , beating out Oleta Adams , Mariah Carey , Amy Grant and Whitney Houston .
The song was also nominated for Record of the Year , but lost to `` Unforgettable . ''
For Raitt , this was by far her biggest chart hit in the United States .
This was written by the Canadian singer Shirley Eikhard , who had recorded in the Jazz and Country genres , but has had her most success as a songwriter , with songs recorded by Chet Atkins , Cher , Anne Murray and Rita Coolidge .
According to Anne Murray 's 2009 book All of Me , Anne wanted to record this song in 1986 , but her producers did n't think it would be a hit .
She called her 1986 album `` Something to Talk About '' even though it did not include this song .
Anne said she was happy that Bonnie Raitt made it a big hit five years later .
-LRB- thanks , David - Birmingham , AL -RRB- This is a very popular Karaoke song , and is often performed by American Idol contestants .
Season 3 winner Fantasia Barrino performed the song on the show , as did Idol notables Kellie Pickler and Sanjaya Malakar .
