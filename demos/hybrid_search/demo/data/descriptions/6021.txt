Vocalist Liam Cormier penned the lyrics for sound engineer Julian `` Bruce '' Bruso , who is a keen physics and science reader .
Cormier explained to Terrorizer magazine : `` Basically , when we tour , I do all of the night driving but I 'll get the dudes to come and sit up front and keep me company and we 'll talk s -- t. So , one thing for the last like two years , that Bruce and I have been doing is , I 'll drive and he 'll explain whatever physics book he 's reading , but he 's wasted and it 's like two or three in the morning when we 're driving .
So he 's trying to explain black holes and all of these concepts to me when he 's fu -- ing s -- t-hammered in the front .
It 's my favorite thing in the world , I love having our drunken physics lessons .
And there are nights where he 'd tell me all this s -- t and then the next morning I 'll try and tell it to him and he wo n't even remember .
It 's the best . ''
