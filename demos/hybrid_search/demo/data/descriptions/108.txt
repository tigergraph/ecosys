This satirical look at Eminem 's life is a track from Relapse Refill , a re-released version of Slim Shady 's Relapse album with seven bonus tracks .
Said Em : `` I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned .
Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year . ''
The controversial rapper raised more than a few eyebrows on one of the song 's lyrics in which he lobs homophobic slurs at three artists .
The trio in question , who are all openly gay , are former ` NSYNC member Lance Bass and American Idol contestants , Clay Aiken and Adam Lambert .
MTV News asked Lambert whether or not he felt Eminem crossed a line with the lyric .
The 2009 American Idol runner-up replied : `` Well , he used a word that 's not necessarily very nice , but I 'm sure he 's got some sort of justification for it .
And I 'm not going to take it personally .
It 's cool , Eminem .
If you get mentioned in an Eminem song , you 're doing something right .
And I 'm sure he was planning on creating some controversy , because he 's a smart guy . ''
