In an interview with popmatters.com , lead singer Matthew Caws said : `` The title of the record comes from the lyrics of ` Do It Again , ' a song about appreciating everything in your life , even life 's struggles .
It 's our more positive and less dramatic version of ` what does n't kill you makes you stronger . '
Because the way I see it , you 're going to have to pull off a lot of Band Aids in your life . ''
