In this song , the singer is heartbroken when a girl he loves dies in a car accident : `` Next thing I remember I was crawling out from the car and seeing you lying there holding your head , kissing you for the last time the taste of blood on my lips . ''
He realizes now how much he loved her but is thankful that she is at rest in Heaven .
