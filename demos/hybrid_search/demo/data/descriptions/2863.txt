This is the first single to be released from Signed and Sealed in Blood , the eighth studio album by Celtic punk band The Dropkick Murphys .
The band started playing this in June 2012 during their European tour .
The album title comes from the lyrics of this song .
The rose tattoo referred to in this song appears on Casey 's arm and is a memorial to his grandfather who raised him after his father had died .
`` He taught me most things that make me who I am today , '' Casey told NPR .
`` He was a big union guy in Boston .
It 's in a visible place for me and I look down and I see it a lot .
He was such an inspiring man that it inspires me .
Oftentimes , I just catch it out of the corner of my eye and it literally changes my mood when I think of him and what a strong individual he was . ''
The lyrics are inspired by bassist Ken Casey 's own tattoos .
`` Throughout life - trials , tribulations , dates , times , places , things that are important to you , family , people who have passed away - tattoos on my body document my life and what I 've been through , things that have been important to me , '' he told NPR 's Audie Cornish .
`` You know , they 're all a part of the story . ''
The song was re-recorded in May 2013 with Bruce Springsteen on guest vocals as a charity single to benefit the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing .
