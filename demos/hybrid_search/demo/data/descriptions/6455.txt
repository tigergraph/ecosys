This song could be about John Lennon .
It mentions how McCartney and Lennon bonded over their love of music , and touches on the sour feelings between them when The Beatles broke up .
Lennon made some nasty remarks about McCartney and called him out in songs like `` How Do You Sleep ? . ''
McCartney seems to be struggling with how he was not able to tell Lennon how badly this hurt .
-LRB- thanks , Kendra - Berkley , MA -RRB- Another possibility is that the song is about a falling out with McCartney 's long time publicist of 15 years Geoff Baker , who Paul fired sometime around 2005 .
It was rumored that Baker was writing a tell-all book about McCartney , and Paul felt betrayed .
It 's worth noting that Peter Brown , the Executive Director of NEMS Enterprises -LRB- The Beatles ' management company -RRB- , also wrote a tell-all about The Beatles and was banished from any contact with them .
Peter Brown was such a close friend that John Lennon mentioned him by name in the song `` The Ballad Of John And Yoko . ''
