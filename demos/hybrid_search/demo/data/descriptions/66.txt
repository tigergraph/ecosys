This Crunk-influenced number was produced by American R&B singer and producer Tank and features Snoop Dogg .
Rowland said on her record label 's website : `` Ghetto is about good girls who dig bad boys and it 's one of my favorites .
As soon as Tank played it , I knew and recorded it in an hour .
` Ghetto ' is just so laid back and that 's why I had to have Snoop .
He just gives it that something .
I like it when a song can make you feel good . ''
