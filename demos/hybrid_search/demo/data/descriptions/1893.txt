This is the opening track from the self-titled debut solo album by producer and TV on the Radio guitarist Dave Sitek , which he recorded under the name of Maximum Balloon .
Sitek discussed the record 's lyrical content : `` It 's a little bit easier to make sex songs outside of the magnitude of TV On the Radio .
I 'm glad I was able to get visceral sex energy on to this record .
If there was a way I could get barbecue on to a record too , I would .
A scented record !
Because food and sex ... well , there you go .
The immediacy of this record was liberating - there 's no shroud of secrecy behind the music .
I want people to hear it when they 're in their cars , at a cheque-cashing place , making out with their girlfriend , wherever .
Initially there was no intention for Maximum Balloon to be anything beyond my own selfish experiment so I was a little bit shocked that a major label wanted to put it out .
But it was a release to be able to do whatever I wanted and not have to worry . ''
This song features Theophilus London .
Sitek explained to The Guardian September 15 , 2010 : `` Theophilus is a rapper and musician from Brooklyn .
I got hired by his label to do some sessions with him and we hit it off really well .
I played him some Maximum Balloon stuff and he was like , ' I love that ! '
so I said , ` Well you can be on it ! '
He just threw down some verses .
His intuition is flawless -- the guy can jump on anything .
I do n't hear the Neptunes comparisons myself , but I definitely take them as a compliment . ''
