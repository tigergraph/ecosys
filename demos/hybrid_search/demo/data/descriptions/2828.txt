Among the things yelled at the beginning of the song is , `` Heavens to Murgatroid !
, '' which is the catchphrase from the cartoon Snagglepuss .
Anthony Kiedis has said he does not like playing this song live .
This song features more of a rap style , and over the years Kiedis ' style has changed from rapping to singing .
This can be seen in the difference between the way `` Give It Away '' was played when it was released in 1991 , and the way it was played throughout the 2000s .
