This song is about feeling as though you ca n't change anything and that you do n't have the tools to fix what 's wrong , hence the line , `` left with no arms in the power struggle . ''
The song also touches on how those in power tend to be the only decision makers and that they expect us to simply follow and not ask questions : `` kneeling , appeasing ... the power struggle . ''
