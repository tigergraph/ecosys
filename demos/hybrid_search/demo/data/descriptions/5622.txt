Chesney told Billboard magazine why this Michael Mobley , Wendell Mobley and Neil Thrasher written song hit home to him .
Said the singer : `` When I was a kid we were very lower-middle class .
We were n't poor , but we did n't have a lot of extra money to go places .
So when we went on vacation , we packed the car up and we drove to Myrtle Beach .
Or we drove to Daytona .
Or we went to the Redneck Riviera : Panama City , Gulf Shores or Destin .
And I still love that .
That song is for everybody that grew up like I did .
It 's a beach song , but it 's a Redneck Kenny song .
These people work for a living .
Like he says in the song , ` No more building transmissions , he 's going deep sea fishin ' . '
I love that line .
That 's my family , that 's my friends .
That 's my cousins .
That 's my audience . ''
