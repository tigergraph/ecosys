The `` Drowning Man '' is probably U2 bass player Adam Clayton .
While Bono , The Edge , and Larry Mullen were devout Christians , Clayton did not share their faith .
Steve Wickham played the violin .
He would later join The Waterboys .
Bono used a biblical reference in this song : '' ... like eagles you 'll run , you 'll run / you 'll run and not grow weary ... '' Isaiah 40:31 reads : '' ... they will soar on wings like eagles / they will run and not grow weary . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bill - Johnstown , PA -RRB- The title is not mentioned in the lyrics .
It was taken from a play Bono was writing .
U2 never performed this live .
