Morrissey 's Your Arsenal album is regarded by many fans and critics as Morrissey 's heaviest effort to date .
The record represented a change in direction for the singer with its glam rock influence , most likely because of the production of ex-Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson .
Tragically , Ronson died of liver cancer at the age of 46 , less than a year after the album 's release .
Lyrically conflicted and ambivalent , this song appears to find Morrissey turning against his homeland , whilst bathing in the adulation he was receiving at the time across the Atlantic .
`` We look to Los Angeles for the language we use , '' he sings .
`` London is dead . ''
The song was used in promotions for the Fox crime drama TV series Lie To Me .
This song was released as a single in the USA reaching # 13 on Billboard magazine 's Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart .
It was not a single release in the UK .
Morrissey performed a version of this song on Saturday Night Live after the release of Your Arsenal .
The song was re-issued in 2011 on limited edition 7 '' vinyl formats with two previously unreleased b-sides : `` Safe , Warm Lancashire Home '' and `` Treat Me Like A Human Being '' as part of the promotion for a compilation , The Very Best of Morrissey .
