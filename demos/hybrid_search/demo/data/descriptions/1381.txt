Cole tackles the topic of abortion on this song , which he penned several years before the release of Cole World : The Sideline Story .
Speaking to Billboard magazine he explained : `` A song with dealing with young pregnancy , when you 're around that age of either late teens or early 20s or whatever age you are , it explores all of that from both sides ... That 's one of my favorites , and I 've been holding on to that song for like four years , just waiting for this album to come out . ''
The song 's music video was shot on the cheap in 2008 , before Cole had a record deal .
The clip , which was directed by the duo Bergman and Bohichik , portrays a couple wrestling with an unplanned pregnancy .
It stars the North Carolina MC with the Atlanta , Georgia model Antoinette Lenae playing his girlfriend .
