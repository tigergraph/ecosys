You Me At Six are a British Rock band consisting of vocalist Josh Franceschi , guitarists Max Helyer and Chris Miller , bassist Matt Barnes and drummer Dan Flint .
This track is from their second album , Hold Me Down .
The album title comes from a line on this song : `` You hold me down by keeping me around . ''
Franceschi explained why they named the record `` Hold Me Down '' to Kerrang !
January 2 , 2009 : `` As individuals the title seems to sum up everything between Take Off Your Colours and making the new album .
I felt like there 'd been a lot of stuff that 'd come our way , which we 'd never made public : internal issues , problems with our band and making it work , be it things like lawyers , labels - stuff we 'd kept private .
I felt like a lot of restrictions had come our way .
I liked the idea , although Hold Me Down sounds like a negative title , it 's actually saying , You ca n't hold me down because I can still do this ! ''
The phrase `` playing the blame game '' refers to the strategy of apportioning blame to others when things go wrong , rather than trying to put them right .
It was first recorded in 1958 in the writings of the British critic Kenneth Tynan .
