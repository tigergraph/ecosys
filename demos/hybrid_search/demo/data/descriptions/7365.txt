I was like , ` Woah , here it is again ! '

The message of it is ... I did n't feel like I was selling my soul to the devil or anything but there was a time a few years ago when I was n't listening to my heart a lot and I was traveling a dark path and it resulted in a physical injury .
I fell off the stage and not following my heart led to me being physically injured , which was a very horrible experience and very psychologically traumatic .
I thought that might be the end of me . ''
