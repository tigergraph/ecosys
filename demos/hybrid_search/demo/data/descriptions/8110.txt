Frontman Tom Higgenson told clickmusic.com the story behind this song : `` Basically , there was a time where there were a few different girls who would call me up .
They 're all like , ' I love you , I miss you , I ca n't wait to see you ! '
And then when you do actually see that person a few days later , they 're like ` oh , did I call you the other night ?
I 'm sorry , I was so drunk . '
They act like they do n't know what they were doing , they do n't remember , and they 're like a cold fish and want nothing to do with you in real life . ''
