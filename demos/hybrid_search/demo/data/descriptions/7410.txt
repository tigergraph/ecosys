The Manchester based DJ and producer Ben Pearce is the co-founder with Chris Farnworth of the record label/DJ agency Purp & Soul .
This slinky , Deep House music tune was his debut single .
It was released on March 26 2013 by Universal Music Group , under exclusive license from Under the Shade Records .
The song samples the bluesy vocals from the Anthony Hamilton song `` Cornbread , Fish & Collard Greens . ''
Pearce told Beatport the tune was a long time in the making , and he spent months tweaking it .
`` It 's probably the longest I 've ever spent on a track because I usually work very quickly , '' he said .
`` I 'm glad I procrastinated because the end result has been worth it .
The arrangement was pretty much always the same .
I added the higher pad quite late on , and when I had the base of the track , my girlfriend suggested the vocal .
I threw it over and it just worked . ''
