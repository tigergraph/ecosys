Push and Shove is the first No Doubt album on which vocalist Gwen Stefani and bassist Tony Kanal collaborated on the songwriting -LRB- they had previously only worked together on the singer 's solo albums -RRB- .
Stefani told The Sun : `` It was the first time we both wrote lyrics and melodies .
Tony was a lifesaver as I was so exhausted .
He 'd gone to classes and learned how to play the piano and how to use Pro Tools and wrote a lot of songs .
He inspired me and helped me because I did n't have the luxury of time .
In the past I 'd never write a song before the sun went down .
This time I had to be home for when Kingston got out of school . ''
This dance pop number , which explores issues of mistrust in a long-term relationship , was the first fruit of their labors .
Kanal told The Sun : `` We worked in the studio at my house .
We had to black out all the windows and this beautiful view of Los Angeles so Gwen could pretend it was night .
But it worked .
Once we wrote the song ` Undercover ' this massive weight lifted off our shoulders and we knew we could do it . ''
