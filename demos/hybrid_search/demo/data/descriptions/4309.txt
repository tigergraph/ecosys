Guitarist C.J. Pierce told Ultimate Guitar that this song , together with `` Shame '' was recorded acoustic , at a studio in a buddy 's house .
He added that for this song , `` we went back and did a little touch up on it from the original recording .
I kind of went back and did a little bit more stuff , and then I think Ryan -LRB- McCombs -RRB- re-sang it . ''
