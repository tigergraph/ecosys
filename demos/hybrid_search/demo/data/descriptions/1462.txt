Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry wrote this song and also sang lead - his first lead vocal on an Aerosmith recording .
Perry says the song is about `` heroin , cocaine and me . ''
With money coming in thanks to the band 's newfound success , Perry could afford luxuries like designer suits , and could also take as many drugs as he could handle , which was quite dangerous .
The band was still going strong despite their addictions , but Perry 's mother could n't stand the sight of her emaciated son and moved to Arizona .
