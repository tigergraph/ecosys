Shelby Lynne explained the origin of `` Loser Dreamer '' to SheWired : '' ` Loser Dreamer ' is about pretty much everybody I know .
It came from my best friend Brian -LRB- Harrison -RRB- , who engineered the record , and he was talking about a breakup a few years ago with a girl .
He was saying , ` She just never could understand why I could n't change , and she just called me a loser dreamer . '
That kind of kicked off my writing again when I started working on the record because I was in a little slump for a while . ''
