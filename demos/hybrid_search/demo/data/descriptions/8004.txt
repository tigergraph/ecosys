The Horrible Crowes are a side project formed by Gaslight Anthem frontman Brian Fallon with his guitar Tech , Ian Perkins .
Fallon explained on his blog , `` The name comes from a poem called the Twa Corbies , which means , ` two crows . '
Check it out , it 's a dark commentary on life . ''
This was the first single released by the band and it was made available for streaming through RollingStone.com on July 13 , 2011 .
The gloomy video tells the story of a man who 's seemingly lost everything he loved .
Corin Hardy , who 'd previously shot visuals for Biffy Clyro and Keane , directed the clip .
`` This song tells a pretty sad story , '' Fallon told Spinner .
`` I did n't feel right about alternative , meaning making a film rather than a music video is Corin Hardy .
He 's just amazing and he captured what the song feels like in this .
We present to you a film of a man becoming lost . ''
This is one of the more uplifting tracks from the 12-song album which finds Fallon singing about the complexities of relationships .
He told Billboard magazine why he used a different vehicle for these more personal songs to the ones he pens for The Gaslight Anthem : `` The record is about three relationships that I had - one when I was 18 , one when I was 19 or 20 , and my current one now .
-LSB- They -RSB- ended up causing me a lot of grief and a lot of sorrow from the process of living through -LSB- them -RSB- but it felt like big rock songs were n't the right way to do it .
I think that this record taught me how to write more personally and not necessarily use stories .
It was just me trying to work out my own stuff from my head . ''
