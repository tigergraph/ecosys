Tricky told The Sun July 4 , 2008 about the Jamaican singer on this track and `` Baligaga '' : `` Rod is a friend of mine from New York .
He used to do stuff just for fun , so the first time he ever recorded was with me .
I moved to LA and he used to hang out with me and we did vocals , mucking around .
Now he writes lyrics and records music . ''
` Bacative ' is Jamaican slang .
According to Tricky , `` if someone has your back , you 've got ` bacative ' . ''
Tricky said on his record label 's website that the female voice on this song , `` is this Spanish girl who I do n't really know and who is n't really a singer . ''
