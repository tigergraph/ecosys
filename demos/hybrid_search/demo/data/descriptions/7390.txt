In Barry Toberman 's biography of Sir Elton , this John/Taupin composition is said to have been inspired by Bernie Taupin 's failure to come to grips with city life when he first joined Elton in London .
The whistle referred to belongs to the train back to rural Lincolnshire .
Bernie Taupin was born on a farm near the town of Sleaford , the second of 3 brothers and the son a farm worker .
When he was young he moved to a village with the charming name of Owmby by Spital , and also worked on a farm .
If he had n't teamed up with Elton he 'd probably have ended up managing a chicken farm !
