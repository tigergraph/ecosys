This was written by Emmylou Harris together with the Canadian Folk music duo Kate and Anna McGarrigle .
Kate is the mother of Rufus and Martha Wainwright .
The threesome also wrote `` Sailing Round The Room '' together on the same album .
The McGarrigle sisters are friends of Emmylou .
She told The Sun June 6 , 2008 : `` I just love them .
I was a fan of their music first .
I first brought them down to sing on Bluebird -LRB- 1989 -RRB- and our friendship started there .
When it was time to write more songs , I thought well , I 'll just go up to Montreal .
If nothing else , we 'll have some nice conversation and sugar pie .
They always buy me sugar pie . ''
This was inspired by a TV program about Country music pioneers The Carter Family .
It tells the story of how Sara Carter fell in love with another man when she was already married to A.P. Carter .
However she was kept apart from him and her letters to him were intercepted .
Harris picked up the story in her interview with The Sun : `` Then one night , the family were on the radio in Texas , broadcasting all over the country .
And Sara did a dedication to her lover by name , ` I 'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes . '
The man got in his car and drove all night .
They were united and never left each other .
They were married until his death but she continued to work in The Carter Family . ''
