Katie Melua -LRB- From ilikemusic.com -RRB- : '' ` If You Were A Sailboat ' was written by my collaborator and producer , Mike Batt .
What I liked about the song is the fact that a lot of love songs tend to deal with the fluffy nice side of love , but this one deals with how you get very selfish when you fall in love with someone , and you do n't want to share them with the world you just want them all about yourself .
What 's genius about Mike 's lyrics is that instead of saying that directly he uses these crazy strange metaphors , ` if you were a piece of wood I 'd nail you to the floor ' and quite bizarre stuff and I like that .
Musically it sounds like a really nice smooth love song , but the message is pretty intense and quite dark . ''
