This is the title track from Lynyrd Skynyrd 's twelfth studio album .
The song title is a reference to a speech that President Obama gave in San Francisco where he referred to Americans who `` cling to guns or religion . ''
Vocalist Johnny Van Zant admitted to Billboard magazine that this track is likely to strike people as politically incorrect , but self-censorship has never been in Lynyrd Skynyrd 's vocabulary .
He said : `` We were just in Europe and -LSB- with -RSB- everybody that was the first question : ` What is the meaning of this ` God & Guns ? '
We believe in God and I think that Rickey -LSB- Medlocke , guitarist -RSB- says it best : ` Any religion that you believe in you should be able to pray to it . '
For me , personally , it is Jesus Christ and the Lord above .
`` Van Zant added that he does n't own any handguns , but supports the rights of others to do so .
`` It is a scary world out there and believe me that if someone were to try to come into my house , I want to be able to protect myself , '' he said .
`` We are not saying that every idiot out there should own a gun-and there should be better background checks on guns .
Not everybody should have the right . ''
God & Guns debuted at # 18 on Billboard 200 , Lynyrd Skynyrd highest-charting studio effort since Street Survivors reached # 5 in 1977 .
