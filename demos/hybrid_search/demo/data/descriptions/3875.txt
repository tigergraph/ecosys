Sanctus Real lead guitarist Chris Rohman told NewReleaseTuesday the story behind this song : `` Our lead singer , Matt Hammitt , had most of the song written .
It was written after Matt and his wife had a pretty gut-wrenching conversation , where she told him that she needed him to be a better spiritual leader to her and their family .
It rocked Matt 's world .
They 're the ones that have been married the longest in the band .
They 've been married longer than I have .
They already have two daughters and they 're expecting their third child right now .
Matt said that he found it humbling that his wife would have the courage to say something like that out of love .
Secondly , he realized that he had to do something about it .
There was no way around it .
We do n't believe in divorce .
There were some things they had to work on to keep that open dialogue between the two of them , so that they could admit problems and work through them .
That 's where the song came from .
The idea is actually at least a year and a half old .
We had a rough idea of the song because he had a demo , but it got put in the pile .
The president of our record label somehow found the song before we completely finished the record and said , ` Something is going on with that song .
I think it could really be turned into something special if you guys finish it . '
Until he said that , we had n't even entertained the thought of putting the song on the record .
When we went in the studio to finish the song with this writer from Nashville , the story came together perfectly .
The song is kind of a father 's prayer for his family and wife .
It 's an honest cry out to God saying , ` If I 'm going to lead my family , I need You to lead me . '
I can say this because I did n't have a lot to do with it .

I hope that hearing the story behind the song , and what went into writing it , will touch a lot of lives .
It 's a powerful song ! ''
