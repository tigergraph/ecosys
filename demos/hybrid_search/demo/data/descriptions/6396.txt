The title track of singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco 's seventeenth album is a revised version of a 1931 Florence Reece song , which was later popularized by Pete Seeger .
DiFranco transforms it from a labor protest tune to a leftist anthem over marital drums .
`` They stole a few elections/Still we the people won/We voted out corruption and/Big corporations , '' she sings .
`` We voted for an end to war/New direction/We ai n't gon na stop now/Until our job is done . ''
Joining DiFranco and Seeger on the song are a Hudson Valley-based children 's chorus , The Rivertown Kids , and a brass band consisting of students from The Roots of Music called The Roots of Music Marching Crusaders .
At the age of 92 , Seeger pops up on the track providing accompanying vocals and banjo .
DiFranco was inspired to record her version of this protest anthem after being invited to perform at Seeger 's 90th birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden in May 2009 .
She contributed her own verses to the song and has used it to close her own live shows ever since .
