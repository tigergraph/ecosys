This track from British rapper Speech Debelle 's second album Freedom Of Speech finds her capturing the mood of insurrection raging through the 2011English riots and translating her response into a state of the nation address : `` Go tell the judge and the jury/They do n't know half the story , '' she raps .
`` I feel it could give insight into the hearts and minds of some of the people that have taken part in , not only the peaceful marches for Mark Duggan in Tottenham and the Smiley Culture march for justice , '' she explained regarding the lyrical content .
`` But also I believe it speaks of the frustration of many young people who took part in the rioting and the consequent looting over London and areas of the UK .
I am not attempting to condone , I 'm attempting to be a voice of understanding . ''
Speaking to Victoria Derbyshire on her BBC Radio 5 program , Speech said this was the first song written for the album .
Though she penned it before the riots when they happened she immediately leaked the track .
The song features a guest spot from Speech 's label mate Roots Manuva .
