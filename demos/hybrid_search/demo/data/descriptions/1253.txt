This song deals with drugs and suicide .
Lines like , `` We 'll fly home '' and `` I think I 'll blow my brains against the ceiling '' indicate the singer is getting high and having suicidal thoughts .
MCR wrote this song for the people out there that are so down and depressed that they feel they need to kill themselves - they wrote it to try and make these people happier , hence the upbeat tempo of the song .
-LRB- thanks , Rhiannon - Manchester , England -RRB- This song started out as a joke , but lead singer Gerard Way saw potential in the song and encouraged the band to develop it .
-LRB- thanks , Jazmin - Gilbert , AZ -RRB- The line , `` Now these red ones make me fly and the blue ones help me fall '' resembles a scene in the movie The Matrix where Neo decides his fate by choosing either a red or blue pill .
-LRB- thanks , Laura - Toronto , Canada -RRB-
