This is a track from the New York Pop-Rock quintet The Morning Of 's second album , The Way I Fell In .
This song was inspired by the 2004 romantic fantasy movie , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .
Co-vocalist Jessica Leplon explained to Artist Direct : `` Justin -LRB- Wiley co-vocalist -RRB- had never seen the movie initially and we already had lyrics to ` Tell Me I 'm Wrong ' but they were n't really hitting for us .
It was n't sitting well with us , but we watched Eternal Sunshine when we were out in California recording and we wrote the lyrics .
I 'm glad how it turned out . ''
Leplon told Artist Direct that she gets song ideas when driving .
She explained : `` I like writing lyrics in the car .
When I think of something , I 'll put it in my own phone .
I open the memo pad and type ideas down .
It 's weird -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
When I get home , I 'll write the idea down in case something happens to the phone .
Usually , I always write in a car .
Your mind spins good ideas while you 're driving and all of these words pop up . ''
