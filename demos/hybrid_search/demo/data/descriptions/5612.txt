Frontman Jimi Goodwin told The Quietus that this funk based number almost did n't make it onto the Kingdom of Rust album .
He added : `` I was really pushing for it to be on there .
Some people were asking ` Does it stick out too much ?
Is it too sticky-outy ? '
But we managed to find a place for it and I 'm glad we did . ''
Jez Williams -LRB- guitarist -RRB- told the NME April 11 , 2009 : `` The groove on this had been knocking around for a bit , then we morphed into more of a Doves sound .
I wanted the bass to sound like The Clash , really raw and dark . ''
