This Mario Winans produced ballad is the second single from R&B singer-songwriter Trey Songz 's fourth studio album , Passion , Pain & Pleasure .
The song finds Songz longing for a lost love .
Songz told MTV News this song about platonic friends crossing the line shows his more mature side .
He explained : `` There comes a point in an artist 's career where , after you 've reached a certain level of success , people are looking for you to bring them the real , bring them something to just connect with .
` Ca n't Be Friends ' is a record that I feel everyone can relate to at some point or another ... it 's going back to classic Trey . ''
The song details a situation that Songz had , though he slightly embellished the narrative for the song .
He told The Boombox : '' ` Ca n't Be Friends ' is an experience that I 've been through , not per se to every specification of the lyric , but I find a way to make it appeal . ''
The song samples Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto 's `` Bibo no Aozora '' from the 2006 international film Babel .
The song was the follow up to Songz 's hit single `` Bottoms Up . ''
He told MTV News the selection was deliberate : '' ` Bottoms Up , ' of course , was the obvious record to catch your attention ; obvious smash club record .
But with a record like ` Ca n't Be Friends , ' it 's a record where I 'm trying to , you know , touch your heart , '' he said .
`` I want your emotions to be evoked as you listen to this record . ''
