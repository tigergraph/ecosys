Rancid said of this song on their MySpace site : `` The spirit of punk rock involves taking risks .
It 's about questioning authority and not subscribing to society 's norms and not falling into the rut and becoming a sheep .
Without risks you 'll never discover your potential .
This song is a prophecy , a mature assessment , or a realization .
In the vain of Culture and Peter Tosh . ''
