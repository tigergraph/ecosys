Co-frontman Scott McMicken explained this track to Express Night Out : `` It really does kind of kick into high gear .
I knew in that whole song there 's a certain level of desperation there 's a furious deal behind it , so when it got to that end it just felt dark , lost : ` Someone gave you bad directions / Were you in the wrong place at the wrong time ' and the whole thing about finding a body in the river and stuff .
It felt suddenly like a scary movie ; so I wanted things to truck up into this chase feel , like a bullet train or something . ''
