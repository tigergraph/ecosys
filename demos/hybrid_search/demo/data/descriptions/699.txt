Lead singer Sonny Sandoval : `` The lyrics got changed when the Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. came in .
The song took a whole new meaning when -LRB- Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. member -RRB- Gotti started singing the chorus .
He got really emotional .
That guy got shot 10 times in the back years ago and almost died .
So , he changed all the words from ` We ' to ` I ' because he was relating the chorus to himself . ''
-LRB- thanks , Tim - PGH , PA -RRB-
