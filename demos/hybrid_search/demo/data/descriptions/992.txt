Lynne explained the song to The Boot : `` I 've gone the road and I love the road , but it is really hard .
I 'm one of those people who have a hard time getting out of the house even though I 'm an old road dog , and I do love to get out there and sing .
I have to leave my dogs and my garden .
I 've just turned into such a homebody .
You do what you have to do , and I love traveling and being on tour out there with the guys and playing .
It 's hard for me .
I 'll sit here going , ` Oh my god , I 've got five more days at home before I leave for 40 days . '
I 'm freaking out . ''
