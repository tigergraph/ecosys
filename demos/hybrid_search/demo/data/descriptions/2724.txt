Currington explained to AOL why he recorded this song , which was written by Ashley Gorley , Bryan Simpson and Wade Kirby .
Said Currington : `` When I heard ` Walk On ' , it took me to the city of Manhattan .
For some reason , that 's all I could picture when I heard the song .
It just had that really cool vibe to it , and I felt like the song lyrically was one of the best songs that I had to pick from out of the thousands and thousands that I listened to .
I still feel that it 's one of the best-written songs on this album .
I just thought , whoever wrote this song wrote a really great song .
The melody had no holes in it , and it 's very simple -- what I call a pretty unique song .
I felt I could lend my voice to it , and make it really soar . ''
