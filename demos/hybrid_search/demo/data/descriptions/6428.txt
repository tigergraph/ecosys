This is the lead single and opening track from British singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson 's fifth studio album , Bella .
It is one of a number of songs on the record that finds Thompson baring his soul over the breakdown of a relationship .
He told The Sun that writing about the heartbreak came easily : `` You just have to turn on the tap and let it all out .
It 's very honest , which is the key thing in music .
Writing in the third person is less gouging on yourself but less powerful .
Less immediate . ''
