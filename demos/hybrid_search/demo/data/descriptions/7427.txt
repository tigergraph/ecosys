Bassist Tom Fleming -LRB- from Drowned in Sound -RRB- : '' Supposed to be a miniature epic , a Springsteen song on Coltrane chords .
There were two pianos , a good one and a bad one .
We of course chose the bad one , you can hear it grunting and fussing throughout . ''
Fleming explained to Drowned in Sound how the song evolved : `` It was first a song about fear - ` do n't open that door ' , but flipping that into something positive opened up the whole song and led it to be what it is .
Cixous - ` If you forget to love me for even an instant , my life would be instantly obliterated like a dream . '
I 'm not claiming we 've given it that heaviness , but we 're aware that exists . ''
