This is the debut single released by the Birmingham , England Indie-Rock band Swim Deep .
`` I wan na be everything that I 'm not , '' declares frontman Austin Williams .
`` I wan na be rich .
I want to show off . ''
The song title refers to a city in Monterey County , California .
Williams explained to Brum Notes Magazine : `` When we started out , we used to look on Wikipedia for places in California and name our songs after them -- Orange County , Santa Maria , Isla Vista .
When I wrote it , I just wanted to get out , to live a bit more and experience happier things . ''
This Indie-Rockstar fantasy is a paean to Jenny Lee Lindberg , who is the bassist of Los Angeles-based female quartet Warpaint .
Williams told Brum Notes Magazine : `` The whole Jenny Lee Lindberg reference is n't personal , it 's just a nod to that kind of teenage fantasy .
I 'm not at all anti-romance -- I love romance and anything to do with happiness . ''
Warpaint 's PR responded : `` She feels very happy that they want her so much to be their girlfriend .
Good luck chaps , swim onwards and upwards ! ''
