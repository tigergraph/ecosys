This collaboration with Alter Bridge singer Myles Kennedy , with whom Slash had already collaborated with on `` Starlight , '' was a late addition to the guitar legend 's self-titled debut album .
Slash explained to Musicradar.com : `` When we were thinking about getting a single I was thinking of writing another song and getting Myles to sing it .
Then it dawned on me that I had another killer piece or music that I had demoed up for this record but could n't think of anybody to sing it so I 'd been resigned to the idea of not doing it .
So I put an arrangement together and sent it to him and he wrote this killer part for it .
We flew him out to LA , recorded the song and squeezed it onto the record at the very last minute .
Before we even recorded the song we had to get the album artwork done and had to put the name of the song in there before it was recorded .
I knew it was going to be a good song , but it was by the seat of our pants .
It 's different to anything else on the record .
It 's a heavy , slow AC/DC kind of deal with really , really great vocals . ''
Kennedy is the only vocalist to be featured on more than one song on the album 's standard track listing .
