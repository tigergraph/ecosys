Vocalist Doug Robb told Artist Direct the story behind this song : `` The guy 's named Zach .
He 's a great friend of Dan Estrin 's , since infancy .
He 's basically his cousin .
He starts the story , and I think , ` God , that has happened to me so many f -- ing times . '
He 's going out with this girl .
The girl breaks up with him .
He hangs out with her because she still wants to hang out .
Watching him go through that was brutal .
I just wanted to grab him and go , ` F -- , dude !
Leave ! '
When you 're going through it , you 're stuck waiting in limbo .
That 's lyrically where the song came from . ''
