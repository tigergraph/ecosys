This song is about Knowle West , the area of Bristol in southwest England , where Tricky grew up .
He told Mojo magazine February 2008 : `` My great-grandmother went to the same school that I did-Connaught School .
There 's one song called `` Council Estate '' , which is about Knowle West .
It 's talked about as a violent area , but I do n't know if that 's fair , really .
I 'd say it comes down to education-if you 're not educated to express yourself with words , you end up doing it with fists . ''
This song is about Tricky 's upbringing .
He told The Sun July 4 , 2008 : `` It has one of the first lyrics I wrote for the album .
That song is like the stuff I live and I wanted to get it down on a record .
The Specials influenced it . ''
This is the first single that Tricky 's ever done with just himself on vocals .
He explained on his record label 's website : `` I could n't whisper that song .
I had to come out of myself and do a loud , screaming vocal .
I wanted to be a proper frontman on that one . ''
Many of the songs on the Knowle West Boy album also take their inspiration from the Bristol area where Tricky grew up , despite it being largely recorded on America 's West Coast .
Tricky explained to Mojo magazine : '' It 's about remembering where I come from .
It feels like my first album , really - it 's almost like the others do n't exist . ''
Tricky explained to The Sun why he decided to revisit his childhood on this song and others on the album : `` At school , there was a teacher who was really cool .
He said : ` When you go for a job and reveal your Knowle West postcode , nine times out of ten you 're not going to get it . '
We were n't supposed to get anywhere , so I 'm kinda proud .
Four or five generations of my family lived there .
My great-grandad was a horse dealer who took horses from Ireland to Bristol .
He and my Uncle Arthur were bare-knuckle fighters and my Uncle Martin was a boxer . ''
