Arctic Monkeys singer and principal songwriter Alex Turner spent much of the time during the writing and recording of Suck It and See in New York , so it is of little surprise he was inspired by some of the American music he 'd previously not been so familiar with .
He told NME how this reminiscence of an old relationship was influenced by the sounds of Nashville : `` I 've never listened to country music before , it was just something I totally did n't get until pretty recently .
I 've always been , ` Nah , not into that world ' , but I 've started to get something out of that now .
The sort of sounds of that music I 'm still not crazy about but the words are really good .
Like Hank Williams , George Jones and Roger Miller and even like Johnny Cash -- they 're just smart-arses , those guys , who write good country tunes , y' know .
It 's really funny or really sad .
And they do that thing so well .
This tune is the closest to that .
Not like in the sound , but in the lyrics . ''
Q magazine asked Turner if the song is about his girlfriend TV presenter and model Alexa Chung ?
He replied : `` I hope not , cos in the song it 's over . ''
