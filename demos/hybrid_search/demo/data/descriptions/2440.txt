Sleigh Bells are a Brooklyn noise-pop duo comprising guitarist and producer Derek E. Miller and vocalist Alexis Krauss .
This was released as the first promotional single from their second album Reign Of Terror .
The song was made available for streaming online on December 15 , 2011 .
Miller was asked by Digital Spy the reasoning behind the album title .
He replied : `` I went through some really difficult stuff with my family - nothing that I 'm really interested in getting into .
It came out of a really , really , really hard time , a really difficult time in my life .
It 's probably a little more literal than people think .
It 's not just something that we thought sounded cool .
It felt that like that was actually occurring on a personal level .
I 'm not going to call it my own Reign of Terror , but ... '' Krauss is chillingly dismissive of the subject of this track who has a death wish .
-LRB- `` Heard you say suicide in your sleep/Just get on with it/You were born to lose '' -RRB- .
The song is one of several cuts on the album that feature dark lyrical content .
However , when pressed by NME as to what lies behind them , Miller remained tight-lipped .
`` There 's a theme , '' he said .
`` It 's responding to events in my life .
With -LRB- first album -RRB- Treats ... I was in shock and denial when making it .
I 'm not interested in getting into the details of what was going on , but I listen to it now and again and I 'm like .
` The person who made this was avoiding something . '
That worked for the record , but I could n't avoid it anymore.I do n't like talking about my emotions ; that 's my way of dealing with it , because I 'm frustrated and unable to communicate .
That 's why I write songs . ''
