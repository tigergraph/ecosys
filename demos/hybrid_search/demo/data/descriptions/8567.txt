This is one of three new songs on R.E.M. 's compilation album , Part Lies , Part Heart , Part Truth , Part Garbage 1982 -- 2011 , which was released after the band announced they were disbanding .
Bassist Mike Mills told Billboard magazine that whilst the other tracks were written with the break up in mind , he was n't sure if this one was , `` but it applies in a really cool way .
First of all , lyrically , like , ` hey we do n't work at the same job any more . ' ''
Mills told Billboard magazine that the three new songs on the album show the three sides of R.E.M. over the years with this one demonstrating the `` playful goofy side . ''
Said Mills , `` Then there 's the harder-edged 6/4 time ` Hallelujah ' that we write .
And then there 's the soft , wistful midtempo ballad that we do .
It 's three facets of R.E.M. in 2011 that are extremely well represented . ''
The title is a play on the Southern expression `` A month of Sundays , '' which means a very long time .
R.E.M. 's hit `` Losing My Religion '' is also titled after a Southern phrase .
