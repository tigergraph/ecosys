This metaphorical account of the end of a relationship was released as the sixth single from Bastille 's debut studio-album , Bad Blood .
It was released as a digital download single on September 2 , 2013 .
The accompanying music video was shot in Lithuania and sees frontman Dan Smith traversing through a dream full of symbolism .
The surreal clip reflects the frontman 's love of David Lynch 's style and themes , which was also alluded to on the band 's `` Laura Palmer '' single .
Smith explained to DIY : `` For me , it really touches upon all of the Lynchian things that I always bang on about .
It 's a kind of dream narrative that gives the impression of a story , rather than actually telling one .
I 'm just really happy with some of the shots in it , and it 'll be interesting to see what people think . ''
`` There 's no fire in it , as well , '' he added .
Our big aim with the video was to make sure there would be possession that had been misplaced , and no fire .
It 'll be interesting to see what people think . ''
