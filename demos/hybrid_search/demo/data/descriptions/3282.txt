This features Fergie .
It was originally intended to be a track on the Black Eye Peas vocalist 's next solo album , but after the song 's producer Polow Da Don played it to Nelly he snapped it up .
Fergie explained to MTV News what happened : '' ` Party People ' started as a song that Polow Da Don and I did back when I did ` London Bridge ' and ` Glamorous . '
Basically , it was almost done .
Trina did a verse on it ; that 's why you hear me say her name on the song .
Everyone thought it was too street for me at the time .
-LSB- Laughs . -RSB-
So that 's why they did n't want to put it on The Dutchess .
It was left off , and I was gon na put it on my next album .
Polow played it in the studio for Nelly , and he flipped out and turned the song around and made it into a major club banger , brought his energy , and it just became this monster .
He played it for me .
I told Polow , ` You know I was saving this song for my next album .
But I ca n't hate on it , because it 's good !
I like it !
I like this version . '
And all the label heads loved this version .
And Nelly called me like , ` It 's crazy ! ' ''
Nelly immediately knew that this would be a single release .
He told MTV News : `` As soon as I heard it , I knew it was Nelly .
It had everything that I really wanted .
The beat is infectious .
The feel of it is right where it needs to be - right what I want to do as far as killing it over the summer .
It was perfect . ''
Nelly told MTV News that he and Polow had already recorded 10 songs for the album when the producer played him the music for `` Party People . ''
The St Louis rapper thought `` I 'll take it . ''
He added : `` I kind of reconstructed it a little bit , put some Nelly in it , rearranged it some more , and it came out to be the song you hear today . ''
