This piano ballad is the fourth single from American R&B singer-songwriter Jason Derulo 's self-titled debut album .
During a BBC interview , Derulo commented , `` It reminds me of a Beatles hook .
The whole song is just one big hook . ''
Ethan Lader directed the music video , which features everything going backwards .
Derulo explained the song 's lyrical content to the BBC : `` It 's abut meeting someone for the first time .
Cos you never know what effect that person 's gon na have when you first meet them .
So I 'm telling this girl y' know , what if in two years , three years from now we 'll be married with children and living in a log cabin ? ''
