This spoken-word piece is about Gauthier 's telephone conversation with her birth mother , who put her up for adoption when she was born on March 11 , 1962 .
Gauthier explained : `` I hired someone to help me find my birth mother .
She was located in three days , but it took me 6 months to muster up the courage to call her .
There were moments when I did not know if I had the courage to continue what I had started .
My fear had me frozen , too scared to go forward , unable to go backwards .
When I finally did call her it did not go well .
What I found when I located my mother was a woman who was filled with shame for having gotten pregnant without a husband in 1961 .
She was filled with remorse for having given her baby away and terrified of the stigma involved in what she 'd done .
She later married a man , adopted his two kids and was with him for 24 years before he passed away , but never told him or anyone else about me .
Almost fifty years later , I was still her shameful secret .
She had no desire to meet me .
It was too much for her . ''
In our 2010 interview with Mary Gauthier , she said that the conversation she describes in this song is the only contact she 's had with her birth mother .
Said Gauthier : `` That 's it .
Unless I choose to go knock on her door , which I might one day .
But I might not .
I do n't know .
I feel like I should respect her desires .
Although a part of me feels as though I should know where I came from .
I feel as though she should tell me who my father is , but she does n't want to .
So I just do n't know what to do with that , so every day that goes by , I know one day she 's not going to be with us anymore , but I just do n't know what to do .
So that one 's kind of dangling there in limbo .
But interestingly , telling the story has brought me closer to my adoptive mother . ''
