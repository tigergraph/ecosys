This is the first single from Heartland Highway , the eighth studio album by Florida Alternative Rock Band Sister Hazel .
The song was written by lead guitarist Ryan Newell and an artist named Aslyn with whom the band have toured with through the years .
Both musicians are from Atlanta .
Newell discussed the difficulties of choosing the lead single in a press release for Heartland Highway : `` No one thinks about singles until the record is done .
Some songs turn out better than others .
Some songs are a surprise .
Some songs go as expected .
You never really know .
For us it 's really hard to judge ourselves , '' he said .
`` We 're not really sure sometimes where the strength lies on our record .
So we definitely rely on outside opinions .
We play it for trusted friends and fans from the past and management is definitely involved .
As far as the band , if we had to pick it 100 percent ourselves I think we 'd still be trying to decide .
It 's kind of like giving yourself a haircut , you do n't really know what it looks like , you have to have someone else give you a third person opinion . ''
Newell told AntiMusic about the song : `` The band worked up all of the songs on our new record in our rehearsal space in Gainesville Florida .
All the parts and arrangements came together in those pre-production sessions .
All of the instruments were recorded at Vibe studios in Nashville .
The guitars used on that song were two telecasters going through a Matchless DC-30 and a Fender Deluxe .
The vocals were recorded in Gainesville with a portable pro tools rig in a hotel suite .
Then back to Nashville were the song was mixed by Chip Matthews and myself .
Stay Awhile has a simple , yet feel good vibe to it and it plays really well live . ''
