Written by Hank Cochran and Harlan Howard , this was arguably the first pure Country single to cross over to the Pop charts .
It established Patsy Cline 's sophisticated weepy style.Legendary songwriter Harlan Howard was the perfect talent to bring onboard for the writing of this song .
Bill DeMail quoted Howard 's explanation of his proclivity for complex love songs in his Performing Songwriter obituary .
`` The toughest songs in the world to write are love songs , '' he said . '' '
I love you and I will forever and blah blah blah . '
I 'd rather get into a song about a relationship that 's a little bit shaky or even tragic .
That in my mind represents country music and the drama of the man-woman thing . ''
Howard , who passed away in 2002 , wrote hit songs for performers as diverse as Ray Charles , Johnny Cash , and Patty Loveless .
According to Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs , `` Cline was reluctant to record this ballad , which had been turned down by Brenda Lee , until producer Owen Bradley coaxed her into it .
The sound was stone country but wrapped in elaborate Pop , with Cline crying inside , like a nerve rubbed raw by heartbreak . ''
