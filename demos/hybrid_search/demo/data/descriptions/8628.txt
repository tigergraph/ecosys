This is the first single from Canadian Christian rockers Thousand Foot Krutch 's sixth studio album , The End Is Where We Begin .
The song was made available to download on December 1 , 2011 .
TFK frontman/songwriter Trevor McNevan explained to NewReleaseTuesday that the songs he wrote for The End Is are more aggressive in nature and this track sums up the album 's heart .
`` This song embodies the heart and soul of this record both physically and spiritually , '' he said .
`` I think it captures that urgency - that there are wars going on all around us and inside us .
There 's something beautiful about ` the sound of change , ' and I think this song covers those ideals and the essence of battle .
Change can be beautiful and painstaking , but rarely is it comfortable . ''
