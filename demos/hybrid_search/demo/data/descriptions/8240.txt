This riffy working man 's anthem originally was written as a heavy rock number .
Kid Rock told Billboard magazine how producer Rick Rubin persuaded him to transform it into more of a organic R&B based rock and roll song to go along with the rest of Born Free .
Said Rock : `` That started out as a really heavy rock and roll thing , and then when we got in there with Rick he said ` let 's channel some of that Muscle Shoals type of thing , keep it true with what we 've going on the record . '
He was really cool about the continuity of the record , without telling people what to play at all He 's really good at setting up the vibe .
Even in the studio , if he said ` wow , that might be the worst thing I 've ever heard , ' he 'd laugh about it .
There was never any screaming or yelling , it was always ` let 's do it a different way . '
Then when we 'd hit one , he 'd say , ` that was no joke , see you guys tomorrow . ' ''
