This is the lead single and title track from Welsh singer/songwriter Charlotte Church 's sixth studio album .
The song was originally written about a relative but after Church 's relationship with rugby international Gavin Henson crumbled , she described the song as being more relevant to her own break-up .
Said the singer : `` It became the perfect song for my situation , so I sing it with a lot of conviction . ''
