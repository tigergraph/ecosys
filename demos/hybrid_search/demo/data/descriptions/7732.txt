This was the debut single released by American Country music singer-songwriter Kip Moore .
The song peaked at # 45 on the Country chart .
Moore penned the song with frequent collaborator Dan Couch and Nashville singer-songwriter and guitarist Scott Stepakoff .
Moore told Mike Ragogna of The Huffington Post how the song recounts meeting up again with a girl that he used to know at school : `` Dan Couch and I were in the room with Scott Stepakoff one day , and we had been banging around on that rhythm , '' he recalled .
`` I had that opening riff the whole day , and we probably wrote five songs over that before it came out .
Throughout the day , I had mentioned that I went home and ran into a girl I have n't seen in six or seven years , who I went to high school with .
In High School , she was one of those girls that just slipped through the cracks .
You would see her go through the hall and you never really noticed her .
She always hid her head down and was mild-mannered and meek .
Then , fast forward six years later to a party I was at when I was back home , she was amazing .
Not only was she beautiful but she was smart , funny , charming , and witty .
She had grown into her figure and she became confident , and had a great job .
There was such a charisma about her , and I really wanted to kick myself in the ass for not noticing that at that age , along with all of my other friends .
I think that 's just part of growing up . ''
