Gloriana 's Tom Gossin wrote this song about his fianc√©e Jaime .
He explained to Billboard magazine : `` We dated for ten years , on and off .
One of our big splits happened when I went on the road with Gloriana for the first time .
We were living together in Wilmington , N.C. , and I got the call saying , ` You guys are going to open for Taylor Swift .
You start in a couple of days . '
I asked , ` When will we be back so I know how much to pack ? '
And they said , ` We do n't know . '
Jaime and I went from being together everyday to never seeing each other , still trying to hold our relationship together , which would be hard for anybody .
This song is our story . ''
The song is also about the changes that the Glorina trio has been through .
Gossin explained to The Boot : `` We 've gone through being normal people and playing music and trying to ` make it , ' so to speak , then we 've had a couple years of making it .
It 's about looking back after that and realizing what 's really important .
It 's not the spotlight , it 's the relationships you had . ''
