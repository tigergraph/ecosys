Thompson Square is an American Country music duo composed of husband and wife Keifer Thompson and Shawna Thompson .
The fourth single from their self-titled debut album was written by Ross Copperman and Jon Nite .
Copperman is an American singer-songwriter who is known by many for his song `` All She Wrote , '' which reached the top 40 of the UK singles chart in 2007 .
Texan Jon Nite is a singer/songwriter with roots planted in the music of West Texas , who has had tunes cut by Blake Shelton , Chris Young and Dierks Bentley .
Jon Nite recorded his own version of `` Glass , '' which was featured in the teen drama show One Tree Hill .
We see Shawna wearing a beautiful wedding dress in the song 's music video .
She told The Boot how she chose it herself : `` Right before we had to go down to Mobile , Alabama , to do a show , we had a meeting with our stylist , '' she recalled .
`` I left the meeting a little bit unsure about the dress that had been picked for the video .
So , we 're in Mobile , which is just like 50 miles from where I grew up and used to shop .
My mom was with me , so we went dress shopping at a bridal shop in Mobile .
The first one I tried on was perfect , so that 's the one you see in the video ! ''
The first time that the Thompsons heard `` Glass '' it was a male demo .
Keifer recalled to Billboard magazine : `` We loved the song .
I did n't feel like I could sell the song as well as Shawna could .
We switched it over , and she did a version of it that blew everybody out of the water .
It was absolutely the right move .
I think the fans are going to love it .
It 's a really fragile , intimate song that showcases Shawna 's vocal ability . ''
Fun Fact : When glass breaks , the cracks move faster than 3000 miles per hour .
