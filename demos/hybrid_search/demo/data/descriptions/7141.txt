This is the first single from Wonder , the 22nd album released by American Contemporary Christian music singer-songwriter Michael W. Smith .
In this song Smith acknowledges that the temptations are ever present for a Christian .
During his troubled teen years Smith found himself giving in to temptation easily as he gravitated toward alcohol and substance abuse .
Finally , in November 1979 , he suffered a nervous breakdown that led to his recommitment to Jesus Christ .
Said Smith : `` This is a great song , and I can say that 'cause I did n't write it .
My son , Ryan , introduced me to it , and I just lit up when I heard it .
That was over a year and a half ago , and I 'm still not tired of listening to the song .
That really set the tone for the whole album , And the whole bridge -- man , what a ride .
It actually just reminded me of me a little bit -- very , very pop but sort of taking a left turn on the bridge .
These writers are awesome , and I 'm really grateful that they like the song the way we cut it . ''
