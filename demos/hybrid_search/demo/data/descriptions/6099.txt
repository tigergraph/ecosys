This was the opening track from American musician Darius Rucker 's debut Country album Learn to Live .
Rucker penned this with Chris Stapleton and Learn to Live producer Frank Rogers .
He recalled on his record label 's website : `` I remember when Chris Stapleton and I wrote this : we 'd finished writing another song and we said let 's write one more - and this was it .
We did n't think much of it , but then Frank Rodgers got a hold of it .
It rocks now - I did n't think it was going to sound like that .
Truthfully , I thought it was castoff . ''
