Gloriana is an American country music group comprising brothers Tom and Mike Gossin , Rachel Reintert and former America 's Most Talented Kid winner , Cheyenne Kimball .
Their self-titled debut album was produced and co-written by Mike Serletic , the owner of Emblem Music Group .
Kimball described this song to Today 's Country Magazine as having , `` a Johnny Cash feel to it with the upright bass , traditional country . ''
This was the first song written by the Gossin brothers and Reintert and it helped get Gloriana a recording contract with Emblem .
Tom Gossin explained to The 9513 : `` I had met Matt -LRB- Serletic -RRB- a couple of years prior to that with my brother through a manager we had at the time .
This was maybe 2004 or 2005 .
And Matt had said that if we did anything cool in the future he 'd check it out .
So we wrote that song and felt it was really strong , and I said , ` Let 's send it to that Matt guy and see if he 's into this . '
It just so happened he was looking for a country act and an act to launch his new label .
So it worked out .
The timing was perfect .
You know , when they say a lot of the record business is luck and timing , that was one of those instances where we just happened to get to him at the exact right time .
And it all worked out . ''
