This is the last track on the album and at the ends it loops back to join in with the introduction to `` Light Nights , '' the opening track .
Weller explained to Uncut magazine July 2008 : `` I really wanted to make the album flow , to have all the tracks flowing into each other .
Also in these days where people are into downloading one track or two tracks , I just liked the idea that people would want to hear the whole record as a complete piece . ''
Paul Weller : `` There are a lot of mentions of the seasons in my songs , and this is another one .
We recorded it with the studio door open .
You get some beautiful sunsets down at the Barn .
When we finished the final track , there was a huge electrical storm , and we took the microphones outside to capture the sound of the rain falling .
It symbolizes the year coming full circle . ''
