Unlike the other tracks on the Country duo Steel Magnolia 's debut album , there is only one writer credited on this song : Joshua Scott Jones .
His musical partner/girlfriend Meghan Linsey writes many of their songs with him , and they also get contributions from other Nashville songwriters , including Lori McKenna .
Jones told us that this is one of his favorites on the album .
He explained : `` To me , it 's more personal and I think it 's cool anytime that people can sit back and connect with that imagery and the metaphors .
Maybe it 's not a song that you 'll hear the first time and go and love , but maybe a few times down the road when you 're sitting in your chair or taking a bath , or I do n't know what you 're doing -LRB- laughing -RRB- just when you 're in a listening type of mood .
It 's upbeat and fun .
It 's more of a poem put into a song . ''
When we spoke with Joshua Scott Jones in 2011 , he told us about this song .
Said Jones : `` To put it in a wider perspective , I 'll just say it 's about self-sabotaging and maybe behavior that you take on that is unhealthy .
Something that you 're doing over and over that 's not working , but you continue on that path because that 's all you 've known and that 's what you 've become comfortable with .
It could be about anything , including addiction or anything like that .
There may be a few lines in there that let you know , maybe , in particular what the song may be about .
But I think that just any kind of behavior like that or addiction , that 's what it 's about .
This is our first record , so I still want people to come to their own conclusions at first .
Down the road we 'll have a sit-down or something and talk more about it .
