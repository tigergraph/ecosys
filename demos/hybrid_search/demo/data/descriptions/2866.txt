Nelson was a glam rock band founded by Matthew and Gunnar Nelson , the identical twin sons of Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Famer Ricky Nelson .
This song , which was from their debut album After The Rain , went to # 1 and was the duo 's sole chart-topper , making them the only act with twins other than the Bee Gees to hit the top spot .
The Nelson family are listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the only family with three generations of # 1 hitmakers .
The twins are grandsons of 1930s Big Band leader Ozzie Nelson who had a # 1 hit with `` And Then Some . ''
Ozzie went on to marry his vocalist Harriet and they later became TV stars with their show The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet .
The show starred the entire family including their son Ricky Nelson who had two chart-toppers with `` Poor Little Fool '' and `` Travelin ' Man . ''
Thirty years later Matthew and Gunnar Nelson had their own # 1 with this song .
The song is said to have been developed from a riff Matthew came up with while looking at a photo of super model Cindy Crawford in Vogue magazine .
