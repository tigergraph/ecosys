This was the first single to be released from Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor , the fifth solo studio album by former White Zombie frontman Rob Zombie .
It was the first Rob Zombie album to feature drummer Ginger Fish who , with guitarist John 5 , was part of Marilyn Manson 's band .
Asked what the story is behind the album 's title , Rob told Revolver magazine : `` There 's no real story behind it .
I just thought of it one day .
With every album I 've ever made , we 'll get it basically one hundred percent done and everyone will go , ` OK , what 's the title ? '
And I 'm like , ' I do n't know what the fu -- in ' title is yet .
It has n't hit me . '
And then one day I 'll just blurt out , ` La Sexorcisto : Devil Music , Vol .
1 ! '
or ` Hellbilly Deluxe ! '
It 's the same with this one .
I have it written down somewhere , but I do n't remember doing it . ''
