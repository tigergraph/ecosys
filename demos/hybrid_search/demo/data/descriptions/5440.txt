In this song , Sam Phillips tries to tell her lover how she feels in a roundabout way : `` If I said I could leave you now and go where I could forget , I 'd be lying . ''
In our interview with Phillips , she talked about the nuts and bolts of the song : `` There were some philosophies going around and some self help that I did n't agree with , so I put that in a song .
It was a hodgepodge of that , but more of what the Tin Pan Alley writers call the classic laundry list song : you put a lot of different things in a list .
That was an unusual way to say it : ` I 'd be lying if I said this , this , this , this , this , and this . '
So I guess that would be the craft part of it , the ` behind the machine ' part of it . ''
Tin Pan Alley refers to the influential music publishers and songwriters based in large cities - usually New York - in the mid-19th to 20th centuries .
Phillips re-recorded this song for her digitally released Long Play series .
She told the Pop Matters website : `` I was never really happy with my performance of it on Cruel Inventions , I thought my vocal was too strident .
I wanted a softer approach , vocally , so I thought a stripped down version would be interesting , and I was really happy with how it turned out . ''
Elvis Costello was a guest performer - as guitarist - on the Cruel Inventions album .
