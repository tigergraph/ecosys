Lead singer Joe Strummer , who wrote the lyrics to the song , noted in promotional interviews for the album that he had been reading the poetry of Sylvia Plath , and the darkness of her writing could well have been an influence on the dark lyrics of `` The Card Cheat . ''
The lyrics continue the same themes of an outsider in society as other songs that proceeded it on the album , notably `` Jimmy Jazz , '' `` Rudie Ca n't Fail '' and `` Wrong 'Em Boyo . ''
Contrasting to those other songs , however , `` The Card Cheat '' is incredibly downbeat , with the jaunty piano tunes contrasting with the lyrics about a lonely gambler finally running out of luck and being murdered in a card game -LRB- `` The gambler is seized and forced to his knees and shot dead .
He only wanted more time away from his darkest door , but his luck , it gave in '' -RRB- .
Due to the complexity of the backing track compared to the band 's very spartan stage show , the song was never performed live by the Clash .
The song was recorded late in the London Calling sessions , and by this time according to reports , producer Guy Stevens was so inebriated he was unable to work most of the time , so guitarist Mick Jones was producing the recordings along with engineer Bill Price .
It was Mick 's idea to have everything in this song double-tracked , to create a Phil Spector-style `` wall-of-sound '' feel to the instrumentation -LRB- `` That 's the secret , two of everything '' he said in a 1991 interview -RRB- .
The song features a horn section written and performed by The Irish Horns , who recorded all of the horn instrument sections on the London Calling album .
