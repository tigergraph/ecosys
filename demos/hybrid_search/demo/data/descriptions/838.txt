Bassist Dave Ellefson -LRB- from MusicRadar.com -RRB- : `` Fast Lane was a funny one .
As a bass player , it was all about learning some fancy licks , going into the studio and having the producer say , ` Man , ca n't you just play some eighth notes ? '
-LSB- laughs -RSB- This song was me hunkering down and knocking it out and making my wrist a fulcrum .
I 'm just playing eighth notes , sixteenth notes , holding down the fort .
I got going and locked in with the drums , and pretty soon , I did n't even know the tune was over -- I was in the zone.Another cool driving song .
You put this one on in your car , and you 're flying . ''
