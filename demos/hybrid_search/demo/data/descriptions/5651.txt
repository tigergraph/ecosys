This is the opening track from English singer-songwriter Paul Weller 's eleventh solo album , Sonik Kicks .
It was recorded in Weller 's own Black Barn Studios in Ripley , Surrey , with co-producer Simon Dine and engineer Charles Rees .
Weller commented to Uncut magazine regarding the album 's influences : `` I 've been listening to a lot of free form music , call it electronica or whatever .
And I like Lou Reed 's Metal Machine Music , so I guess there 's a certain amount of influence , but more in textural and sonic terms .
There are some avantgarde and electronic elements that have been incorporated into the songs and there are a couple of soundscape pieces .
There 's an experimental edge to it , but with some good tunes . ''
The first version of Sonik Kicks was completed in March 2011 only to be rejected by Weller as `` too full-on . ''
So Weller removed four tracks , replacing them with the pastoral `` Sleep Of the Scene '' and `` By The Waters '' and recruited Stan Kybert to come in and strip the sound back a bit .
He explained to Uncut magazine : `` The first version was n't doing what the title said , it was n't sonic enough and it was n't kicking .
Stan really turned it round in the mix .
He was just ruthless with it and cut back a lot of stuff , making it cleaner and harder .
All that extreme stereo sonic trickery on ` Green ' was down to Stan .
And that crystallizes Sonik Kicks to me .
I would n't have been clever enough to think of it or do it . ''
Lyrically , this song is made up of a stream of free form half-spoken words .
Weller explained to Q magazine : `` There 's a track called ` Green ' that 's a sort of mad , stream-of-consciousness thing taken from lists of everything Dine and I saw on our journeys to the studio one day . ''
