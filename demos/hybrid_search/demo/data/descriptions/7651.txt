Shepherd 's juggling of her music career with being a mother was the inspiration for this song , which she penned for her second album Where Country Grows .
`` I opened my diary , and I got to an entry where I was writing about feeling bad , empty and sad , '' she explained .
`` After that , I 'd written , ` Well , I guess , I 'm just a woman . '
When I read that , I underlined it.The song does n't bash the man , '' she continued .
`` It 's saying , ` Buddy , I understand you pretty much 99 percent of the time .
I need you to understand me , too , sometimes , because I know I can be hard to deal with .
I need you to work with me , here , because I feel like I work with you . '
It gives women a lot of credit .
I think about our mommas , and it makes me get chill bumps , because I feel like I 've written an anthem for them . ''
