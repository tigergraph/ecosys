This lighthearted Music Hall style song written by Ray Davies carries a very sad theme : a performer shows up drunk for an important gig , against the advice of his manage , where he is scorned to the point where he is too embarrassed to show his face in public .
For days , he goes around in disguise before he recovers and starts performing again .
The Kinks did not have as many problems with drugs or alcohol as other bands of the '60s did , although Ray Davies later admitted to taking drugs when he was in art college and going through a period of alcoholism around 2001 .
This song uses two time signatures : 6/8 time for the jumpy verse sections , and 3/4 for the slower choruses .
