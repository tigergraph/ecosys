This ode to getting away in the summer is the second single from American country artist Blaine Larsen 's third studio album , Not Too Bad .
Larsen penned the song with Phil O'Donnell and Ed Hill .
The trio crafted the song in an office on Music Row .
Larsen recalled to The Boot the original inspiration that got their creative wheels turning .
`` I remember coming up with the idea because everybody says it all the time : ` We 're just chillin ' .
We 're gon na go chill out , ' '' he explained .
`` So , I heard it a bunch and thought , ` Man , that 's got to be a song . ' ''
Larsen told The Boot about the song : `` It 's about summertime , and everybody 's ready to get out and have a couple of drinks and relax , get out on the boat or head down to the islands or to the beach , '' he said .
`` So this song is one that I 'm hoping a lot of folks will crank up and play while they 're doing all that stuff .
It takes you away for a few minutes , and we 've got a lot of stuff going on in the world right now that nobody really wants to dwell on , so this is something to get people 's minds off of it . ''
