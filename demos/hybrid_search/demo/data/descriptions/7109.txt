This song is about Hadley Richardson Hemingway , who was married to American author Ernest Hemingway between 1921 and 1927 .
Carpenter explained the inspiration for the song to Express Night Out : `` This song was something I 've been wanting to write , or investigate , since I was in college .
That 's when I first read -LSB- the Ernest Hemingway memoir -RSB- A Moveable Feast .
Last summer , a new edition came out that was edited by Hemingway 's second wife 's grandson , and the critics ' notices indicated it might be more favorable to her than the first edition .
I found it to be so - it was more favorable .
But what got my attention was that his first wife , Hadley , was sort of a shadowy figure in literary history and his life .
I was always fascinated by her .
People are aware of the story that he fell in love with her best friend and left -LSB- her -RSB- .
This is a song about her life in Paris with him , before all of that happened .
In A Moveable Feast he looks back to his life in Paris with Hadley , before the fame , the money , and the corruption if you will , and he always seemed to indicate that that 's when he did his best work .
And it 's as if he lost his way and his ability to do that after that magical time was over . ''
Red-haired Hadley Richardson -LRB- 1891-1979 -RRB- was eight years older than Ernest Hemingway .
They first encountered each other in December 1920 after Hadley visited her old roommate Smith and through her met Hemingway , who was living with Smith 's brother .
They married the following year after a whirlwind courtship and had one son together , John .
When Hemingway fell in love with Hadley 's friend , the blonde and wealthy Pauline Pfeiffer Richardson agreed to a divorce if the two were still in love after not seeing each other for 100 days .
During their three month separation , Hemingway wrote much of Men Without Women .
