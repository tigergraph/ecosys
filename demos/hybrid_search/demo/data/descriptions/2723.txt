This is the title track of Contemporary Christian Music singer/songwriter Chris August 's second studio album , which was released August 21 , 2012 .
The LP was dropped just four months after August sustained a brain injury from a skateboarding accident .
Its title parallels the healing process , during which he embraced the ` upside of down . '
Said August : `` Even in the ` down ' part of life , I 've had such intimate moments with friends being at my house and lifting me in prayer ; I 'm really connecting with Christ on a new level .
I could n't ask for anything else through all this ! ''
