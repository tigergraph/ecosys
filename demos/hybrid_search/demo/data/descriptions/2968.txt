This is a track from English indie rock band , The Cribs ' third studio album , Men 's Needs , Women 's Needs , Whatever .
The song is included on the soundtrack of the 2008 action movie , Never Back Down .
The song features a spoken word contribution from Sonic Youth 's Lee Ranaldo , in which he rails against the ills of the modern world .
He recalled to Mojo magazine October 2009 : `` They wanted to challenge themselves , go out on a limb .
They gave me this pop song and said , ` We want you to talk over it . '
I could n't see how it would work .
I was apprehensive but it fell into place . ''
Bassist Gary Jarman recalled to NME in a 2013 interview how the song has become one of the band 's most popular numbers : `` It was a weird one , '' he said .
`` We were trying to be a bit more leftfield , but rather than it being this anonymous thing we ca n't leave it out of the set . ''
