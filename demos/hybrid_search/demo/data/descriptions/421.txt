This is the title track from the fourth studio album by Katie Melua .
The Georgian-born British singer-songwriter originally penned almost an album 's worth of material in a matter of weeks , only to discard it .
`` Those songs were me dealing with a lot of personal emotions in a very dark way , '' she told The Sunday Times .
`` I got heavily into poets like Anne Carson and Alice Notley , and , I suppose , tried to write a bit like them .
I overflourished .
I loved the lyrics I 'd written , but only as pieces of poetry .
As words to put to music , they did n't work .
`` Only this slow , mournful track survived the cull , Melua scrapped the rest and started again , working with several other songwriters , including Robbie Williams 's long-time writing partner , Guy Chambers , Melua 's friend Polly Scattergood , and Grammy / Ivor Novello award winning songwriter/producer , Rick Nowels.Melua told The Daily Telegraph May 5 , 2010 : `` If this album is about something , it 's the puzzle of being alive , the mind maze of going inside your head and trying to figure out what the hell is going on in there .
