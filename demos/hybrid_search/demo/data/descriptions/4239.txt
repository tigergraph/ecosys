Bassist/vocalist Les Claypool came up with this song 's riff whilst noodling around at home .
He told MusicRadar : `` I had that sitting around for a while .
If I 'm home and I come up with something , I 'll try to record it , but a lot of the time I 'll forget to .
A lot of things go off into space and never come back 'cause I just do n't remember them .
Lee Van Cleef stuck around .
I came up with it on my Dobro bass and really liked it , so I recorded it . ''
The album title is lifted from a line in this song : `` A yellow Studebaker with a 302/With a seat of Green Naugahyde . ''
It refers to a form of plastic leather used for seats .
Claypool explained to Artist Direct : `` That was my father 's pickup truck when I was a kid .
Years later , I actually ran that pickup truck into the side of a liquor store because the driver 's door flew open as I was making a right turn ... The ol' Studebaker is no longer with us , but there were a lot of fond memories in that vehicle .
I come from a long line of auto mechanics , and naugahyde was what people had on their couches because they could n't afford leather .
The circles I ran in , we saw a lot of naugahyde , the '70s working-class leather . ''
Lee Van Cleef -LRB- 1925 -- 1989 -RRB- was an American film actor who is best known for his roles in spaghetti westerns , particularly Sergio Leone 's For a Few Dollars More and The Good , The Bad and The Ugly .
