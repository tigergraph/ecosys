This song is meant to be a `` call to action '' of sorts , but Our Lady Peace lead singer Raine Maida insists that it 's not meant to be a political song .
When we interviewed Maida in 2012 , he told us that the line `` recalculate what we got wrong '' in the song speaks to the need for change in society .
In this song , lead singer Raine Maida refers to the current state of the world as `` Shangri-La in reverse . ''
Maida explained to us that the reference is supposed to allude to the times when the Native Americans ruled North America because that was the last time he believes our society was close to being Shangri-La .
Maida says those times were about living off the land and giving back to the land to attain peace and tranquility , but adds , `` now we 've lost it .
We 've gone completely in the opposite direction . ''
When talking about the themes of this song in 2012 , Raine Maida said , `` I 'm not a denier of climate change ; the whole Occupy thing for me was profound in the sense that the idea itself is still gestating .
There 's the initial movement , but it was more about the idea .
I think it 's still happening and hopefully we 'll start to see some change with the new election starting in the States , for sure . ''
