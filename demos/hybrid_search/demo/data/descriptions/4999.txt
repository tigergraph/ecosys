Madeleine Peyroux co-wrote this song with the producer Larry Klein , who is the ex-husband and longtime collaborator of Joni Mitchell , and Steely Dan 's Walter Becker .
The work of the Buddhist nun Pema Chodron was an influence on this song , which explores Peyroux 's troubled relationship with her alcoholic father , who died in 2005 .
Chodron 's books apply Buddhist teachings in everyday life and encourage readers to accept and embrace pain and suffering as part of the human condition .
In her 1996 book When Things Fall Apart : Heart Advice for Difficult Times , Chodron writes : `` Ca n't we just return to the bare bones ?
Relaxing with the present , relaxing with the hopelessness , relaxing with death , not resisting the fact that things end , that things pass , that things have no lasting substance , that everything changes -- that is the basic message . ''
Peyroux explained to The Daily Telegraph April 9 , 2009 : `` I was interested in the toughness of her writing .
She says : instead of having a magnet on your refrigerator saying ` Every day in every way we 're getting better and better ' have something on your wall that says : ` abandon all hope ' .
Which I thought was quite brilliant . ''
Peyroux added : `` The phrase ` bare bones ' evokes much more to me than a lack of material things .
It 's the skeleton of what 's really going on .
And I realize that 's the lifestyle I 've lived , that I 've seen others live . ''
