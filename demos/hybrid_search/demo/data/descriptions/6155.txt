This doom-ridden piece of electronica was inspired by the 1991 film Thelma & Louise .
Vocalist James Allan explained to the Sunday Mail : `` I was thinking about the movie Thelma & Louise , two women living in the suburbs who go on a road trip .
This song is about two women who see each other often and start talking to each other .
They find that they go through the same thing in life .
But there is a shadow in their lives .
Then one convinces the other to run away one night . ''
The song should not be confused with John Lennon 's 1974 similarly titled collaboration with Elton John , `` Whatever Gets You Thru The Night . ''
