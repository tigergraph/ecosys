This song speaks of the instant gratification attitude many Americans have .
The lyrics , `` Everyone 's got ta to have the sicknessCause everyone seems to need the cure '' shows the want for something .
It 's saying .
`` Fix me .
I do n't want to take the time out of my day to find out what 's wrong , you do it ! ''
