Recorded onstage , backstage , in three different hotel rooms , and on a Continental Silver Eagle tour bus during a cross-country tour in 1977 , the Running on Empty album is a paean to life on the road .
The title track , along with `` The Load-Out/Stay , '' was recorded live during a concert at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia , Maryland on August 27 , 1977 .
-LRB- thanks , Charles - Charlotte , NC -RRB- In August 2008 , lifelong Democrat Jackson Browne filed a lawsuit against Republican presidential candidate John McCain , after the politician used a portion of this song in a presidential campaign TV ad without permission .
Browne 's lawyer Lawrence Iser said : `` Not only have Senator McCain and his agents plainly infringed Mr. Browne 's copyright in ` Running on Empty , ' but the Federal Courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singer 's voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singer 's right of publicity .
`` While MCain had every right to play the song at campaign rallies , synching it up to video requires special permission , which is why songs used in commercials , movies and TV shows must be cleared .
`` Running On Empty '' is a popular metaphor for being exhausted , but the phrase had a much more literal meaning for Browne when it came to him .
According to Rolling Stone magazine 's 500 Greatest Songs , Browne wrote this while he was driving back and forth to the studio each day to make his album The Pretender .
He said , `` I was always driving around with no gas in the car , I just never bothered to fill up the tank because - how far was it anyway ?
Just a few blocks . ''
