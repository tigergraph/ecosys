The third single from English rapper Wretch 32 finds him in more of a mellow mood after the more gritty and clubby sounds of his previous two releases .
He told Digital Spy : `` This third single is n't the easiest or most obvious choice , but I think it 's starting to connect with people , which is all I want to do really .
This type of sound is what I was known for making on my old CDs and mixtapes .
I like heartfelt music , but I wanted to initially come out with something for the clubs and festivals . ''
Speaking to The Sun , Wretch compared the lyrical skill of him and his Hip-Hop contemporaries to the original Bard .
`` Shakespeare was an expert at storytelling , coming up with similes and metaphors , '' he said .
`` The ability to be speaking about one thing , while actually referring to something else , is one thing that he did brilliantly .
And that 's what a good rapper should be able to do .
We 're always using double meaning , '' Wretch added.Wretch went on to explore the similarities between him and Shakespeare , stating : `` Take my track ` Do n't Go ' , which was , on the surface , a love song .
But I actually wrote it about my love for music .
At first , when I told people that , they did n't get it at all but , after a few listens , it clicked .
And that 's something that Shakespeare started . ''
The song features the soulful vocals of Josh Kumra , who is a singer-songwriter that hails from Swindon .
