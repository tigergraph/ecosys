This is the first promotional single from Estonian electro-pop singer Kerli 's second album .
She explained the song 's meaning in an interview with PopEater : `` At first I wanted to name the album ` Weapons of Mass Creation , ' and I started making the whole album very hard and army-themed , but ` The Army of Love , ' when I wrote the song I saw the visual .
I saw massive guns shooting beautiful stuff .
I wanted to create a concept to explain that love and innocence actually are the most beautiful things .
An army just sounds really violent and forceful , but we fight with love . ''
The video was filmed over several days in Estonia during early November 2010 .
Kaimar Kukk -LRB- Caviar Productions -RRB- directed the clip , which `` sets the undertone of -LSB- her -RSB- entire new album . ''
