This song finds Rock exploring how despite his fame , he still experiences loneliness .
`` I just pictured myself having an honest conversation in the mirror ... you know , Bob Richie talking to Kid Rock .
But it 's not , you know , ` Oh , I 'm so successful and I feel alone , '' he told MTV News .
Long-term studio cohort and co-engineer Al Sutton told Detroit Free Press : `` There was a specific vibe on this , and we spent a lot of time to get the right take .
The next day -LRB- Kid Rock -RRB- comes and decides to take the drums out of the first half .
It was kind of funny - we 'd spent so much time on it .
But his instinct was right on . ''
