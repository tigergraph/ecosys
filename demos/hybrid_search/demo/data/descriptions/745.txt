During the Wisconsin stop of Corbin 's Summer 2008 tour , he recounted the story of this song : `` My birthday was on February 21st .
On that day I was in the recording studio .
I was working .
I did n't get to see a lot of my family and friends or anything because I was working , which was cool - I love working .
It was really wonderful , I have a lot of family and friends leaving a lot of great messages , they just said some really great words and just got me feeling really good and all mushy and gushy .
And I just wanted to write something about it . ''
Corbin performed this song at the Kids ' Inaugural Party for Michelle Obama and the first daughters in January 2009 .
He told The San Francisco Chronicle that this was one of the most nerve-wracking things that he 's ever done .
`` I was nervous , man , '' he said .
`` I do n't get nervous too much when it comes to performing .
I 've been doing it my whole life , and it 's what I love to do .
But that was definitely one that I was freaking out a little bit about . ''
Corbin added : `` One thing that I really remember happened during the performance .
I went down to the audience and sang to the girls a bit .
When I walked up to Michelle , she kind of freaked out a little bit , pretending like she was a young teenager .
I already liked her a lot , but I thought that was really awesome . ''
This featured on the soundtrack of Corbin 's movie Free Style .
