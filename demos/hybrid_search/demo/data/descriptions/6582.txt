This was released as a single from British pop singer Charli XCX 's debut album True Romance .
The song was written by Charli with Justin Ralsen and co-written , produced , engineered and mixed by Ariel Rechsthaid .
It was previously released on her You 're the One EP .
The album 's title is taken from the 1993 film of the same name , which is sampled on `` Velvet Dreaming '' from Charli 's Super Ultra mixtape .
The singer told The Sun that she thinks the movie 's main protagonist 's `` are two of the best romantic heroes ever . ''
Charli explained the song 's meaning to Artist Direct : `` It 's about being in a state of decay , '' she said .
`` It 's like when you 're caught in a space where you not sure what to do or where to go .
You know you 're there and lost .
You know you have to survive and get out , but you do n't know how .
That 's what it 's about .
I imagine that song in particular is really purple and hazy .
When I think about that song , I imagine being in a field of lavender with purple clouds and stuff like that . ''
The song was featured on a season six episode of Gossip Girl .
Charli 's birth name is Charlotte Aitchison .
She told The Sun of the ` XCX ' part of her stage moniker : `` When I was younger , XCX was my MSN screen name and it just kind of stuck . ''
