City and Colour is the recording alias of Canadian singer-songwriter Dallas Green .
This was released on April 1 , 2013 as the lead single from The Hurry And The Harm on City and Colour 's Soundcloud page .
Green 's lyrics about being `` gracefully cursed '' were penned with Kimbra in mind and were something he had little connection to emotionally . ''
` Thirst ' proved to me , which is something that I 've always struggled with , that I could write a song , a good song that I like , and it does n't necessarily have to be about something horrible that happened to me , '' he told The Huffington Post .
`` For the longest time , I did n't think I could write songs unless it was cathartic . ''
Green originally wrote this for New Zealand singer-songwriter Kimbra .
It was the first time that Green had been approached to pen something for another artist .
`` My first thought when I was asked was , ` I ca n't do this . '
And then an hour later I wrote something , '' he told The Huffington Post .
After not hearing back from Kimbra 's people , he decided to record the song as his own .
