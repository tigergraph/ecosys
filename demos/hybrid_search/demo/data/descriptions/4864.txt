Normally a foghorn signals danger , but in this case it means he is close to home and his love .
The original title was `` Into the Misty . ''
This was played in the 1989 Mary Stuart Masterson movie Immediate Family .
She played a woman who was young and pregnant and planning to give her baby to Glenn Close and James Woods , who could n't have a baby of their own .

There is room for interpretation beyond the superficial meaning .
It might be interpreted as expressing an understanding that life is finite -LRB- the ship sailing on its round trip -RRB- and must be lived to its fullest -LRB- `` I want to rock your Gypsy soul '' -RRB- , and an acceptance of its inevitable end -LRB- `` We will magnificently float into the mystic , when the foghorn blows I will be coming home '' -RRB- .
When you have seen the world and loved someone , you should have no reason to fear the end because you have lived your life to the fullest .
