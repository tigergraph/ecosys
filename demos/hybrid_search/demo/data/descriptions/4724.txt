When introducing this song to a live audience , singer/songwriter Roger Clyne says : `` This is dedicated to a special breed of people who run those fiberglass boats on the Sea of Cortez , which is just south of where we live .
And they bring us all the stuff that we do want , and then anything that we do want that we might not necessarily need .
Here 's to them and their special brand of courage . ''
The word-of-mouth channel The Peacemakers use for their advertising is much like running contraband .
Their advertising is peer-to-peer as opposed to major media advertising .
They are an independent band , Clyne says , and as such they must work extra hard to get their music to an audience .
In a DailyCamera.com podcast , Clyne endorses the Internet wholeheartedly , saying , `` The Internet is so powerful now that everyone is connected with everyone .
The music can make it from the artist to the fan without having to go through the promotional segment of a big record company .
The music can get from the artist to the fan unfiltered . ''
The downside to that , he says , is that the Internet is so clogged it makes it more difficult for the artist to get their work to the forefront .
That , however , opens new channels to get creative about how to bring the music to an audience , a concept Clyne embraces .
New people are continually being introduced to Peacemakers music through their live shows , where Clyne works to create community , to blur the line between band and audience , and spread their message through their `` contraband . ''
