Pleasure P explained to BlackVibes.com that this song `` is telling guys that whatever you wo n't do , another guy will do .
A lot of girls have a boyfriend # 2 because men sometimes forget and we do n't pay attention to our girl like we should .
We do n't give her flowers anymore .
We just get real comfortable . ''
Pleasure P clarified to MTV News : `` I 'm not encouraging people to cheat on this record .
What I 'm saying is I 'm sending a message , step up your game .
You see in the video , the average guy gets the girl because the guy with the money was n't treating her right .
Do n't stop giving her flowers and saying , ` Baby , how was your day ?
, ' and telling her how you feel .
-LSB- If you do n't -RSB- , another man will . ''
This was the second single released from former Pretty Ricky member Pleasure P 's debut solo album The Introduction of Marcus Cooper .
He explained why he titled the album after his birth name : `` The reason I named it that is because Pretty Ricky introduced you all to Pleasure P , but now Pleasure P is going to introduce you to Marcus Cooper , which is my government name .
This time , I 'm in my own lane musically - I 'm grown up now .
I 'm talking about things that average R&B guys do n't talk about but that average people can relate to .
Pretty Ricky was overly raunchy , young and with no direction .
Now , my music is classier and I 'll tell you exactly how it is . ''
