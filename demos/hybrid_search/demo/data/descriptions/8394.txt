Released as a single in Australia , where it charted at # 27 , `` When You Come '' was written by group leader Neil Finn for the band 's second album .
Finn says the song made more sense to him as he got older .
In 1998 , he explained to Goldmine `` I 'd done it a couple of times before , but that was the first time I was conscious of a real stream-of-consciousness lyric .
Images just fell out one on top of another .
I did n't , at the time , think it was all that connected -- but actually , now , it seems like quite a coherent statement .
I was just juxtaposing the natural world with a personal ... pledge , really , I suppose . ''
