In 2008 , this song became the theme song for professional wrestler Randy Orton .
It was made to fit his demented character , who in January 2009 , was diagnosed -LRB- not in real life -RRB- with IED , a disorder characterized by anger and rage .
When the song was released on iTunes in 2011 , it was billed to Rich Luzzi , Rev Theory 's lead singer , rather than the band itself .
-LRB- thanks , Guy - New York , NY -RRB-
