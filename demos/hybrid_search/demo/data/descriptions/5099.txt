This slice of digital dancehall is a lyrical collaboration between multi-instrumentalist/producer Rostam Batmangli and frontman Ezra Koenig .
At just over six minutes , it is the longest song Vampire Weekend have produced to date .
The song features a percussive vocal sample from M.I.A. 's `` Hussel '' and an interpolation of `` Pressure Drop '' by the Toots and the Maytals .
Batmangli commented in the band 's track-by-track production notes : `` I started making this song in my living room .
At one point my roommate walked in and turned on the kitchen faucet , you can hear it running behind the guitar solo . ''
Batmanglij detailed the story behind the song during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session in 2013 : `` Ezra sent me a short story called ` Diplomat 's Son ' when we were in college , '' he recalled .
`` The last paragraph read : ' I wondered , watching him bleeding on the rugby field beneath my mud-covered boot , if he was looking at me through the proscenium of a Turkish taxicab 's rumbling windshield or , perhaps , the small port window of the rickety boat which had taken him down the Ganges . '
`` Years later , '' he continued , `` I started working on a song on my own , this was between our first and our second albums , I knew I wanted two distinct parts with two really distinct grooves but both Jamaican in feel .
`` I started to take the idea of the ` Diplomat 's Son ' and put it in a different context .
I started to look at it as more of a love story than a story about competitive students .
I had a vocal melody and lyrics for the chorus : ` He was a diplomat 's son , It was ' 81 ' .
`` Then Ezra and I got in the studio and started working on fleshing out the song : writing a verse , and pre-chorus together .
More sections after that .
Figuring out some vocals for the bridge as well .
`` We added CT on drums , Baio on Bass ... and the rest is history . ''
