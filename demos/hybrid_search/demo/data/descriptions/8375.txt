The third single from Third Strike is a summer anthem that was inspired by Bajan babe , Rihanna .
`` We feel it 's a little different from the usual Wanted sound , '' said Tom Parker , `` we 've stripped it back to pure pop , it 's just a feel-good , fun track . ''
The song 's music video spoofs three classic boyband promos , starting with * N Sync 's puppetry visual for `` Bye Bye Bye , '' then the matching white suited Backstreet Boys ' clip for `` I Want It That Way '' and finally Take That 's black and white film for `` Back For Good , '' which saw the quintet walking and dancing in the rain while wearing long coats .
Tom Parker told The Daily Mirror : `` Fun is a good way to describe the video ... it has got a lot of character . ''
The Wanted worked with Dr. Luke on the track .
The American producer has previously worked with the likes of Katy Perry , Britney Spears and Kelly Clarkson .
Asked by MTV UK whether Rihanna had heard the song , Tom Parker replied : `` We met her manager Jay Brown in New York and he said that he really liked it and that she really liked it which is always a good sign 'cause if she hated it we 'd be in a pretty bad place . ''
