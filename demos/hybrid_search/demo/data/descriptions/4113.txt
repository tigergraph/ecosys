Frontman Justin Pierre recalled to Spin that when he originally tried to record his vocal for this song it , `` just was n't working . ''
He explained it was because , `` the lyrics were too gross and too personal '' and guitarist Josh Cain , `` said it literally made his stomach sick .
`` So Pierre changed the lyric from , `` rushing into every pore , the whiskey stench of open sores , '' to `` scattered seeds of sycamore , '' which , he said , `` is a little prettier , more palatable . ''
