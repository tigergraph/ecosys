This is the title track of Nelly Furtado 's fourth English-language studio album .
Furtado explained that the Rodney `` Darkchild '' Jerkins produced song , `` is an ode to the spirit , which resides in all of us and triumphs over anything .
It is inspired by people I have met , and special moments in history that I have read about . ''
`` This song means a lot of things to me , '' explained Furtado in a behind the scenes clip for the video , `` because it does have a lot of spirit to it and a lot of positivity to it .
It 's meant to be empowering .
It 's meant to be a tribute to all of us : we all have an indestructible spirit . ''
`` It 's got an elemental theme , '' she continued .
`` I love nature .
My first video ever was in nature , ` I 'm Like a Bird . '
So I do see this new album as sort of a coming home into the original reason why I make music in the first place , with is to have fun and rejoice . ''
Spirituality is one of the underlying themes on the Spirit Indestructible album .
Furtado told the Mail On Sunday that a trip to Kenya that she undertook in 2011 , `` was an awakening . ''
The Portuguese-Canadian songstress explained : `` I was invited there to shoot a documentary about a high school for girls in a region where very few girls are educated .
In Africa , I really remembered who I am .
I was raised Catholic , but I see myself as more spiritual than religious .
I was able to come home and write all these lyrics , so there are songs on the album about God . ''
Furtado released an additional lyric video for the song , which tells the inspiring story of Spencer West , a double amputee who climbed Mount Kilimanjaro using only his hands .
`` Spencer has just finished an incredible climb up Mount Kilimanjaro to raise awareness and financial support for clean water projects in Africa , '' said Furtado .
`` Spencer is a true hero who knows how to ` redefine his possible ' every day .
I wrote this song in tribute to humanity , as I believe we are all capable of triumphing over whatever obstacle life brings .
The spirit indestructible is in all of us .
People like Spencer have proven this to me . ''
