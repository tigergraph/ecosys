This was the first single by English singer/songwriter , Peter Andre , from his sixth solo studio album , Control .
Andre wrote the song himself and the lyrics appear to be a reflection on his much-publicised failed marriage to Katie Price .
In an interview with Richard Bacon on BBC Radio 5 Live , it was put to Andre that the single might be seen as benefiting from the publicity surrounding his break-up with the tabloid star .
The singer denied this was the case , saying : `` You 're always going to be in a bit of a no-win situation because this single was written a long time ago ... I 'm talking about eight months , nine months ago - it was always going to come out this summer . ''
