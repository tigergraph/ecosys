Vocalist Ryan Clark on bandsonfire.com about this song written from Demon Hunter 's Christian perspective : `` This song , although seemingly very sad and depressing , is in actuality a love letter to my friends and family .
It is essentially something that I would want them all to know if I were to die .
I ask my true friends to carry my casket down the aisle , and as they lay me into the ground , not to mourn for my soul , but rather rejoice for my salvation .
Death can be viewed as a very negative thing , but for Christians , it is where we find our true hope .
Death is never something I would take lightly or toy with , but to address it I think can be very revealing .
If you never spoke of the reality of death , you would be ignoring such an important part of life .
This song asks my friends and family to ` save sorrow for the souls in doubt , ' for they know that my soul is safe . ''
