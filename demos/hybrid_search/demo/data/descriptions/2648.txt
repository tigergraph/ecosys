This song is about the Winter Storms that hit Southern Ontario/Northern New York in 1977 .
The band grew up in Saint Catharines , Ontario and it was in an area that was hit the worst by the storms .
Even though the band members were born after the storms , their parents lived through it and they 've grown up hearing stories about what happened and decided to write the song about the storm , seeing as it had affected their parents and surrounding area in such a large way .
