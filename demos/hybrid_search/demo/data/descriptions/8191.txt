Jewel -LRB- from her website -RRB- : `` This is a rocker .
Theme is finding someone you can believe in and hanging on .
We did a cool treatment in the first chorus , where instead of building into an even bigger chorus , we do the opposite and drop everything out except acoustic guitar and my voice .
It creates a dramatic and unexpected effect . ''
