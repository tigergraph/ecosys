Lead singer Thom Yorke : `` This is about sex in the morning .
It 's the best time to have it .
Especially if you have brushed your teeth before . ''
According to Q magazine April 2008 , this track was initially regarded as B-side material recorded by the studio 's assistant engineer Nigel Godrich .
However Godrich , who was to become the band 's regular producer , bonded with the band and it was promoted onto the album after a playback .
John Leckie , who produced The Bends , was away the day the band recorded this .
The result is a more raw and improvised sound then the rest of the album .
