George Harrison was interviewed in depth for the September 6 , 1975 issue of Melody Maker ; his new album was also reviewed by the same journalist , Ray Coleman.According to this , `` Tired Of Midnight Blue '' was originally called `` Midnight Blue '' , but Melissa Manchester got the title first .
As she did , but only just!The song was written after a night out with record industry executives in Los Angeles , something that Harrison found less than inspiring .
Running to 4 minutes 51 seconds , the song is the eighth track - track 3 of side 2 - on the Extra Texture -LRB- Read All About It -RRB- album .
Leon Russell , who was a top session man , played piano on it .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 2 -RRB-
