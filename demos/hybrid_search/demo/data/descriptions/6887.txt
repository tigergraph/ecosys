Dar Williams ' ninth studio album , In the Time of Gods , has a theme of Greek mythology running through it .
The Chappaqua , New York native got the idea whilst driving on an isolated highway , on a trip from New York to Ontario .
`` I thought , ' I want to write a biker song !
, ' '' she recalled with a laugh .
`` And then my second thought was , ' I want to write an epic biker song . '
The Greek messenger of the dead is named Hermes , and I want to write about him - the god of travelers and thieves.I had this picture of Hermes starting to take a silver-haired woman down to her death , as she 's asked him to do , and instead he seduces her , saying ' I love people like you who are experienced and worldly , ' '' she added .
`` And then I thought , why do n't I really freak out my record company and make a whole album about Greek mythology ?
So I decided to look at each of the gods of the Parthenon and see if their stories sprang to life for me or not . ''
This was the first song Williams penned after coming up with the concept .
