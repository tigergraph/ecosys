The song 's title is taken from a book called In The Heart of the Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick , which is about a Nantucket ship that the story of Moby Dick came from .
Frontman Dave King told Alternative Press magazine : `` You hear old sailors saying , ` You never take the sea for granted . '
I feel the same way about life .
It 's a song about being aware of your surroundings and treating them with respect , because they can always chew you up and spit you out . ''
