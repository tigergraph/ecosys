A live version of this song serves as the B-side to one of the UK versions of the `` Buddy Holly '' single .
This version of the song was recorded in New York City in December 1994 .
Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo once called this song `` a total sarcastic call to hedonism , to sing along , drink and be merry .
I hate drinking and only do so when I absolutely have to . ''
A demo of the song was recorded during the sessions for Weezer 's third demo , entitled The Real Demo .
Unfortunately , the band felt that the demo was missing something , so it was only included on a few copies of the original tape .
The Real Demo was only circulated to friends and family of the band , but over the years , bootlegs of this recording have surfaced .
When Weezer plays this song in their live shows , some hardcore fans shout `` Smoke Dope ! ''
during the song 's breakdown as a reference to an unruly fan that can be heard shouting the same thing in the 1994 live version .
During The Blue Album and Pinkerton tours of the early and mid '90s , this song was Weezer 's go-to show closer .
As of 2012 , the band has been known to play this song live in almost every concert they do as it 's become a fan favorite .
An early version of this song features an alternate bridge section instead of the familiar breakdown of the album version .
