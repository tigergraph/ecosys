Robbie Robertson was the guitarist and primary songwriter with one of rock music 's preeminent groups , The Band .
In 1976 , he announced he would be exiting the group due to the stresses of sixteen years of touring .
This song marks the first time Robbie Robertson publicly addressed his decision to leave The Band .
He explained to Mojo magazine : `` I did n't want to make a statement .
I 'm just saying , ` This is what happened , ' and I 'm telling pieces of the story ... good storytelling leaves something to the imagination , too .
That 's why the first line of the song is n't ` This is a song about The Band . ' ''
In the chorus , Robertson sings , `` I know where I went wrong ` long the way . ''
He explained the lyric in an interview with Spinner : `` You go wrong when you follow a path that you do n't feel true to .
People grow in different directions and when you find out you 're not in the right place at the right time , you have to do what 's true to you .
You ca n't do things because they 're expected of you or because that 's what somebody else wants to do ; you have to find your own path . ''
