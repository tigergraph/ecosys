The Any Man in America album chronicles the dissolution of vocalist Justin Furstenfeld 's marriage and separation from his daughter .
The singer explained : `` I decided to document everything .
If I messed up along the way , I 'd tell that too .
I called the album my ` Audio Journal ' as I was writing .
I did n't want the music to just be about me though .
I wanted it to help other fathers in America who might be going through the same thing . ''
A video for this song directed by Merritt Fields was posted by Blue October on June 9 , 2011 on YouTube .
Due to the overwhelming positive response to the clip by fans , the band released the song on iTunes five days later just in time for Father 's Day .
