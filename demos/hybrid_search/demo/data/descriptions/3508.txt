This song details the feelings the band had about touring .
The band was very exhausted through the years leading up to this song 's release , aggressively touring and traveling to promote their records .
They spent far more time away from their homes , families and friends than they wanted to .
The band wrote this song to themselves , to keep themselves in positive spirits throughout their long trips touring on the road , a tone clearly represented in the song itself .
All the songs by Rush are written by drummer Neil Peart since his joining in 1974 , with a couple exceptions , this being one of them .
This song 's writing credits go to all 3 band members .
They wrote it while they were on tour riding around in a rental car near St. Louis .
