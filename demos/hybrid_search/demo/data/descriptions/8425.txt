This song is about a girl who is being abused by her boyfriend or husband until she ca n't take it anymore and kills him .
It then goes on to say `` She falls to her knees screaming God Please make something of me .
'Cause I 've never wanted anything like what I want to be right now , an angel again , an angel again , somehow , '' showing how she never wants to go back to that and would like to become an angel .
It goes on to conclude that with all the weight and pain , the original decision was right .
