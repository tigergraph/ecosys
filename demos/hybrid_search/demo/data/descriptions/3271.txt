In 2004 , lead singer Anthony Kiedis released his autobiography , which was titled Scar Tissue .
In the book , he explained some of the lyrics : `` Sarcastic Mr. Know-it-all '' is Dave Navarro , whom Anthony refers to as `` the King of sarcasm . ''
`` With the birds I 'll share this lonely view '' was inspired by birds that Anthony saw while he was singing outside of Flea 's house , and he also says that the line has to do with how he felt like an outsider , looking in .
Anthony was introduced to pot when he was 12 , but he first got high when he was 4 .
He was walking down the street with his dad , and his dad blew pot smoke in his face .
-LRB- thanks , Paul - PoCo , Canada -RRB- This won a Grammy for Best Rock Song .
-LRB- thanks , Tom - Trowbridge , England , for above 2 -RRB- The line , `` Close your eyes and I 'll kiss you 'cause , '' Anthony Kiedis is referring to guitarist Dave Navarro , and how in the music video for `` Warped '' -LRB- off the One Hot Minute album -RRB- , they both kiss at the end of the video .
-LRB- thanks , Andrew - Garden City , NY -RRB- The video shows the band driving through a desert .
It was directed by French director Stephane Sednaoui , who also directed the videos for `` Around the World '' and `` Give It Away . ''
In the video , the band members are all battered and bruised and the neck of John Frusciante 's guitar is broken .
Also , John is seen driving ; the irony being that he ca n't actually drive .
This spent a record 16 weeks at # 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart .
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England -RRB-
