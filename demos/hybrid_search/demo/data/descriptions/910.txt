This was the debut single released by English alternative rock band Morning Glory .
Frontman Steve Sparrow explained the song 's meaning to i-D Online : `` It 's about grabbing those close to you when they might be down and in need of a good time !
Living life -- going out and making the most of what 's around you . ''
Sparrow and bassist Phill Titus worked together as labourers before forming Morning in Parade in 2007 with guitarist Chad Thomas whom they met at college plus keyboardist Ben Giddings and drummer Andrew Hayes , whom they both knew from the local music scene .
The band 's name came from the days when Sparrow and Titus used to have to get up then travel in the early mornings to their various jobs .
They referred to this as doing the `` morning parade . ''
