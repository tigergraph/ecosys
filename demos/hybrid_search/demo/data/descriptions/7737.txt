Following electro-pop duo Goldfrapp 's departure from EMI , a fourteen-track career-spanning retrospective of their hits to date was released .
The compilation included two new tracks , this piece of dreamy synth-pop and the new wave ballad `` Melancholy Sky . ''
The song serves as a tribute to Alison Goldfrapp 's late mum .
She explained to Interview Magazine : `` The lyric for ` Yellow Halo ' came to me when I was thinking about my mother .
She died two summers ago , when I was on the Head First tour .
I see the ` Yellow Halo ' as a happy and positive force . ''
The song 's music video was shot on iPhone by Lisa Gunning in South America and chronicles the duo 's travels on the road .
Gunning is a film editor whose credits include Breaking and Entering and Nowhere Boy .
She also directed Goldfrapp 's 2010 single , `` Believer . ''
Alison Goldfrapp disclosed in a February 2010 interview with The Sunday Times that she was dating Gunning .
