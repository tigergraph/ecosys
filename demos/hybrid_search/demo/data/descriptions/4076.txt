This is the first song to appear from British dance-punk band Klaxons ' second album , Surfing The Void , the follow-up to their Mercury Prize-winning , Myths Of the Near Future .
BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe premiered this first new material from Klaxons in three years on his radio show on May 25 , 2010 .
This song is a homage to extra-terrestrial life .
Klaxons ' Jamie Reynolds explained to the NME June 5 , 2010 : `` It 's about the arrival of aliens .
There was a load of press last year saying that in May the Government was going to announce the aliens -LRB- had landed -RRB- .
I wanted to make the soundtrack to it .
The track only went online on May 25 , though , so we 've left it a bit late . ''
Surfing The Void was recorded in Los Angeles with Korn producer Ross Robinson , and was three years in the making due to the band ditching a lot of their original material .
In March 2009 it was reported that the band had been told by their record label to re-record parts of the album , after it was deemed it `` too experimental '' for release .
`` We were an art project that got out of hand , '' bassist Jamie Reynolds later said , `` but now we are a band . ''
