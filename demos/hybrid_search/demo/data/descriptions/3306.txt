This ode to jealousy in the face of `` the other man '' was penned by X Factor vocal coach Kotecha and Swedish songwriters Carl Falk and Rami Yacoub .
They are the same trio who also penned One Direction 's singles , `` What Makes You Beautiful '' and `` One Thing . ''
Falk told Examiner.com how the ballad came to be written : `` All of the songs that we do have kind of a signature guitar riff to them , '' he said .
`` It was the same thing with ' I Wish . '
We just started to play around with some chords , and the riff came up , and we found the melody.That was a bit of a trick to make the chorus really lift ... But it came more from singing and playing than ` mathematic songwriting . '
I played the guitar ; the other guys -LSB- Yacoub and Kotecha -RSB- just sang it .
And we came up with the song that way . ''
