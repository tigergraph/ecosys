Currington told AOL the story behind Bonnie Swayze , the co-writer of this song .
He explained : `` This song was sent to me by a friend of mine out in L.A. .
He was like , ` Man , I heard this song the other day , and I 'm sending it to you because I feel like it 's the type of song you really sing well .
I do n't know if you 'll have any interest in it or not , but I 'm sending it your way . '
I got it and listened to it and immediately loved the song .
I did n't think too much else about it , but when it came time to record , I went back over that song again and played it for everybody who was involved , and everybody hands-down agreed that it was a great song .
We did it , and the same day that I recorded it , I called up the guy who sent it to me and said ` Man , I need the writers on this song . '
And he was like ` Man , my mom wrote that song ! '
` Are you kidding me ? '
` Yeah , my mom Bonnie Swayze wrote this song ! '
She 'd never had a cut before , ever , but man , she wrote a great song .
She wrote the lyrics and Tony the melody , and it was the first thing she 'd ever done .
To me , that was special . ''
