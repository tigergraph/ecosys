This is the fourth single from The Defamation of Strickland Banks , a concept album by British rapper/singer Plan B about a British soul vocalist who finds fame before getting sent to jail for a crime that he did n't commit .
This song finds Banks stuck in his prison cell , feeling sorry for himself .
Ben Drew -LRB- aka Plan B -RRB- told the story of this song in an interview with Artist Direct : `` Well , you 've got this famous guy in prison who does n't belong there .
Because he 's famous , he 's a target for the queers , the murderers , and the rapists .
I asked if I was in that position , what would I do ?
There are people out there trying to attack me .
I 'm not a killer .
The first thing I 'd do is stay in my cell and not come out .
I 'd grow my beard , not wash , and stink to the point where any rapist would find me so disgusting he would n't come near me .
` The Recluse ' is about someone who 's not coming out of his cell , not washing , not looking after himself , and growing a beard so he becomes repellent to anyone who would want to cause him harm .
This character thinks that 's going to stop them but it does n't .
That 's why ` The Recluse ' leads into '' Traded In My Cigarettes ' where he makes the conscious decision to save up all his cigarettes and trade them for a shank to protect himself from all these people who want to do all this f -- ed up s -- t to him . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Daniel Wolfe and shows Banks -LRB- played by Plan B -RRB- during his time in prison , as well as flashbacks of his life before he was banged up .
Actress Vicky McClure , who is best known for her work in the films of Shane Meadows , plays Banks ' girlfriend .
