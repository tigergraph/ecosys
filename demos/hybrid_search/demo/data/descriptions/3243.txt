Dylan recorded this in New York City with a talented group of studio musicians including Al Kooper and Charlie Daniels .
Ron Cornelius , who played guitar on these sessions , told us that Dylan would play down the song , but as soon as they started recording he would play it in a completely different tempo , which threw off the musicians but forced them to play to their strengths .
These sessions lasted about 3 weeks , with the best songs going on this album and many of the others ending up on his 1973 self-titled album Dylan .
Artists to have covered this song include The Clash , Joe Cocker and Matumbi .
This played a major role in the Coen Brothers ' 1998 movie The Big Lebowski .
The song has since been performed live by the film 's main star , Jeff Bridges .
