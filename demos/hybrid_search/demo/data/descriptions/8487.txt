The message of this song : Do n't get caught up in your friends , family or enemies and do n't let them make decisions for you .
Do n't let acceptance get in the way of anything you want from life .
Be you , define yourself , do n't let anyone shape you into something you do n't want to be .
The singer is telling the girl to make her own decisions and that one day she will be happy .
