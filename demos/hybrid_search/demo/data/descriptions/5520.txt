In this song Voegele disavows peoples ' perception of her as an eternal good girl .
She explained in publicity materials : `` The whole idea that you have to be tortured to be an artist , it drove me nuts .
That frustration is what the song is about , where I say , maybe I did n't have a coke addiction or spend my nights getting hammered and dancing on tables , but I 'm not this untouchable perfect girl on a pedestal . ''
