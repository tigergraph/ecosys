Vocalist Chad Gray told Artist Direct that this cinematic number is his favorite song on Mudvayne .
He explained : `` I love the verses , and the chorus reminds me of one of my favorite songs from The End of All Things to Come -- ` Skrying . '
It just happened that way .
The misdirection between the verse and the chorus is awesome .
There 's not a lot of melody ; it 's just disturbing , fu -- ed up , weird and cool .
There are no big sing-y parts .
It 's just in-your-fu -- ing-face . ''
