Escala are a female electronic string quartet who were finalists on the 2008 Britain 's Got Talent series .
The tune first came to many peoples attention through its use in a series of adverts for the diamond company DeBeers .
Sky Sports also used the music for their 2008-09 football season promotional campaign .
Though Escala 's version was the first instance of this song charting in the UK , a number of other acts have recorded it including the Australian/British string quartet Bond and techno act Silent Nick .
This piece was written in 1996 by former Soft Machine multi-instrumentalist , turned classical composer , Karl Jenkins .
It is the first movement of the `` Palladio '' suite , which was inspired by the Italian architect Andrea Palladio -LRB- 1508-1580 -RRB- , who designed numerous palaces and country houses making use of Roman classical forms , symmetry , and proportion .
The Palladian architecture style was named after him .
The Escala album was produced by former Buggles and Yes member Trevor Horn .
