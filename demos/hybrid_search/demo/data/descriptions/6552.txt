Nashville songwriters John Scott Sherrill and Shawn Camp wrote this .
Says Sherrill : `` When we wrote it , it was almost a ballad - slow mid-tempo with a lilting little acoustic guitar lick that forms the basis of the song .
When Ronnie and Kix first heard it , they were n't so sure about it .
I think it was -LRB- producer -RRB- Don Cook who talked them into it .
He said , ' I think we can mop this thing up and turn it into a Brooks & Dunn kind of thing , ' and boy , they sure did .
I thought that was great what they did there . ''
The line , `` A month of Sundays '' is a southern expression Sherrill 's mother used to say .
It means a long time - 31 Sundays , that 's a long time .
-LRB- thanks to John Scott Sherrill for speaking with us about his songs -RRB- Many of the more personal songs Sherrill has written have become hits , including `` Nothin ' But The Wheel '' by Patty Loveless and `` Modern Day Drifter '' by Dierks Bentley .
This was not written from his personal experience .
Says Sherrill , `` That might of come from Shawn 's inner personal turmoil banks , but not mine .
I think he 's writing about somebody I do n't know . ''
