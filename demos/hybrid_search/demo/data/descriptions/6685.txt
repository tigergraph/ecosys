Guitarist Benji Madden explained this song 's meaning to Alternative Press : `` This song was a really important one for me .
The Good Charlotte fans know the story of my family from our past albums , but we 've never been able to tell them about our happier times .
This song is that story about my parents , Robin and Roger , who worked really hard to give us a great childhood . ''
A video was shot for the song in Tucson during Good Charlotte 's June 2011 tour with Yellowcard and Runner Runner .
`` This video captures the vibe of our band these days perfectly , '' Joel Madden told AOL Music . ''
The song 's title alludes to the date Benji and his identical twin brother Joel were born - March 11 , 1979 .
