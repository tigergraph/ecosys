This was one of several songs that Moore wrote for Outlaws Like Me with his producer Jeremy Stover and Country songwriter Rhett Akins -LRB- `` All About Tonight , '' `` The Shape I 'm In , '' `` Farmer 's Daughter '' -RRB- .
He told the story of the song to WSOC radio in Charlotte : `` I was working at a furniture store in probably 2006 or 2005 and someone told me I was too country .
I thought , ` What the heck does that mean ? '
I remember always thinking about that and then we started writing for this album and my co-writers loved this idea .
So this was really fun to write because we just kind of goofed off for 2 hours . ''
