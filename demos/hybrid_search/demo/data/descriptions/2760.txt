This is the title track from the ninth release by American singer-songwriter and musician Sufjan Stevens .
The album 's title -LRB- pronounced `` Age of Odds '' -RRB- is a reference to the apocalyptic art of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson -LRB- 1936-1997 -RRB- whose work depicted his vivid dreams and visions of space aliens , futuristic automobiles , eccentric monsters and signs of the Last Judgment .
Robertson 's work is used for the album cover , interior design , and as general inspiration for the tone of the album .
