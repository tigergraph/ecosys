On this song , Ross namechecks a number of artists , including 50 Cent , T.I. Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston .
The Miami rapper warned MTV News that the tune , `` is gon na cause a lot of problems . ''
He explained : `` It 's a scathing four-and-half-minute nonstop flow , me being autobiographical about my life and my come-up and my triumph .
Of course , I had to address a few things , I had to address a few people .
I love it .
The thing is , some people are gon na be gon na be f -- ed up .
That 's the best way I can put it . ''
The lyric `` I love to pay ya bills , ca n't wait to pay ya rent / Curtis Jackson baby mama , I ai n't looking for a cent / Burn the house down , '' refers to a suspicious fire in May 2008 at a home owned by 50 Cent .
The New York rapper 's ex-girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins was living there at the time and the house was at the center of a lawsuit between the couple .
When this track leaked onto the Internet in January 2009 , it sparked a feud between Ross and 50 .
