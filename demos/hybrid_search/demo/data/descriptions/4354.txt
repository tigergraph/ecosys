This is a track from The Sun Comes Out Tonight , the sixth album by American Industrial Rock band Filter .
Speaking with All Knowing Force , frontman Richard Patrick explained that the song has a similar lyrical content to one of their best known cuts .
`` We were talking about some of the things that are going on in my life , '' he said , `` there 's been a lot of betrayal from people surrounding me .
So we were thinking ` Hey Man Nice Shot ' , that 's something that describes a desperate man 's actions and trying to make sense of it , almost like a joke .
So we started talking about betrayal and we played around with the words ` Take That Knife Out of My Back ' and all of a sudden this song just wrote itself . ''
