This song was inspired by MC Chas Smith 's father 's repeated heart attacks .
It tells the story of a workholic who dies of a heart attack .
This was banned by BBC Radio 1 because of its lyrical content .
Such lines as `` gasping for the hot air , but the chest pain it wo n't go '' were deemed unsuitable for its national audience .
