The Raconteurs have been criticised in some quarters for being derivative of other bands .
The Sun newspaper May 8 , 2008 asked Jack White if he minded how his music is constantly compared with others .
The Raconteurs frontman replied : `` I think a lot of critics and listeners do n't realize that there are two types of songwriters .
Some listen to songs and rip them off and some write songs that end up sounding like someone else .
On ` These Stones Will Shout , ' there 's a a part in there where we go to the D , the C , when it goes electric , that you could imagine someone saying , ` That sounds like The Who ' .
But that does n't mean we 're gon na change it .
When you 're recording , you do n't hire some guy with a dictionary to stand by and say , ` Ah , ah , ah , that sounds like Devo .
Stop right now . '
I talked to Jimmy Page and I was saying that Led Zeppelin owned the riff .
Any band who writes a riff , any riff ever , it gets compared to Led Zeppelin , from Rage Against The Machine and on and on to The White Stripes .
It 's the same with The Beatles .
They own melodic .
The Beach Boys own vocal harmonies .
There 's these bands that did it first and they own it for all eternity . ''
The album title comes from an inscription on the south west corner of Washington DC 's main post office , which was composed by American writer and educator Charles William Eliot .
The full inscription reads : `` Messenger of sympathy and love , servant of parted friends , consoler of the lonely , bond of the scattered family , enlarge of the common life . ''
