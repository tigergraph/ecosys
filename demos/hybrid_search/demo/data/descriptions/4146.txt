Demon Hunter frontman Ryan Clark told Alternative Press why he utilizes clean rather than screaming vocals on this track : `` I wanted to do a couple songs on the record that were heavy , but had singing throughout the verses , '' he explained .
`` I think it 's cool to play within the blueprint we 've created - sometimes -LRB- in subtle ways -RRB- doing the opposite of what we 're used to doing .
Things like this also help keep the album interesting .
The intro vocal was something I heard in my head after we 'd finished recording the song .
I thought it might be cool to start the song with vocals , which is a pretty rare thing for us . ''
