Peyroux has generally recorded either covers or collaborated with other artists .
This song is a rarity : a sole Peyroux-penned composition .
She told Billboard magazine : `` I 'm really happy that I got to write .
It feels like a new segment , and it 's great work .
I 'm surrounded by beautiful sounds , really honest musicians , really honest playing . ''
Peyroux told The Associated Press : `` The song really reminds me a lot of my own life .
It does n't matter , somehow we always get through , we lose and then we continue . ''
This song is dedicated to the folk singer Odetta , who died in December 2008 .
Peyroux toured with her in 2006 .
The jazz singer told The Daily Telegraph April 9 , 2009 that the artist and civil rights activist `` changed everything '' for her . ''
She explained : `` I was lucky enough to meet her while I was recording a Bessie Smith song in 2004 .
I looked up and she was conducting me from the vocal booth , not just with her hands but with every emotion running across her face .
Without being less humble than I should be , I felt I had an understanding with her .
I felt we recognised that the blues are a part of our heritage , too .
That women are not only doing and experiencing the same things as men , but also that we can see what men are going through . ''
