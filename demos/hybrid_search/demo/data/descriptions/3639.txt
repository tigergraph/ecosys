The Dreamer/The Believer closes with a benediction given by Common 's own father , Lonnie `` Pops '' Lynn .
Despite divorcing the rapper 's mother when Common was six-years-old , former ABA basketball player turned youth counselor Lynn remained active in his son 's life .
Lynn has performed his spoken word poetry on several of Common 's albums and contributed lyrics to many other of his son 's tracks .
His hippie ideals and nuggets of wisdom have gathered him his own following in the rap world .
