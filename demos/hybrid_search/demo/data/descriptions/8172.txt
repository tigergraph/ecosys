During a radio interview in 2006 , lead singer Buddy Nielsen explained that he `` just wanted to tell a story . ''
The song is just that : A murder mystery .
Buddy stated during the interview that he loves crime shows such as Law and Order and CSI , and that he wanted to write a song like that .
Thus , `` Buried a Lie '' was born .
