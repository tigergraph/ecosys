The strangest story every toldWas how I got to be this oldLoudon Wainwright III tells us the strange story of his life in `` The Here & The Now '' from the album Older Than My Old Man .
Like pages flipped in a family album , we see the singer being born and growing through the decades .
Women come and go , his children are born , but all the while he ca n't understand what his purpose is in the `` here and now .
`` I do n't know why I 'm not sure howI wind up here to the here and nowBy the 21st century , he finds the answer staring him right in the face ... or in the pants.My seed 's been spent and my loins are cold .
`` I suppose it could be argued that I 'm here to procreate .
And now that my procreating days are pretty much over , there 's no point in being here anymore , if you want to take a hard line on that , '' said Loudon to the A.V. Club .
All four of Wainwright 's children - Rufus , Martha , Lucy and Alexandra -LRB- `` Lexie '' -RRB- - are featured on the song , along with ex-lover Suzzy Roche and current wife Ritamarie Kelly .
