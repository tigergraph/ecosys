This song has a theme of unity , and trust and the chorus lyrics are from an old Scandinavian proverb : `` The secrets in the snow , will always come out in the thaw . ''
Vocalist and lyricist Simon Neil told Kerrang !
: `` It 's about people trying to hide who they are from you , for no apparent reason , and you 're trying to scrape through to see the truth underneath it all , '' he said .
`` It 's about how secrets , lies , fibs and pulling the wool over someone else 's eyes will never work . ''
