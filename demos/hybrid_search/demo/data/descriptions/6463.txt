This song was originally on Melonie Cannon 's 2004 debut self-titled album .
Cannon is the daughter of Buddy Cannon , who has produced albums and written songs for Reba McEntire and other Country artists .
McEntire explained to Great American Country why she decided to cover it : `` When I was working with Buddy Cannon years ago , he gave it to me .
I love Melonie 's voice .
` Nothing to Lose ' was one of those songs that I said , ` Man , if I could ever record that ?
, ' so I did .
I told everybody , ' I want to feature the band on this , ' so we let the band play two or three times .
Everybody had an instrumental .
It 's about a woman leaving on the bus going down to Georgia .
She does n't know where she 's going and does n't know what lies ahead , but she does n't care .
It 's another strong woman song . ''
Trisha Yearwood also recorded this on her 2007 Greatest Hits album .
