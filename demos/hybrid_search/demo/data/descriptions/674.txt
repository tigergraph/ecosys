This was inspired by the novel Lord Of The Flies by William Golding , which was made into two movies : one in 1963 and one in 1990 -LRB- neither were great critical successes -RRB- .
It 's about a group of boys who are shipwrecked and begin embracing their primal side .
-LRB- thanks , Brett - Edmonton , Canada -RRB- This is the most guitar-driven song on the album .
The two songs on the B-side were a cover of the Who 's `` My Generation '' and a cover of UFO 's `` Doctor , Doctor . ''
-LRB- thanks , Brett - Edmonton , Canada , for above 3 -RRB- Lord Of The Flies is the literal translation of the Greek word Beezelbub .
In the Bible , Beezelbub is the name given for Satan by Jesus -LRB- this occurs in the episode where he casts demons out of a crazy man and into a pig .
There 's also a line in there from which Lincoln derived his phrase about the Civil War - a house divided upon itself can not stand -RRB- .
While most songs dealing with Golding 's novel deal with the more good guy characters in the novel - Ralph and Piggy , or with the kinda psychic kid -LRB- Simon -RRB- who actually talks to the beast , this song is unique in that it 's told from the point of view of the most savage boys - Jack and his crew .
It 's kind of like The Rolling Stones ' Sympathy For The Devil in that it 's a sort of exoneration for evil behavior , and cautions that everyone is called to be evil .
-LRB- thanks , Jackie - Dallas , TX -RRB- The artwork on the single depicted Iron Maiden 's mascot Eddie as literally a lord of the flies .
He sits , dressed as a monarch , on an electric chair -LRB- serving as a throne -RRB- with a swarm of flies around him .
