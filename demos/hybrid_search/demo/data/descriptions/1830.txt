This dance floor primed tune bemoans the deification of President Ronald Reagan .
Guitarist/keyboardist Anand Wilder commented to Complex magazine : `` I do n't think the political message in this song is that hidden .
It 's kind of like a zombie , skeleton party . ''
Wilder told Complex magazine that he considers this to be one of the band 's more radio friendly songs .
`` It 's kind of a straight up , four to the floor disco beat , with a little bit of a stilted backbeat in there , '' he said .
`` We recorded this after our initial recording sessions in the fall with this guy who had all this analog synth gear we could hook up to , to get that warmth , grit , edge that you ca n't get out of digital . ''
