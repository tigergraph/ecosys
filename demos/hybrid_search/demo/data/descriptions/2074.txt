Vocalist Tim Armstrong -LRB- from the band 's MySpace site -RRB- : `` I 've been going through these cities for years and know them well .
I know what they look like and sound like ; it 's like a movie I 've seen twenty times .
The last time we toured through the Rust Belt the downtowns looked gutted and they did n't feel the same .
That feeling is what inspired this song . ''
Bassist Matt Freeman added : `` It 's about the dying industrial regions of this great country and with it the dying of the middle class .
Speculators and bankers that came into these cities and closed factories and sold them off overseas or just let them die .
Putting nothing in its place and moving on like some mythical destructive monster .
To me this song has a real Who vibe mixed with classic Rancid hardcore that could have been on Let 's Go . ''
