This is the first official single from American rapper and Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon 's fourth solo album , Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II .
Raekwon commented to MTV News on the song , `` It 's classic Wu . ''
He added : `` This album is basically a flashback of where we came from .
Everybody knows us from the karate skits , the different formats of how we set up our men and we do a RZA/Wu track sounding joint .
It 's this kind of record .
I think that this is what everybody wanted from the Clan .
RZA did n't even make the beat - J Dilla made the beat .
This one is interesting for hip-hop .
I feel this was carved out for dudes to definitely slam . ''
The song features Wu constituents Method Man , Inspectah Deck , Ghostface Killah , and GZA .
Raekwon has likened this track to `` Triumph '' from Wu-Tang 's 1997 second album Wu Tang Forever .
