This song is about being too weak , and too much of a push-over to stand up for yourself .
It is also about the band being part of the upper classes after Dookie 's release , and how Billie Joe Armstrong did n't quite fit in .
-LRB- thanks , Ryan - Bethany , OK -RRB- This only received its title after a studio mix up .
The band had intended `` Do Da Da , '' which originally was going to be on Insomniac , to be named `` Stuck With Me . ''
However this song accidentally ended up being christened `` Stuck With Me , '' and the band retained the title as they felt it suited this one better .
