This is the first single from the Country music artist Randy Houser 's third album .
The song was written by Houser together with Nashville singer-songwriters Shane Minor and David Lee Murphy and is about the importance of being patient and accepting God 's will .
Houser debuted the song for a live audience on January 27 , 2011 in celebration of his ACM Nomination for New Solo Vocalist of the Year during GAC 's ACM Showcase televised special .
Houser told The Boot about the inspiration for the tune : `` I was in a place where all the things I thought would make me truly happy , I found could make me just as miserable .
`` He added : `` This song had been on my heart for about three weeks .
We wrote another song , and everyone was packing up to leave and I sat down and played the first chord and sang ` In God 's Time . '
I said , ` Shane , I 'm supposed to write this song .
Do y' all want to stay ? '
Both of them said -LSB- yes -RSB- .
It was exactly what I needed to say at the time , '' he continued .
`` It was exactly what I 'd been feeling , but it had n't manifested itself yet .
It was exactly what my heart needed to hear .
A lot of times you have to verbally say things to soak 'em up . ''
