This song is about the 1981 Penlee lifeboat disaster in which 16 people lost their lives while attempting a sea rescue in hurricane-force conditions off the south Cornish coast .
Amongst those who died was the father of a couple of Lakeman 's friends while his own father Geoff , a Daily Mirror reporter , covered the story .
Seth Lakeman , who was 6 when the tragedy happened , told the Daily Telegraph July 3 , 2008 about it : `` I remember it very well .
The whole of the West Country was in shock .
It 's not something you forget .
And , when I was 19 , my best friend and his mate died surfing at Polzeath .
There was no lifeboat there .
I was in a band - Equation - and we did a couple of concerts to raise money to help build a lifeboat station there .
Those lifeboat guys ... they 're heroes .
I just wanted to honor them . ''
