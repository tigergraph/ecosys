The song is set around the time frontman Guy Garvey was kicked out of home for giving up on college , when the Catholic-raised singer had lost his faith in God .
He explained to Q magazine : `` I 'm talking to myself at 20 with the benefit of hindsight .
Having seen my friends coping with how difficult it is to have kids , the one thing you never say to your kids is , Am I a good enough dad ?
Because they 're supposed to take it for granted you are .
But it 's scary as f -- k. ''
