This Barack Obama shout out features Nas .
In this song the rapper proclaims his support for Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign .
He told MTV News : `` I motivate the thugs .
I 'm really proud of Barack Obama .
It 's crazy 'cause for the first time , we got hope .
A lot of times you be out here and do what you do .
You see the presidents come in and go out .
They really do n't help the people , they help themselves and their partners . ''
The song 's video was inspired by the one Public Enemy ' did for `` Fight the Power , '' in which the whole community comes out for a common cause .
Jeezy explained to MTV News : `` I did -LSB- the video -RSB- with the ` Fight the Power ' concept because I remember , back in the day , Flavor Flav and Chuck D marching down the street .
They had the old people , the young people , store owners , they had picket signs , everything .
It was a sense of black pride , a sense of pride , period . ''
Besides Nas , Bow Wow , Bun B , DJ Greg Street and Jeezy 's artist Roccett have cameos in the clip .
Jeezy told Rolling Stone magazine about the lyric `` My president is black/My Lambo 's blue/I 'll be goddamned if my rims ai n't too . ''
He explained that Obama becoming president would be as surprising as him rolling into the housing projects in his blue Lamborghini .
The MC added : `` When I pulled up in my car , that s -- t was unbelievable to people in my neighborhood because they were like , ` We grew up with him .
How the hell did he accomplish this ? '
I feel like it was the same way with Obama .
I grew up all this time , but I 've never seen a black man this close to running this country . ''
