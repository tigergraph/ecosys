This is the opening track from English alternative pop singer-songwriter Richard Hawley 's sixth album , Truelove Gutter .
Hawley told the Newcastle Evening Chronicle that he wanted to create the sound dropping a microphone in a car engine might create at the start of this track , but he did n't know how to do it .
He discussed the problem with David Coulter , who plays the musical saw on the album .
Hawley continued , `` I explained this sound to him , the car engine thing .
He went in his bag and pulled out a CD .
It was him and Thomas Bloch playing an instrument called the Cristal Baschet .
It was exactly the sound I 'd been hearing .
I could have kissed him . ''
The song opens with the celestial wailing of the glass harmonica , the water phone and the Cristal Baschet .
The glass harmonica is an instrument based on the haunting tone you get when rubbing a wet finger around the rim of a wine glass .
It was rationalised into its mechanical form by Benjamin Franklin in 1761 and was inspired by his love of water .
On Truelove Gutter it is played by French classical musician Thomas Bloch , who has worked with Radiohead and Vanessa Paradis .
