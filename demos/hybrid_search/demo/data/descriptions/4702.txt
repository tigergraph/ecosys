This track finds Julian Casablancas drawling about leaving a relationship as his lover wants to settle down and just be a normal family .
He looks back to the days where he could sleep until noon , but now has to get up early to fulfill his duties .
`` While she 's asleep .
It is n't right , '' he adds , `` But it is n't hard . ''
Guitarist Albert Hammond , Jr. commented to NME regarding the song : `` To me it feels sad , but it feels good that it 's sad .
I imagine we sound different from the first record .
It 's a different time in life . ''
A number of reviewers compared the song 's busy synth line to that of a-ha 's '80s chart-topper `` Take On Me . ''
