This was inspired by Burl Ives ' portrayal of Big Daddy in the movie version of Tennessee Williams ' Cat On A Hot Tin Roof .
Mellencamp said in the liner notes for the On The Rural Route 7609 box set : `` This song was more or less a postcard to myself , saying , ` You think Burl Ives was n't so nice ?
Guess what , John . ' ''
