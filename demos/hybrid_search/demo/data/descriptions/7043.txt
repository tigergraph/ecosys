Pistol Annie Angaleena Presley penned this song , which includes references to squirrel gravy and coon stew , about her coon-hunting uncle .
She told The Boot that she 's eaten squirrel gravy on many occasions .
`` Squirrel gravy is more where I 'm from in the mountains , '' she said .
`` We had squirrel gravy growing up every Easter .
That would be the main dish because all the men would bring all the squirrels that they had killed , and we 'd make a big batch of squirrel gravy with cornbread .
You just dip cornbread in it .
It 's kind of like chicken and dumplings , that texture , creamy and liquid-y . ''
