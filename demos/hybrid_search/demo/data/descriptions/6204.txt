This up-tempo tune is the lead single from American Christian piano-pop singer Francesca Battistelli 's sophomore album , Hundred More Years .
Written by Battistelli , along with Ian Eskelin and Tony Wood , the song expresses the frustrations of everyday life that often drive us crazy , but in the end teach us patience and thankfulness .
In our interview with Francesca , she said : `` I came up with like 20 different frustrating things , and we just picked our favorites .
The idea of me losing my keys and my phone is very true to my life .
I 'm constantly having my husband call my phone because I ca n't find it , and then it happens to be in my purse or in my pocket - it 's a very true line . ''
Here 's a bit more info about the singer 's co-writers : Tony Wood has penned numerous 21st century CCM hits and won a Dove Award in the category of Inspirational Song of the Year for his contribution to Mark Harris 's single `` Find Your Wings . ''
Ian Eskelin is a record producer , song writer , and founding member and lead singer of the Grammy-nominated Christian rock band All Star United .
He won the Dove Award for `` Producer of the Year '' in 2008 .
Wood and Eskelin previously co-wrote Battistelli 's debut single , `` I 'm Letting Go '' and the title track of her first album .
It was producer Ian Eskelin 's idea to use a ukulele on this track , which Mike Payne played on the record .
Performing the song live , Battistelli plays the ukulele with two of her band members , forming a ukulele trio .
She told us : `` The song kind of took a different direction when we introduced the ukulele , but we love how it turned out , and it 's such a fun song . ''
