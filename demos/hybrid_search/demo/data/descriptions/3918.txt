Frontwoman Emily Haines told Drowned in Sound that this song was written , `` at a farmhouse studio called Bear Creek , just outside Seattle . ''
She added : `` They have an amazing selection of vintage instruments there and I love the way the Wurlitzer makes this song sound like something from a 1970 's detective show . ''
