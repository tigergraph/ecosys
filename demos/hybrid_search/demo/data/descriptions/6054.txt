Will Jennings , who worked with Winwood on songs from his albums Arc Of A Diver , Talking Back To The Night and Back In The High Life , wrote the lyrics .
He told us : `` Valerie is a real person , whose identity I will not reveal .
She was almost at the top of the world in her profession and let it slip away from her .
She was a dear friend and this was my tribute to her . ''
