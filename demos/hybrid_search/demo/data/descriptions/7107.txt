Co-singer/guitarist Ed Droste told Drowned in Sound : `` This is perhaps the most collaborative song on the album .
Started as a piano demo , then became full band , then Dan -LRB- Rossen-co singer/guitarist -RRB- added an intro and chorus , then we turned the final phrasing of ' I ca n't get out of what I 'm into with you ' on it 's head and had it be a bit more uplifting instead of the original sadness that the song carried . ''
Rossen added : `` Bear -LRB- drummer Chris Bear -RRB- had originally done this song on piano with Ed , and it was very sombre and beautiful with a completely different set of darker chords .
I , for some reason , decided to flip it around , do it on guitar and make the whole chord progression much happier , removing most of the minor chords .
I still really love the original though . ''
