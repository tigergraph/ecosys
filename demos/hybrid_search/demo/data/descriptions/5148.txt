TFK frontman/songwriter Trevor McNevan had the idea for this song for some time .
He told NewReleaseTuesday : `` Although it 's in the same vein as some of our other high-octane songs , like ` Fire It Up , ' it 's quite different .
I wanted it to have that U2 Vertigo type vibe ; that big stadium energy with single notes on the main guitar riff , instead of chords . ''
This was a challenge for McNevan to sing as its one of the highest songs vocally he 's written to date .
He told NewReleaseTuesday : `` With every record , you try to push yourself .
When your writing it 's no big deal , but when you get tracking , you realize , ` wow , I 'm gon na really have to step into this ! '
And this was the first song written for the new album that had actual rhyming in it .
I grew up on old school hip hop and have always been into rhyming .
That 's where I came from , and I think it has given me a lot of unique advantages as a vocalist and as a writer .
It also has its setbacks .
You have to remember that not everybody is listening for a clever or witty lyric or vocal pattern , and it can easily throw them off or sometimes just go right over their heads .
I hate predictable rhymes .
This song is like an explosive ; it builds and then explodes , comes right back down , builds , and then explodes again .
Musical pyro !!! I wanted the listener to feel the energy , and feel the emotion behind it .
It 's a call to action . ''
