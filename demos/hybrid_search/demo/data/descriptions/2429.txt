On The Hazards of Love , different guest vocalists voice the individual characters in the song 's storyline .
On this song My Brightest Diamond 's Shara Worden voices the jealous queen of a spooky forest who threatens the love between the tragic heroine Margaret and the shape-shifting forest dweller William .
The A.V.Club asked Colin Meloy if he wrote the songs for the females who guested on The Hazards of Love in their voice ranges .
He replied : `` Well , I did n't know their ranges well enough , and having never written for women before , it was all really guesswork , just assuming they were gon na have a far superior range than mine . ''
He added : `` Once I heard Shara sing , I was really intent on having them sing those songs , so I started writing out of my range , which was sort of a weird experience .
And thankfully they were both willing and able to do the songs afterward .
I do n't know what we would 've done otherwise , because I could n't sing the songs ''
