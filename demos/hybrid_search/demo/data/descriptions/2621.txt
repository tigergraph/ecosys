As I Lay Dying lead singer Tim Lambesis told us the meaning behind this song : `` Sometimes as a friend we need to go beyond being comfortable and confront our friends when they need us .
Our comfort can lead us to betray those we claim to love .
Specifically , ` Comfort Betrays ' is about the friendship I had with our previous bass player . ''
Lambesis explains the songwriting process for the band : `` The music and lyrics for As I Lay Dying are written very differently .
The music can be very collectively written at times , but the lyrics are just me writing about the issue and experiences that are most heavily on my mind .
In that sense , songwriting is very therapeutic in a way .
Instrumentally , every member of the band has their own preference .
Jordan is probably the biggest advocate of everyone getting together and jamming , while I prefer to just record the guitar parts and drums for the ideas I have and then send the other guys in the band a mp3 of it . ''
