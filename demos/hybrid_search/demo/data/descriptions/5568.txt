This song is the one original composition on the I Dreamed a Dream album .
The song features the gospel group The LJ Singers led by Lawrence Johnson on the final verse .
Boyle said of this song : `` Ambition , fate , call it what you will , but who was I born to be ?
Mum must have picked this for me . ''
This piano ballad was written by Oklahoma singer/songwriter Audra Mae .
Until she got this song placed on I Dreamed a Dream , her biggest claim to fame was being the grandniece of famed Hollywood icon Judy Garland .
For this track she hooked up with Swedish production/songwriter trio Play Production who sent her the chords and melody for a song they said was intended for Boyle 's album .
She told MTV News how she achieved her big break : `` I knew it needed to be a song that made sense for her to sing , so I went online and researched her and her life and found out how she got to be where she is , and it came from that .
I knew it needed to be something that she could be proud to sing .
Almost like a mantra - and I 'm thrilled that she liked it enough to put it on the album .
The cool thing is that she symbolizes real talent above anything else , above a show with pyrotechnics , a hot body ... she 's f -- ing talented and it 's really awesome to be a part of that . ''
