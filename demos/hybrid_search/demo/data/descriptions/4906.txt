Bob Seger is Hall of Fame singer and songwriter with tremendous appeal , but it took some help from Hollywood to earn him an elusive # 1 hit .
This song was written for the movie Beverly Hills Cop II , starring Eddie Murphy in his role as Axel Foley .
The first Beverly Hills Cop had a # 1 soundtrack that boosted the popular fortunes of The Pointer Sisters -LRB- `` Neutron Dance '' -RRB- and Patti LaBelle -LRB- `` New Attitude '' -RRB- .
For the sequel , it was Seger 's turn .
Harold Faltermeyer , who wrote the score for the film , wrote the music for `` Shakedown '' along with Keith Forsey .
Bob Seger wrote the lyrics , which relate to Murphy 's character .
Glenn Frey , who had a # 2 hit -LRB- # 12 in the UK -RRB- with `` The Heat Is On '' from the original Beverly Hills Cop , was slated record this song , which had different lyrics at the time .
However , a week before it was to be recorded , he had to drop out with laryngitis , so Bob Seger was asked to replace him .
However , Bob Seger did n't like the lyrics , and though he retained the same chorus , he rewrote the verses - which also gave him composer credit on the song .
Seger recalls , `` There were a lot of lyrics about working undercover , I did n't like them , so I threw them all out .
I decided to write it my way and they trusted my judgment . ''
This was nominated for an Oscar , for Best Music , Original Song , but lost out to Carly Simon 's `` Let The River Run '' from Working Girl .
When Seger released his first Greatest Hits album in 1994 , he left this song off .
Even though it 's his biggest hit , Seger felt it was n't his greatest , and not one of his signature songs .
