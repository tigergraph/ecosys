This was written and produced by Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers , who were leaders of the Disco band Chic .
Sister Sledge had been at the record label for 4 years without a hit .
They were thinking about leaving when Edwards and Rodgers took them on and produced their first album .
Edwards and Rodgers had proven themselves with their group Chic and were given the opportunity to produce any band on the label .
They chose Sister Sledge because they were young and willing to go along with whatever they came up with .
The album was recorded at the same time as Chic 's second album .
The same musicians played on both .
Will Smith sampled this in 1998 on his hit `` Gettin ' Jiggy Wit It . ''
This was the first big hit for Sister Sledge , a band made up of 4 sisters with the last name Sledge .
`` Mama Never Told Me '' got to # 20 in the UK in 1975 ; `` Love Do n't You Go Through No Changes On Me '' hit # 92 US the same year .
Chic was originally supposed to record this , but when the record company did n't like `` We Are Family , '' which Edwards and Rodgers first recorded with Sister Sledge , they had them record this instead of Chic .
`` We Are Family '' was released as their second single and became their biggest hit .
Luther Vandross sang backup on this .
He was a young singer at the record label still looking for his first hit .
