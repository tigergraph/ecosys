`` At a certain point in your life you realize that you 're going to die , and that 's a really important moment , '' he explained to The Independent : `` And then eventually you come to the conclusion that you 're gon na live and you 're gon na get older if you 're lucky , and you 're gon na go for life .
And when you 're doing so , it 's better to love people like it 's a choice , like it 's a privilege . ''
