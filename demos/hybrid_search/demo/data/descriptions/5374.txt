Though sonically this is quieter and subtler than most of the other tracks on A Flash Flood Of Colour , lyrically it definitely is not .
The song finds Rou Reynolds raging against war profiteering and all things military and he explained to Kerrang !
: `` It 's an anti-war song .
Human beings have been fighting since time began , and people therefore think it 's natural .
But war is a symptom of culture .
It 's about community and working out a global system that means we do n't need acts of barbarity to sort things out . ''
