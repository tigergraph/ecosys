Several Dog Man Star tracks were inspired by frontman Brett Anderson 's then girlfriend , 17-year-old Anick , including this , the album 's nine-minute centerpiece .
The song 's lyric referenced his teenage beau 's female lover .
`` I was n't interested in monogamy at that point , '' he told Mojo .
`` Sexual jealousy can be a stimulant too . ''
Anderson recorded his vocal the night after Butler gave an interview to Vox magazine in which he raged , `` I 'm desperate to do things outside of Suede .
Brett 's so f -- ing slow , it 's driving me insane . ''
`` I took all of the pain I was feeling and channeled it into my delivery , '' the singer told Vox .
`` Bernard later apologized , but it was n't nice . ''
Bernard Butler 's initial creation was a 25-minute piece with an eight-minute guitar solo .
The guitarist maintains he always intended to whittle it down , but producer Ed Buller remembers otherwise .
`` I told him the guitar solo was too long .
` No it 's not , Let 's just try . '
It took over three weeks to get it the right length , '' he recalled to Mojo .
