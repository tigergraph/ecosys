Tim McGraw linked up with his then girlfriend -LRB- now wife -RRB- Faith Hill for this hit single .
The song spent six weeks on top of Billboard 's Hot Country Songs chart and was both McGraw 's and Hill 's first top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 .
The Sherman Halsey-directed music video showcased a very pregnant Hill , who soon afterwards gave birth to the couple 's first child , Gracie .
The visual won Video of the Year at the 1997 Academy of Country Music Awards .
It also won Single of the Year , Song of the Year and Vocal Event of the Year at the same ceremony .
The song was penned by Stephony Smith and pitched to McGraw by Missy Gallimore , a successful song finder and wife of Tim 's producer Byron Gallimore .
McGraw told American Songwriter magazine that as soon as he heard the tune , he knew instantly he wanted to record it with Hill .
`` We were dating at the time , '' he explained , `` and we were in the middle of a tour together .
I remember I had a place out in Leiper 's Fork -LSB- a rural community outside of Nashville -RSB- and the bus was sitting there .
Missy showed up with that song and we went to the back of the bus to listen .
I instantly knew I was going to cut it .
I played it for Faith and told her I wanted her to sing on it .
We both really felt like we had something . ''
Artists who have covered the song include German singer Gil Ofarim , S Club 7 member Jo O'Meara , French pop vocalist Cherie and pop trio She Moves , whose version peaked at # 67 on the Hot 100 .
