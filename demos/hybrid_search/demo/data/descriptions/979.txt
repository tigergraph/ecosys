On this minor key piano lamenting change and modernization , frontman Win Butler revisits the town where he grow up .
`` I took a drive into the sprawl to find the house where we used to stay in , '' he recalls .
However , Butler fails to locate various childhood haunts that are imprinted on his memory .
Arcade Fire 's brothers Win and William Butler spent their formative years in The Woodlands , a suburb of Houston , Texas .
In preparing to write The Suburbs , Win and his wife and band colleague Chassagne travelled to The Woodlands in the summer of 2008 .
`` It was kind of a bummer , '' Chassagne told Q magazine April 2012 .
`` It was interesting to see that the people make the places , and when the people are gone , the places are still there but they 're not yours .
`` Driving around The Woodlands at night , the couple were pulled over by the local police for , `` suspicious activity . ''
The incident is detailed on this track .
`` It was a really strange experience , even before the cop incident , '' Butler told Q. `` My parents moved away seven years ago .
I no longer knew anyone there .
I was like being a tourist , a strange mix of knowing exactly where I was and also feeling completely alien ... A lot of the songs on The Suburbs are very much myself now looking back at that time , but also trying to put the pieces together , to reconnect with those feelings and those emotions before they 're gone completely . ''
