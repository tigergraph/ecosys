This was released as the second single from the English Metalcore band Asking Alexandria 's From Death to Destiny album .
Lead guitarist Ben Bruce told Loudwire that both this song and the previous single , `` Run Free , '' have very uplifting messages behind them .
`` No matter how bad things get , there 's always a light at the end of the tunnel , '' he said .
`` We went through that dark period and came out the other side .
It 's not to say there are n't any dark songs on the new album , there are , because we still do struggle with demons from time to time .
But on the whole it 's much more positive .
We see things in a different light now , and that was definitely portrayed on the new record . ''
Asking Alexandria released two different versions of this song : a `` pop mix '' and a metal one .
Ben Bruce explained to I Heart Guitar Blog : `` From all the people I 've spoken to so far they 've all said this is without a doubt our heaviest album .
Albeit we 've cut down on the breakdowns and we 've focused more on riffs and leads , but it 's still very , very heavy .
And we 've always wanted it to be heavy but accessible to other people who may not necessarily have picked up one of our albums before , or any heavy album , for that matter .
So the idea was to get these songs on the radio because we wanted to show people that , f -- k , heavy music is still alive and well , and it can be on the radio and it can be heard by more than just people in their bedroom . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Frankie Nasso -LRB- Escape The Fate , Mudvayne -RRB- and was written and produced by the director with Ash Avildsen .
The clip features a child version of singer Danny Worsnop discovering his rock 'n' roll destiny as hot women in vending machines try to communicate with the impressionable young boy .
