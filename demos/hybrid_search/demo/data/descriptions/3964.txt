This is a rare self-penned Westlife track , co-written by band member Mark Feehily .
All Saints star Shaznay Lewis was also roped in to help with the writing .
Kian Egan of Westlife commented to The Irish Times : `` We went through a phase in the early part of our career where we did want to write our own songs and we did , but they were crap in comparison with all the other great songs that we had .
If we wanted to write the album ourselves , we could , but we know we 're not naturally gifted songwriters .
We know our strength is in singing the songs and performing them on stage . ''
