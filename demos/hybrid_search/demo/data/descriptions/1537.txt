This album closer finds frontman Bart Millard singing about how we can love well all we want , but if we do so without Jesus , it does n't really mean anything .
He explained to NewReleaseTuesday : It 's one thing to pay it forward or to be kind and treat people better , which society will say is good enough , but man , if you 're not sharing the Gospel with them , which we believe is the absolute answer to everything , then it 's almost offensive.People should be one day saying , ` Why did n't you tell me everything and not just get the door for me or tip me as a waitress or whatever ?
Why did you not tell me this ? '
The Bible talks about that .
When you 've done it to the least of these , you 've done it to me and they 're going Lord , when were you sick ?
When were you hungry ?
I think that you ca n't fall short on this .
If that 's what we truly believe is that the absolute answer is Christ , then that should be one of the first things that 's coming out . ''
