Andy Grammer perfected his songwriting skills busking on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica , California , which is one of the more pleasant places to be a street musician .
This was one of the songs he used to play on the street and he told AOL Music it was the first one he penned that enabled him to hold a live crowd and convince them to buy his CD .
He explained : `` People walking by would look back and say , ` Oh yeah , you 're trying .
You keep at it !
Here 's a quarter . '
Then I would play that one at the end of my set and they 'd be like , ` You know what ?
Here 's 10 bucks , I 'm buying the album . '
So , that one 's a special one to me .
That was the turning point of the audience giving to me by listening , to me giving to them . ''
