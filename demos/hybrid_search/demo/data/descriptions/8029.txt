This is a Yiddish folk song written by the songwriters Aaron Zeitlin , Sholom Secunda , Arthur Kevess and Teddi Schwartz in 1940 .
It is also known as `` Dona Dona '' but it is not about a girl , but a calf on the way to market about to be slaughtered .
Some see this as a metaphor for Jews in the Holocaust .
This song was made popular by Joan Baez , who sang it on her debut album in 1960 .
Donovan also recorded this song on his debut album in 1965 .
