Monroe wrote this dark and haunting song of helpless desire with Little Big Town 's Karen Fairchild .
`` It 's about an addiction to something , '' the Pistol Annie explained , `` one thing or another , whether you 're stuck in a bad relationship or alcohol or whatever it , and you try to hide it and fight it but you 're kind of saying , ` Alright , you got me . ' ''
Little Big Town provides harmony vocals and the song also features a string section .
`` I felt the strings brought out the pain and the haunting feeling of the melody , '' Monroe told Billboard magazine .
`` When Little Big Town comes in , it 's like a choir of angels .
It breaks your heart -- in a good way . ''
The song originated during Monroe 's slumbers .
`` I was going through some personal stuff where I felt that something had me , and that melody came to me in my sleep , '' she explained to Billboard magazine .
`` Karen Fairchild , from Little Big Town , was coming over the next day to write , and I had recorded the melody into my phone as soon as I woke up .
We wrote it pretty quick .
It could be about any kind of addiction , drugs , alcohol , a bad relationship , grief , anything that has you .
I wanted to capture that feeling of hiding something that is not good for you . ''
