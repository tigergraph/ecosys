Singer Joe Jonas explained to the Australian radio program The Hot Hits : `` The idea stems from the course that racecar drivers take out on the track , always turning left and here if you take that one chance to go against the grain you find yourself in the arms of safety .
It 's a song about taking a chance , doing what you are not necessarily comfortable with and discovering solace in the unknown .
And most importantly , trusting those who mean a lot to you . ''
