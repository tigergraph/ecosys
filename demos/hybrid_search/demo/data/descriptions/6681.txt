Michael Stipe wrote the lyrics to this song in response to `` Eat For Two '' by 10,000 Maniacs - both songs are about pregnancy .
In the late '80s , R.E.M. toured with 10,000 Maniacs , and both groups were very popular on the College Rock scene .
Stipe and Maniacs lead singer Natalie Merchant shared many of the same qualities , including shyness , awkward dance moves and a quirky charisma , and they became friends , then lovers , then friends again .
Stipe credits Merchant with helping to inspire his songwriting , saying , `` The work she was doing was real and important - all about the human condition . ''
Kate Pierson contributes the female vocals to this song .
In the album booklet it is acknowledged as a duet , instead of Kate being a background singer .
She also sang on the Out Of Time track `` Shiny Happy People . ''
-LRB- thanks , Connor - Carlsbad , CA -RRB- Stipe says that he considers this an `` answer song '' to `` Eat for Two . ''
He explained in the book It Crawled From The South by Marcus Gray : `` It 's a male perspective on pregnancy , which I do n't think has been dealt with .
There 's a real push-me-pull-me issue , saying , ' I had nothing to do with it , ' yet on the other hand saying , ` Wait , I have feelings about this . ' ''
