Frontman Craig Nicholls told jmag -LRB- July 2008 -RRB- that this acoustic number started as two separate songs that were just meant to be together .
He explained : `` Both songs were in the same 6/8 rhythm , with the same pattern of strumming .
It fit together and we put strings on it .
Some string players came down when we were in America and it was a really spiritual thing .
It 's really sparse and totally pulled back , a contrast to ` Jamola ' !
The song is really personal .
Like everything on the album the songs have got a reality to them . ''
