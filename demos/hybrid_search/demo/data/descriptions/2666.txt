Owl City 's Adam Young penned this song for the soundtrack of the Disney movie , Wreck-It Ralph , which tells the story of an arcade game villain who decides to be a good guy .
`` As a huge fan of Disney animation films growing up , it was a real honor to write ` When Can I See You Again ' for , Wreck-It Ralph , '' said Young .
`` I felt like it was really challenging to try to live up to the Disney legacy .
I had a blast . ''
The song 's music video takes us inside of a video game .
`` The funnest thing has been actually standing in front of the arcade game with controls , putting the quarter in , '' said Young .
`` It 's great to be back and feel like I 'm 12 years old again in the arcade . ''
