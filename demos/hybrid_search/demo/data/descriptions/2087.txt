Vocalist and bassist John Cooper told StereoTruth.net : `` Here 's kind of a special song on the record in the sense that it 's very introspective and pensive .
It has me thinking about life and what really matters , questioning `` if I die today , would it matter that I was here ? ''
It 's about making the most of each moment because tomorrow might be one day too late . ''
