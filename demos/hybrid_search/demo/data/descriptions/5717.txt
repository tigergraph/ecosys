Vocalist James Dean Bradfield told the NME May 16 , 2009 that this song , which mentions the 1814 painting Une Odalisque by the French neo-classical painter Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres , `` talks about the idealisation of beauty , or what is ugliness . ''
Like all the other songs on Journal For Plague Lovers album this track originated from words that Manic 's former guitarist Richey Edwards left in a notebook shortly before he disappeared .
This song follows on from `` All Is Vanity , '' which is about narcissism .
Bradfield told the NME : `` I love the way that ` All Is Vanity ' deals with one issue and ` Pretension/Repulsion ' seems to resolve it for me .
In a strange , kind of twisted way .
` Pretension/Repulsion ' could pretty much be another song that just said ' I have no judgment in my eye , I can not behold anything . ' ''
Bassist Nicky Wire commented to the NME : `` It 's one of the greatest rock couplets ever : ` Shards , oh shards , the androgyny fails/Oadlisque by Ingres , extra bones for sale ' .
That 's never gon na appear by anyone else .
It should n't work , but it does .
I just bow down at the altar of that as a lyric . ''
