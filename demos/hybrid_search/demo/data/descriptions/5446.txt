Keyboardist Jesse Johnson discussed this track with Alternative Press : `` This song is a sonic blast that made us feel like we were recording -LSB- 2003 's -RSB- I Am The Movie again .
It has the energy a band would have entering the studio for the first time .
I think that 's what makes it so fun for us to play , since it harkens back to our youth and all the bands we grew up watching play awesome shows .
It 's always amazing to play this song and see the fans sing back with so much emotion . ''
CMU asked frontman Justin Pierre about the band 's songwriting process .
He replied : `` One of us will have a song almost put together , and bring it to the rest of the band , and we tinker until it is completed .
Or somebody plays an idea to the rest of the group , and we all just instinctively join in and come up with the song on the spot .
The latter method happens a lot less often , but does happen from time to time .
Usually we struggle to get songs finished .
There are a lot of tracks that do n't make the cut . ''
In October 2009 , Motion City Soundtrack released this as a free download on their website .
A music video directed by Jessie Cain was released online for the song on November 19 , 2009 .
The My Dinosaur Life album title was derived from Pierre misquoting a line -LRB- `` My dragon life '' -RRB- from the 2008 film American Teen .
