This Calypso-influenced summery song was produced by RedOne .
The frequent Lady Gaga collaborator previously helmed Burke 's Top 10 hit `` Broken Heels . ''
Burke , who is of Jamaican ancestry , blogged about the song when it was released to radio : `` It 's my Summer tune !! LOL !
It 's a new sound for me and I love it because I 'm taking it back to my roots . ''
Burke was inspired to record this reggae flavoured track after buying a a new open-top car .
She told The Sun August 20 , 2010 : `` It 's kind of reggae meets pop .
It was inspired by my Jamaican background and my new convertible .
I really wanted to have a tune I could take down my roof to , drive along and be proud of . ''
The song features Jamaican-American dancehall/urban singer Laza Morgan , whose debut single `` This Girl '' featured on the Step Up 3D movie soundtrack .
This shares a chord sequence and melody with `` Hooray !
Hooray !
It 's a Holi-Holiday , '' a 1979 single by German disco band Boney M .
The song samples the much-covered New Orleans tune , `` Iko Iko . ''
RedOne originally agreed to work with Burke before she won the X-Factor show in 2008 .
She revealed to The Sun : `` He wanted to work with me before I even won the show .
He saw videos and liked me .
At the time , he was in the process of working with GaGa but it was before she became public .
I ca n't believe he had faith in me . ''
The song debuted at # 1 on the UK Singles Chart on September 12 , 2010 , becoming Burke 's third solo chart-topping hit .
Burke told The Sun that her family did not approve of the lace outfit that she wore in the song 's music video .
Said the singer : `` The video has a brave look .
It 's my choice .
I wanted to come out of my box . ''
