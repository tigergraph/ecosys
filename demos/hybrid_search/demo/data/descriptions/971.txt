This potential wedding song finds DeGraw promising his girl everlasting love , and when she needs someone he 'll always be there fighting for her .
It is one of three tracks on Sweeter produced by Butch Walker , who has also worked with the likes of Bowling For Soup -LRB- Girl All The Bad Boys Want -RRB- , Pink -LRB- Mean -RRB- and Weezer -LRB- The Girl Got Hot -RRB- .
DeGraw said of Walker 's contribution to the album in an interview with Billboard magazine : `` He was able to listen to the songs and come in with the right arrangements , bring in the right players for the songs and the right gear for the performances.You do n't always have a magic moment in the studio , '' he continued , `` but you want those moments to happen .
I remember when we were tracking ` Soldier , ' in the second verse I was digging in hard , the groove was so good and everyone was jelling .
I heard Butch go , ` Woo ! '
- a primal scream that said , ` This feels so good . '
You ca n't fake that .
We kept it because you ca n't re-create the performance that makes you do that . ''
Carl Diebold directed the song 's music video .
He explained that the song jumped out on him the first time he heard it .
`` I always look for songs and projects that allow me to tell a story and to inspire people to move and do something , '' said Diebold .
`` When I first heard ` Soldier , ' I could see the potential for weaving several stories into an epic video .
Fortunately the song was released as a single , and Gavin shared my vision . ''
The song was released as the third single from Sweeter .
Said DeGraw : `` It was time for me in my career to release a song that had a sentiment like this one .
It 's something that people from different backgrounds , with a lot of different stories can relate to .
It 's about love and sacrifice - stepping up to the plate when no one else does .
I think people really understand that - and those stories and emotions are what make this song and video so powerful . ''
