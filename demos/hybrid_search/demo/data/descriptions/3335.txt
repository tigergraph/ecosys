This piano and drum laden disco boogie was produced by Matt Friedman , who with his partner Jedd Cappelli collectively make up the duo Illfonics .
Friedman , who helmed this song without Cappeli 's help , told Billboard magazine that sometimes the duo will , `` record a track with a specific artist in mind , but it 'll end up that an artist in a completely different genre will want to use it . ''
He added that this track was a case in point .
Friedman confessed he originally made the beat with `` a few other artists in mind .
Kid Cudi did a really good job matching the track , though , '' he added , `` it 's a really exciting project because they really went the extra mile on it . ''
