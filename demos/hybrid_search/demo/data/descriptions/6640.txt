I Blame Coco is the musical alter ego of one Eliot Pauline Sumner , also known by her nickname , Coco .
She is the daughter of a musician you may have heard of called Sting .
In 2008 she signed with Island Records , and after sending time writing and recording in Sweden she released this debut single on February 1 , 2010 .
The song features the Swedish singer Robyn of `` With Every Heartbeat '' fame .
Coco explained to The Daily Telegraph February 1 , 2010 that she wrote this song to annoy Island Records , who kept pressing her to write a pop hit .
`` It 's just rubbish , '' she snorted .
`` It 's got this political anti-regime thing but it 's full of nonsense lyrics and I was kind of taking the p -- out of pop .
When they said they really liked it , I thought they were joking .
It was a weird feeling , half a kick in the teeth and half a validation .
But , you know , that was another moment when I thought I can actually do this .
I can write rubbish -- and they still like it ! ''
