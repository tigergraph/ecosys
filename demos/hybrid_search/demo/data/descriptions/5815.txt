Vocalist Brent Smith sings of an adversary on this hard-rocking number .
Drummer Barry Kerch explained to Alternative Addiction : `` For me it triggers all the memories that I have in my life of people that have sort of become my enemies .
I remember them .
I think Brent probably had someone specific in mind when he wrote this song , someone from his past .
They are cordial to each other now , but his baby 's mother and Brent were evil to each other .
Also some people did n't believe in this band so it 's a big middle finger to them . ''
Bassist/pianist Eric Bass had this song in his back pocket for a while before getting together for a writing session with Smith and frequent collaborator David Bassett .
`` The guitar riff and the kind of lead solo line was some stuff I 'd had for a couple of months , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` We were kind of going through subject matter that we wanted to write about and going over some things about people who have pissed us off from the past - somebody who 's really divisive , who wedges themselves in between people and tries to tear people apart .
That was the genesis for it , lyrically . ''
