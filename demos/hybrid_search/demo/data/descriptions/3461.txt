Within a short period of time , Marlon Roudette was forced to split up his band , Mattafix , after they lost their record deal then broke up with his fianc√©e .
He explained to The Sun that this reggae - influenced track , `` is about people going through the same pain I went through .
It 's about heartache but togetherness .
I had a guy come up to me and say , ` I 've joined the brotherhood ' as his girlfriend had just left .
I thought that was powerful . ''
It was co-written and produced by Robbie Williams ' songwriting partner Guy Chambers .
The song was released On July 17 , 2011 for free download as a promotional single from Matter Fixed .
