Teen singer Rebecca Black decided to forgo the pay-and-receive video production company Ark Music Factory for her second video single .
Instead she , or more likely her management , enlisted producer Charlton Pettus -LRB- Hilary Duff -RRB- and writers Brandon `` Blue '' Hamilton -LRB- Justin Bieber -RRB- and Quinton Tolbert to craft her follow-up to her `` much ridiculed weekend anthem . ''
The song features `` real '' moments in Black 's life , including her last day at junior high and her rise to stardom .
`` It 's a fairytale story , but it happened in real life , '' said her management .
The song 's music video takes fans behind the scenes , giving them a taste of what life has been like for Black since her rise to fame .
The studio used in the clip is the same location as where Michael Jackson and co recorded `` We Are The World . ''
Black is seen dancing in the video , which also features Robert Roldan and Kent Boyd from the hit Fox show So You Think You Can Dance .
Black explained why she decided to release an inspiration track as a follow-up to `` Friday . ''
`` The song was written for me , '' she told MTV News .
`` And it really fit what was going on and all of the bully and hate topic is in right now with songs , and so it fit that as well .
It 's a very inspiring song.Again , I wanted people to able to take me seriously because I felt like this would be the right thing to do , '' she added .
`` I wanted to start building what could be a really great career , but this industry , it 's so unpredictable : You could be the big thing for a month or four months , and then kind of fall off the face of the planet .
And I felt my whole team kind of felt like it was a great way to put me here for an amount of time . ''
