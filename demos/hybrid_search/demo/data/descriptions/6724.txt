Written by Men at Work frontman Colin Hay , this song is about a man who comes to the realization that the relationship with his wife/girlfriend has run its course and that there 's no purpose in trying to save it .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA -RRB- Hay explained in an interview with Spinner that the song was inspired by a combination of personal experiences .
`` That song was definitely felt quite personal to me , '' he said .
`` It was n't really about one thing ... I mean , the girl that I was going out with , who actually became my first wife , I think some of the song was taken from that relationship .
And then some of it was about coming to Australia -LSB- from Scotland -RSB- -- that always seems to feature quite heavily -LSB- in my work -RSB- , that move and that escapade .
And there 's probably a lot of my mother in there as well .
My mother features quite heavily in a lot of my songs . ''
