This is the title track of American recording artist Demi Lovato 's third studio album .
In the past , Lovato 's music has shown more of a Rock than a R&B influence , but Unbroken finds the singer trying out a much more of a Pop/R & B sound .
`` This album is definitely more pop , '' the Disney star told MTV News .
`` It 's definitely more R&B .
It 's not so Pop/Rock anymore .
I grew up listening to R&B , -LSB- and -RSB- I guess my rock thing was kind of like a phase . ''
Here 's Demi explaining to MTV News why this is her favorite track from Unbroken .
`` What I love about that song so much is that it 's upbeat , it 's fun to dance to , I love blaring it in the car .
It 's one of those songs . ''
Demi penned the song with the Pop/Electronica duo Dreamlab , who comprise the husband and wife team Leah Haywood -LRB- keyboards -RRB- and Daniel James -LRB- vocals , guitars -RRB- .
Dreamlab also produced the tune along with two other Unbroken tracks , `` Hold Up '' and `` Mistake . ''
