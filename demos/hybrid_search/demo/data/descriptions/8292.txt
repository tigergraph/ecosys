Booker T. Jones contributes some Hammond B3 on this track .
Frontman Tim Armstrong explained on the band 's MySpace site how they hooked up with the Stax organ legend : `` We thought a Hammond B-3 would be a good addition .
Vic Rugerio from The Slackers and Roger from The Aggrolties , two of our favorite B-3 players , were unavailable .
Chris from Hellcat suggested Booker T , who happened to be in town mixing his new album for our sister label Anti .
Since we were labelmates , Booker said he 'd love to do it .
Ai n't that something Rancid is labelmates with Booker T , I like the way that sounds .
`` Bassist Matt Freeman added : `` One of the best parts besides watching Booker play was watching all the star-struck studio engineers .
These guys are all old hands who 've seen everything , but Booker was that impressive .
We are very lucky to have him on our record . ''
Let the Dominoes Fall was produced by Epitaph Records founder and Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz .
Drummer Branden Steineckert explained his contribution to this track : `` There was a very live , spontaneous feeling when we tracked this song and the drums were recorded in the first take .
Tim had showed us an idea he had on his acoustic , then we sat around for a minute with Mr. Brett and went over ideas and parts on acoustics .
Then Brett said , ` great , let 's record it ! '
... so my very first time playing this song on drums was what you hear on the record . ''
Rancid explained the track 's meaning : `` This song is about survival at any means necessary .
We understand what it means to hit rock bottom . ''
This was released as the second single from Let The Dominoes Fall .
