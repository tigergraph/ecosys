After drummer Tony Thaxton broke his arm in an accident early on New Years Day 2009 , he feared he would n't recover in time to play on the album .
However the band took the mishap as an opportunity to challenge their songwriting process and keep the creative energy flowing up until they entered the studio in May .
Guitarist Josh Cain explained in publicity materials '' -LSB- If not for the situation with Tony 's arm -RSB- there are some songs that would n't have come out the way they did .
What this process allowed -LSB- us -RSB- to do was flesh my ideas out as much as possible .
-LSB- For example , I was able to give my songs -RSB- to Matt to get his thoughts and then have Justin sing to it .
Tony was then delivered a song that contained everything . ''
This song was one of the ones to benefit from the delay .
Cain told Alternative Press : `` In February 2009 , we had to try new methods of songwriting due to Tony 's broken arm .
We had to work on our ideas at our individual homes and e-mail them back and forth to each other .
I had the idea of ` Hysteria ' sitting in my ideas folder on my laptop gathering dust for around a year .
I spent a bunch of time with it and flushed out the rest of my guitar parts and then emailed it to Matt .
He sent me the song back with bass , keyboards , handclaps , and programmed drums , adding some really great moments to the song .
It was a bit different for us , but everyone seemed to dig it .
Since Tony had to do drums after his arm had healed , we had no clue what direction he was planning on going with it .
I remember sitting in the studio while he recorded the drum parts , finally hearing the song complete .
He had put the final piece to this weird rocking song with some great drum fills that fit perfectly with Justin 's frantic out-of-breath verse melody and anthem chorus melody making this song a band favorite . ''
