Frontman Justin Pierre told Alternative Press that the genesis of this song harks back to 2007 : `` The original idea for this song came while we were recording Even If It Kills Me .
I had a few lines for verses and part of the chorus , but I was n't sure where it was going .
There was n't enough time to explore it back then , so we saved it for this record .
I had this strange image in my head of two people sitting on the roof of a house at night in the fall , shivering slightly and silently together ; their only comfort each other .
I see this song as a melancholy anthem for those of us who really wish we were more than just a science experiment , but fear that that 's probably not the case . ''
