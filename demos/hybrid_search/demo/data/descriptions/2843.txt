This is the title track of Christian pop rock band Relient K 's sixth studio album .
The song 's message is to celebrate future possibilities .
It is a reminder of Paul 's admonition in Philippians 3:13 to `` forget what is behind and strain toward what is ahead . ''
Front man Matt Thiessen said that the overall message of the album is `` about staying positive and not letting the things that get us down get to us . ''
Speaking to The Agency Group , Thiessen said that the song is `` about learning from mistakes and not just focusing on all the things you wished you would 've done differently .
Everyone has those things .
What 's important is the knowledge that when you make a mistake , your life is not over . ''
The song features guest backing vocals from Tim Skipper of the alternative rock band House of Heroes .
Matt Thiessen wrote the songs for Forget and Not Slow Down during early 2009 in an isolated lake house in Winchester , Tennessee .
`` I was by myself for about two or three months , in total isolation , '' he said .
`` It was awesome .
You could think about something , and keep thinking about it , and no one would interrupt you for six or seven hours .
You could keep your brain on one train of thought .
I 'll never want to write another record any other way . ''
This was featured on an episode of the TV show Royal Pains .
