This is one of only three songs that appear in the off-beat 1971 Western McCabe & Mrs. Miller ; all three were written by Leonard Cohen and are performed by him in the film solo .
It is a fairly obvious song about an encounter with either a prostitute or perhaps -LRB- hopefully -RRB- simply a one night stand .
In the film , the relationship is between McCabe and his madam Mrs Miller , a relationship that was doomed to fail , even if McCabe had n't died in the final scene .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England -RRB-
