This was a kind of persuasion song to elect Cooper as president of the United States , and was his commentary on the elections .
He seriously did run for president in 1972 against Richard Nixon .
This is one of the few Alice Cooper songs with composer credits going to the entire band : Cooper , guitarists Glen Buxton and Michael Bruce , bass player Dennis Dunaway , and drummer Neal Smith .
This is a re-write of an earlier Alice Cooper song , `` Reflected , '' off the Pretties For You album in 1969 .
The two songs have completely different lyrics , but are musically similar .
