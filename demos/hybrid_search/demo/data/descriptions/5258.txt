This song is about being on the road .
The `` perfect blue buildings '' are hotels , and `` beds in little rooms in buildings , with lives that are completely meaningless '' refer to hotel rooms .
`` Get me a little oblivion '' probably refers to getting drunk -LRB- or other -RRB- in order to try and cope with having to try and sleep in this sterile , impersonal , surreal environment .
-LRB- thanks , Bruce - Trenton , NJ -RRB- Counting Crows lead singer Adam Duritz wrote this song .
He calls it one of the `` agonizing '' songs - along with `` Round Here '' and `` Ghost Train '' - from the band 's first album .
