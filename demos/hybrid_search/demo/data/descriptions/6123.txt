This was penned by Buckcherry for the soundtrack of the 2012 movie The Avengers , though it was originally intended for the band 's Confessions album .
Guitarist Keith Nelson told Artist Direct : `` We basically had the opportunity to be a part of the movie .
We understand and appreciate the size and weight of having a song as part of a soundtrack .
When we were approached , we were actually in writing mode for Confessions .
We 'd been working on a few ideas , and Stevie -LRB- D -RRB- had this riff that seemed appropriate .
We had just started writing ` Wherever I Go ' and thought it would be a good candidate for The Avengers though , so we finished it with that in mind . ''
The riff evolved from the band throwing stuff at each other .
Said Nelson to Artist Direct : `` Stevie actually came in with that main part of the riff .
Stevie and I started with that , making a quick demo with the drum machine .
It was a bit like we start every idea .
We brought it to the band and everybody plugged in .
Then , it had this bombastic quality to it .
We were all really excited early on . ''
Nelson explained Josh Todd 's lyrics to Artist Direct : `` Lyrically , I think it 's definitely a tormented person .
The lyric is ` Wherever I go , my mind goes with me ' so there 's a bit of torment in there .
I think Josh really felt a connection to a few of the characters in the movie . ''
