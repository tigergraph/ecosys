This tune was transformed after Dido played it to her older brother Rollo Armstrong .
She told The Sun : `` That track shows off his talents .
I wrote that song on the guitar , It was a country song that I played to him in the kitchen .
He said , ` It 's actually 140 beats a minute , which is sort of perfect ' and he came back with that track .
`` Rollo Armstrong is a record producer , who is one of the founder members of electronic group Faithless .
