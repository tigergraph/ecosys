Monsters of Folk are an indie supergroup made up of Jim James of My Morning Jacket , Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis of Bright Eyes , and indie singer-songwriter M. Ward .
Mogis , who also produced the album , recalled the recording of this track to Express Night Out : `` That was kind of a collaborative thing -LSB- a repetitive motif where each vocalist repeats the same line back and forth -RSB- .
There 's sort of weird effects that go with it .
I honestly ca n't remember who 's idea it was , I think Jim just did that `` There and then you 're gone , '' and then Conor was like , `` You should do it again . ''
And then that call and response thing -LSB- emerged -RSB- .
I put some treatments to the vocals to give it reappearing and disappearing sort of feel , so it does n't feel quite as obvious .
I think it was like a group brainstorming moment where everyone was throwing the same idea out at the same time . ''
