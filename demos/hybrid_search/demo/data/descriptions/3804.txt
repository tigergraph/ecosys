This suggestive number is the first single from American R&B singer Ciara 's fourth studio album , Basic Instinct .
The song was produced by Tricky Stewart and co-written by The-Dream and Ciara .
The song 's music video was filmed in Los Angeles on March 30 , 2010 and also features Ludacris .
It was directed by Diane Martel , who previously helmed the clips for the singer 's 2006 single `` Promise , '' 2007 's `` Like a Boy , '' and 2009 's `` Love Sex Magic .
`` The BET network asked Ciara to edit the clip due to its sexual content , but did not get a response .
As a result they banned the saucy video .
Additionally , according to the singer 's official website , it was banned from all UK TV channels .
In an interview with the London freesheet Metro published July 12 , 2010 , when Ciara was asked what the song was about she replied , `` It 's about riding hard for your man 's love '' .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England -RRB- The song features Ciara 's fellow Atlantan , Ludacris .
It is their fourth collaboration ; they previously worked together on 2005 's `` Oh '' , 2009 's `` High Price '' and the 2010 remix to Ludacris ' single `` How Low . ''
It was The-Dream who suggested Ciara re-team with Ludacris .
He told MTV news : `` I brought Luda in , because I felt like her and Luda have had so much success together , they just sound right together .
Especially on that record , ` Ride , ' that 's the first record me and Trick did -LSB- for Basic Instinct -RSB- .
It sounded like Luda , and it sounded like Ciara .
So -LSB- we -RSB- blessed the summertime with both of them . ''
