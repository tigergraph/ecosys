In Islamic law , a fatwa is an authoritative legal opinion on a point of doctrine .
In 1988 , British novelist Salman Rushdie provoked outrage in the Islamic world following publication of his allegedly blasphemous book The Satanic Verses .
The following year the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa calling for the death of Rushdie .
Yusuf found himself courting controversy when addressing students at Kingston University , he allegedly expressed support of the Ayatollah 's fatwa on Rushdie , though the singer accused the media of misrepresenting his position .
He told The Sunday Times July 26 , 2009 that the episode inspired this song .
`` It 's about finding myself being chased by a wild pack of lies , whenever something controversial happens . ''
In an interview with The Sun May 1 , 2009 , Yusuf likened the mood and arrangement of this song to `` Pop Star '' from the first of his Island records , 1970 's Mona Bone Jakon .
