This song was originally written for Take That 's Progress album but did n't make the final track listing .
Gary Barlow said on his official website : `` We were all so disappointed that this song did n't make the original record Progress .
The chorus lyric was eluding the finishing line .
Just as we thought we had it we came back the next day and hated it .
And so we revisited it when we had the idea of doing an add-on album , funny that it was so obvious what it should be when we played it .
It 's one of my favourites this one .
Emotional and powerful . ''
