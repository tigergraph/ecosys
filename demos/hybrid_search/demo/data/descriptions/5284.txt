Kooks vocalist Luke Pritchard found himself writing lyrics containing a lot of emotional drama for their third album and the phrase `` junk of the heart '' kept coming back to him .
He told Spin magazine : `` Even before we went to record , I wanted to name the album that .
It made sense .
The songs lyrically are about baggage , my ` Junk of the Heart . '
I got very obsessed with the relationship between pain and love , and how you ca n't have one without the other .
` Junk of the Heart ' represents that for me in one phrase . ''
This song is the album 's title track and second single .
During the writing of Junk of the Heart -LRB- Happy -RRB- Pritchard became `` obsessed '' with the French electronic duo Air and they were a significant influence on this song 's sound .
He told Spin : `` The synthesizers on ` Junk of the Heart ' all came from that desire for the eerie and nostalgic feel you get on Air 's record .
When I was writing the last two Kooks records I was inspired by music from the '60s and '70s .
But for this album , the whole idea was to rethink it and make it really modern . ''
