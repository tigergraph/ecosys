This is the opening track of Synthetica , the fifth studio album to be released by Canadian indie rock band Metric .
According to guitarist James Shaw , the first sound that can he heard , a pulsating , grimy throb , is `` the foundation of the album . ''
He said : `` Oddly enough , it 's actually not a synthesizer .
It 's a '60s organ played through a homemade pedal dreamed up by a local wizard who posted an ad on Craiglist . ''
