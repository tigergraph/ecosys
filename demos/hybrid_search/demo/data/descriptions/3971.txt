This was produced by Hip Hop producer/singer Ron Browz .
Busta told MTV News that on this song he 's `` trying to implement the boom-bap .
Because it 's time for the records to feel like when you in the club ... they 're knocking your block off , and they still got lyrics to 'em and they still making you feel good with the catchy choruses . ''
He added that two other songs on Back on my B.S. , '' ` Wheel of Fortune ' -LSB- and -RSB- ` I 'm a Go and Get My , ' those songs consist of that boom-bap as well . ''
Busta described this to HipHop.com as `` some shake ya ass s -- t - enjoy yourself music ! ''
