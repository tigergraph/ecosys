Three Nil is a term used for an embarrassing defeat .
Three Nil is 3-0 .
This song is also about being put on display in your shame : `` I 'm sick of being the butt of a cosmic joke and I do n't get the punchline .
A million people lined up for miles to see the great big mouth .
Shut up and Apologize ! ''
At a show in Stockholm , Sweden , lead singer Corey Taylor said : `` This song lets you know right up front , we are here to destroy you ! ''
