The title of this mid-tempo rocker suggests a critique of American policy abroad , however frontman Colin Meloy told Spin magazine that it is n't specifically about the War in Iraq .
`` In some ways , it 's political but I have not attributed it to anything , '' he said .
`` I think of it more as a song for somebody who 's up against great odds , whether political or social . ''
The track closes with a raw recording of a woman singing about her dog running through a field , accompanied by banjo and harmonica .
The female voice belongs to studio owner , Sherry Pendarvis , and she is accompanied by Chris Funk and Jenny Conlee of the Portland troubadours jamming on a porch .
`` She was sitting out front with her dog , '' Meloy told Spin .
`` She had just been to the vet and she was soaking the dog 's paw and started making up this song . ''
