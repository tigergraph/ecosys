This slice of raga-rock features a lyric inspired by a poem that Weller 's little girl Jessie wrote at school .
He explained at a listening session for the album : `` My youngest daughter Jessie had this poem she wrote for school .
I just took the first line from each verse and built on them .
She does get credited , yes ! ''
Noel Gallagher also plays on three tracks on the album making Sonik Kicks one of the few records to feature contributions from members of both Blur and Oasis .
`` I 'm the punk rock Henry Kissinger , '' commented Weller to Uncut , when the magazine pointed this out .
Blur 's Graham Coxon contributes both guitar and Hammond organ to this track , though he did n't know that he 'd be playing the latter on the day he turned up .
`` There 's no time to reflect when you work with Paul , '' laughed the guitarist to Mojo magazine .
`` When I played on this record I felt like a three-legged terrier chasing a rat .
I could n't keep up .
And it seemed so complicated to me , this music .
You go , Paul , that 's shockingly weird .
And , he 'll be like , ` Yeah , is n't it ?! ' he 's perfectly accepting of it . ''
