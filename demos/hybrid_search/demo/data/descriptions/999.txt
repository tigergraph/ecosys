This song tells how lead singer Jon Davis ' dad wanted him to stay out of the music industry , since he experienced it himself .
He wanted Jon to `` become something I can never ever be '' as depicted in the lyrics .
Jon Davis told Artist Direct : '' It 's about me working in the mortuary at the coroner 's office -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
It 's also about my parents not wanting me to be a musician . ''
-LRB- thanks , Danny - Clifton , NJ -RRB- Korn are about sound more than anything else , and Brian `` Head '' Welch 's high chime-y melody plus James `` Munky '' Shaffer 's Peter Frampton-esque guitar talkbox was a memorable combination .
Welch recalled to Artist Direct : `` I was going for a toy box sound .
You open up a jewelry box or one of those little kid things and it does that sound .
It 's all pretty .
Then , the dark thing Munky did with the effect is chilling .
That eerie , evil sound with that toy box thing was one-of-a-kind .
I love that . ''
