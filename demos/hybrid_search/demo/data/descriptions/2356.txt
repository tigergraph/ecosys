One of the slower songs on the album , it is probably about a girlfriend who the singer really loves , but she is interfering with his Rock n ' Roll lifestyle .
Another song with the same message is `` Free Bird '' by Lynyrd Skynyrd .
The Stones used several different piano players over the years .
This song features Nicky Hopkins , who also played with The Beatles , The Who , The Climax Blues Band , The Kinks , Jefferson Airplane and many others .
