This was the first single to be taken from LA-based , pop-punk outfit Say Anything 's self-titled fourth album .
Frontman Max Benis explained this song and its context with the album to Alternative Press : `` The entire album is a narrative and each song tells a different part of a certain story : the result of recognizing what is wrong with the world .
It 's a feeling of anger , and when you experience this anger , it surfaces at first as this irrational stupid hatred of everyone and everything .
This song is about that emotion .
That 's why it 's kind of tongue-in-cheek .
I wrote this song going through that exact period myself and I was kind of waking up about how I was living my life in a negative way .
I started to see the bigger picture a bit more , and it was very depressing and it affected me greatly .
I felt like I hated everyone this one particular morning when I wrote the song , and I started to work my way past it .
I believe it 's an important stage in human evolution for each person to have this feeling and work through it . ''
Front man Max Bemis blogged on MySpace some details about the album : `` The running theme of the record is finding the mental superhero within yourself despite having seen some dark times .
After all of the stuff you 've heard me sing and write about that overtook me for the better part of a decade , I finally found a way to fight back , and this is the story of how . ''
