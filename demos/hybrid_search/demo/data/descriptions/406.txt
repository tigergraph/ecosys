Lead singer and songwriter Robin Pecknold -LRB- from Daytrotter -RRB- : `` This song is really really simple .
It 's basically about how sad it can sometimes be when people grow apart for no other reason besides growing older , like friends from grade school who 're united by comic books and Nintendo often end up going in completely different directions once they reach Middle and High School - that happened to me a lot and it seems like a shame .
I wish I would 've been smart enough to hold onto my friends at that age even though we started getting into different kinds of things .
What do ` things ' matter anyway when a friendship 's in the balance . ''
`` Musically , this started as two different songs -LRB- the only two sections of the song -RRB- that got slammed together kind of clumsily into what we 've got now , '' Pecknold continued .
`` I had that song El Condor Pasa -LRB- If I Could -RRB- in mind when we were working on this but it did n't really turn out sounding like that .
Too much reverb or something . ''
