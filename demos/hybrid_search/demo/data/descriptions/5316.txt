This is a song that singer/songwriter Jo Dee Messina says is about an ex-boyfriend who she dated for `` about a minute and a half . ''
The experience left her shaking her head , and provided fodder for this kiss-off tune , which she sings with customary hand-dusting attitude .
`` I thought it was weird that here 's a guy , 30-some-odd years old , that would call his mother every day and just get advice on stuff .
And he would always be like , ` Mom says ... Mom says ... ' First of all , she 's not my mother , and - what ?? '' But then it got better .
`` He started to call his ex-girlfriend .
And he was like , ` Well , my ex-girlfriend thinks that ... ' And I 'm like , ` Dude , that 's weird . '
There 's too many people in this relationship . ''
It was about that time , says Jo Dee , that the ex-girlfriend flexed her vocal cords .
`` She was going around town telling everybody , ` He 's been calling me .
Oh yes , he 's gon na come back to me . '
And she 's trying to prove that she has him .
She 's spending her time , she 's wasting my time trying to prove that she has him .
It 's very literal .
When I was writing this I spoke the words that are now part of the song , that she 's spending her time , she 's wasting mine in the process trying to prove that she has him .
Truth is , she can have him , because I 'm done with him .
I 'm done with that crap .
I do n't need that in my life .
That 's bad juju , '' she laughs .
`` That 's some bad energy . ''
