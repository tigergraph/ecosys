As the lyrics helpfully point out , this song 's title is an anagram of Ian Brown .
He told Clash Magazine : `` Yeah that 's the anagram of my own name .
It could of been ` Brain No ' , or it could have been ` Born Awi ' ... I like me anagrams -LRB- laughs -RRB- .
I was working with a kid called Peter Mescle who was DJ Mick and his real name is Peter Mescle and he said do you realise you name is ` Own Brain ' and mine 's ` Sample Elect ' ... so I was like let 's do a tune called ` Own Brain ' , I wanted to do an album called ` Own Brain ' .
And then I thought ` My Way ' was a bit cheeky . ''
