This song talks about lost love , something Neil Young has much experience with .
The song contrasts Young 's love for his Coupe de Ville with his longing for a lost lover , drawing attention to how material possessions , no matter how nice , never really end up fulfilling you .
`` If I ca n't have you , '' he wails on the chorus , `` I do n't want nothin ' else . ''
This song was included on the album Young produced with his new band , The Blue Notes .
This caught the attention of musician Harold Melvin , who owned the rights to the `` Blue Notes '' name .
While Young was on tour with his new band , Melvin sued him over the name rights and won .
Young was forced to re-name his band `` Ten Men Workin ' '' for the remainder of the tour .
Cadillac introduced the first Coupe de Ville in 1949 , boasting a two-door coupe style , leather interior , and a pillar-less hard-top .
Offered at $ 3,497 - considered expensive for the time - it was one of Cadillac 's most popular models , and by 1961 the company was selling over 20,000 of the vehicles annually .
