This is a sort of `` jingle '' tune written by McCartney on his ukulele .
In the late '60s and early '70s , Paul used to carry along this instrument everywhere when he was wandering around New York City .
The words `` Ram '' and `` On '' form the name `` Ramon , '' which was one of Paul 's pseudonyms when he was in The Beatles .
The song is about being straightforward , courageous and strong .
The ram is also the name of the animal chosen as the title track of the album , which meant for Paul to ram against the things that were making him depressed at the times of the Beatles breakup .
Plus , it refers to the sheep and rams he had at his Scottish farm in the Mull of Kintyre .
