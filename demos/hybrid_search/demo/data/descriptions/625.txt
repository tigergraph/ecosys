Miller sings of the difficulties of love on this Pharrell-produced , Jazz-inspired cut .
`` Just a little taste and you know she got you , '' he wails before eventually choosing to leave his pain in the `` rear view . ''
Miller told MTV 's RapFix Live host Sway Calloway that he did n't write the song about a specific female , but he did draw from real-life experiences .
`` What I like to do when I 'm writing a song like this is something in my life that happens .
I take the emotion , '' he said .
We hear Miller singing about how one has can experience a high after going through heartbreak .
`` Listen to me , I ` mma set you free .
Yeah , he ai n't gon na break your heart again .
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy .
When your imagination 's on pretend . ''
Miller explained the lyric on RapFix Live : `` I 'm a little bit weird with saying exactly what is going on in my life , so you take that emotion and you create a situation in your head , and you come up with something .
Then , you apply that emotion into that situation and build characters , '' he said .
`` You got ta go through the really bad to appreciate that ecstasy -- that actual feeling of ecstasy . ''
