Co-penned by Babyshambles frontman Peter Doherty a decade after he first admitted to problems with addiction , this Country-flavored song is a frank confrontation of the ugliness of his condition .
Doherty commented to NME : `` This was mostly written by -LRB- band associate -RRB- John Robinson from The Bandits who I wrote ' I Am the Rain ' with .
It 's got a nice , friendly guitar lick , Ã  la Bob Dylan . ''
