This song is about dealing with a relationship that has ended .
It 's possible that Jack White wrote it about his relationship with actress Rene Zellweger .
Some of the lyrical clues : `` Take a mountain , turn it into a mole '' - White and Zellweger met on the set of the movie Cold Mountain .
`` Playing a different role '' - Could be a reference to Zellweger 's acting talents .
`` Never do it with a singer 'cause he 'll tell everyone in the world '' - This could be Jack speaking out in this song .
Michel Gondry , who is famous for his wildly imaginative and somewhat distorted work , directed the video .
Gondry has directed videos for Daft Punk , Kylie Minogue , Bj√∂rk and many others .
He also directed the movie Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind , which features size distortion similar to what he used in this video .
