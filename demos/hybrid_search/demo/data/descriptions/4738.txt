Singer Tom Higgenson told Alternative Press magazine : `` The first verse and chorus of this song were written in five minutes , exactly where they say they were written : sitting on a bed all alone in a hotel room , counting the days until I get to go home and see my girl .
It 's very literal and sincere , which I think is my strong point at times .
This song gives me the feeling I got when I wrote ` Hey There Delilah , ' and ' 1 2 3 4 . ' ''
