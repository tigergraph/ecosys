Green Day close their ยก Dos !
album with this rock 'n' roll tribute to Amy Winehouse .
Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong told NME : `` I did n't know her , I just thought it was a tragic loss .
It 's interesting because of you think about ยก Dos !
, it 's a party record and so at the end of it maybe Amy kind of comes across as the consequences of the party .
It happened last summer , around this time , I believe , and I just thought her music and her taste in music was so connected to old soul music and the original Motown and Otis Redding and Sam Cooke and things like that .
And I think that was a major loss because that was a generation 's connection to that , and this was someone who should be here now and I just felt really sad .
Oh my god , this huge musical figure that just got lost and , you know , that sucks . ''
