Paul Weller co-wrote this with Blur guitarist Graham Coxon , who also played drums , guitars and provided the backing vocals .
Weller said of this song : `` This was originally the B-side of the ` This Old Town ' single I did with Graham Coxon , -LRB- which reached # 39 in the UK in 2007 -RRB- .
I did n't feel it got enough attention at the time so I thought I 'd dust it off and give it a bit more exposure .
You can hear the sound of me tap dancing on the chorus if you listen closely .
I like to do a bit of tap ! ''
This was the first of several collaborations on the album , something Weller was not previously noted for in his solo career .
Uncut magazine July 2008 asked the former Jam and Style Council frontman why this time so many of the tracks were co-written with friends .
He replied : `` I 've often chatted to Bobby Gillespie or Noel Gallagher about co-writing , but I always feel a bit self-conscious doing the old-fashioned thing where there 's two of you in a rehearsal room , slogging it out on acoustic guitars .
But the collaboration with Graham Coxon changed my mind about that .
It was more of a long-distance thing , which involved sending each other demos on tapes or CDs .
One person would make changes and send back another disc , and you 'd both chip away at the music .
I 'm much more comfortable working like that . ''
