Grey started singing at the age of two , playing piano at six and by the age of fourteen had made three folk albums with her mother .
But her teenage years were n't the easiest and this song recalls her battle with being an outsider .
She told The Sun : `` I was the girl nobody liked at school .
I just was n't interested in things girls my age were .
I felt older than them and I just locked myself away writing and performing .
It was my escape . ''
Ca n't find the song on your Do n't Look Down record ?
It was included as a bonus track on the Target Deluxe Edition .
