This song is an homage to the legendary skateboarder , Keenan Milton , who died tragically in 2001 in a freak accident .
Banhart explained to Spin magazine : `` Supposedly he was at a party and somebody jumped off the roof into the pool and actually hit him , and nobody noticed and he drowned .
He died much too young , under very tragic circumstances .
He skated for Chocolate , which is part of Girl Skateboards , probably one of the most , if not the most important skateboarding companies of contemporary American skateboarding brands .
Keenan had chosen a song -LSB- for a video -RSB- called ' 007 -LRB- Shanty Town -RRB- ' by Desmond Dekker , and that changed my life .
I had never heard anything like it . ''
