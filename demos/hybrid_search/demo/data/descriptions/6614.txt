Much of Fork In the Road was inspired by Young 's involvement with the LincVolt project , in which Young and his partner , biodiesel pioneer Jonathan Goodwin , retrofitted the singer 's own 1959 Lincoln Continental with an experimental electric engine .
This garage rocker is an ode to Goodwin , known as the `` motorhead messiah , '' who told Rolling Stone that he has little interest in his partner 's other career .
He said : `` For the first month I thought he was Neil Diamond .
I guess he is another singer .
My wife told me ` That 's Neil Young .
He sings the older songs . '
To this day I 've never listened to any of his music . ''
This song was debuted via video ahead of the album 's release .
The video featured Neil singing and air-guitaring while taking the LincVolt for a test drive .
