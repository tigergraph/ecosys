This final track on the album conveys the sort of message that the Reverend Al would like to leave all of us with .
Green explained on the EMI press release : '' ` Standing in the Rain ' - that do n't mean good times .
I 've got afflictions , I 've got trials , I 've experienced all the things that can hold you back .
But I refuse to be held back . ''
