This spare , dramatic ballad is the one song on 100 Miles From Memphis for which Crow has sole writing credit .
Lyrically , the song struggles with some hard truths .
`` That one is really a plea to make everything quit going so fast , '' she explained .
`` Life has reached this epic point of being out of control .
There 's so much chaos everywhere you look .
And especially when you have a little kid , you just want to protect the people you love from all that pain . ''
