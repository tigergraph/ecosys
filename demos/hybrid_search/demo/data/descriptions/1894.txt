For this song , Swift wanted to replicate the sounds of the songs Jacknife Lee has produced for the likes of U2 and Snow Patrol .
So not only did she recruit the latter band 's lead singer , Gary Lightbody , to co-write and duet with her , but she recruited the producer himself to helm the whimsical orchestral ballad .
Gary Lightbody is one of several songwriters that Swift reached out to write with her on Red .
She told Billboard magazine that the people she chose to collaborate with were ones who inspired her .
`` Snow Patrol are so absolutely dead-on , '' she said , `` they can just hit you when they are singing about loss or longing . ''
