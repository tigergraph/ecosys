Phoenix singer Thomas Mars explained to the Washington DC free newspaper Express that Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix producer Philippe Zdar was responsible for this song .
Said Mars `` He left with this demo that we threw away and when he came back he already had memories with it .
He had the best holiday .
And he said , ` There 's no way this song is n't going be on the record ; if it 's not on the record I 'll leave right now . '
We tried to incorporate it and it really did n't fit -LSB- at first -RSB- .
We try to make -LSB- the tunes -RSB- breathe and this song is really the most electronic ... It 's basically like giving life to these -LSB- electronic -RSB- instruments . ''
