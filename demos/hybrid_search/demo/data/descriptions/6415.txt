This is a track from My Kinda Party , the fourth studio album released by American Country music artist Jason Aldean .
The song finds the protagonist enjoying his vices and his lover too much to give either up .
The track was co-written by Thomas Rhett Akins , the son of Country songwriter Rhett Akins -LRB- `` All About Tonight '' , `` The Shape I 'm In '' , `` Farmer 's Daughter '' -RRB- .
This was the junior Akins ' first songwriting credit for a major label artist.He told Billboard magazine the cut came at a pivotal time .
`` I would say that was a huge turning point in my life , '' said Akins .
`` I 'd been writing songs for about five or six months pretty hard , and I was trying to balance songwriting and school - which was a pretty hard task .
I wrote it with two other guys who had never had a cut , so for three no name writers to get our first cut on the Album of the Year was an incredible experience as an amateur songwriter . ''
