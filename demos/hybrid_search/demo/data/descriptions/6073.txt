Brent Smith of Shinedown is the guest vocalist on this Diane Warren penned track .
Apocalyptica drummer Mikko Siren explained the hook up : `` We met Brent two years ago and we saw Shinedown live .
We were really impressed with his voice .
So when we had the song we remembered him , we asked him in and we were lucky enough that he agreed . ''
The song was released as the third single from 7th Symphony .
However Smith does n't appear on the US release of the single because the band did n't do the paperwork .
Instead , the American single , which came out on January 18 , 2011 , features Doug Robb of Hoobastank .
