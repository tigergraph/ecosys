This was one of the songs that earned Eddie Vedder the job of Pearl Jam frontman .
His acquaintance Jack Irons sent him a 3-song instrumental demo recorded by Jeff Ament , Stone Gossard and Mike McCready , who were looking for a lead singer for their new band .
In one day , Vedder wrote lyrics for the three songs and added his vocals using a four track recorder .
The result was what Vedder called the `` Momma-Son '' mini opera , with the first song `` Alive '' telling the story of a boy who learns his dad is actually his stepfather .
In `` Once , '' the boy goes crazy and kills people .
The third part of the trilogy is `` Footsteps , '' where the boy ends up on death row and blames his mother for his problems .
When the band heard the demo , they quickly offered Eddie the job , and a few weeks later he joined them in Seattle to record much of what would become the Ten album , including this song .
At the end of the song , Vedder does some mumbling .
He 's saying : `` You think I 've got my eyes closed , but looking at you the whole f * cking time . ''
Guitarist Stone Gossard wrote the music for this track .
Although Vedder conceived this song as the second part of a trilogy , it was placed first on Pearl Jam 's debut album Ten , which went on to sell over 10 million copies .
