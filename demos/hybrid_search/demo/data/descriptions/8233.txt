This is the second Hip Hop/Rap song ever to win an Oscar for Best Original Song , the first being 2002 's `` Lose Yourself '' -LRB- Eminem , from the film 8 Mile -RRB- .
When Three 6 Mafia performed the song live at the 2006 Academy Awards , it also marked the first time that a Hip Hop/Rap song was ever performed at the ceremony .
-LRB- thanks , Jimoh - The Bronx NY , NY -RRB- When Three 6 Mafia gave their acceptance speech at the Oscars , censors bleeped out a few choice words .
It was n't until the 2011 awards when another speech was bleeped : Melissa Leo dropped the F word when she won for Best Supporting Actress in The Fighter .
