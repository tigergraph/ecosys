On this track , you can hear the sound of Oldfield 's trusted tubular bells .
However the English musician insisted that the chimes are present on this piece only because they are a regular part of any symphony orchestra .
Oldfield explained to the Daily Mail March 14 , 2008 : `` I do n't really think of this as a classical album .
I 'm not a musicologist , so I do n't know what officially constitutes a classical album .
But those opening notes of ` Tubular Bells ' have been ripped off by so many people that I figured I might as well rip them off myself . ''
Music Of The Spheres is a classical piece , with its instrumental ideas transposed for an orchestra by modern classical composer Karl Jenkins .
`` Music Universalis '' is Latin for `` Music of the Sphere , '' which was is an ancient philosophical theory credited to the ancient Greek mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras .
This concept regards proportions in the movements of the Sun , Moon and planets as a form of music .
According to Aristotle , Pythagoras said `` There is geometry in the humming of the strings .
There is music in the spacings of the spheres . ''
