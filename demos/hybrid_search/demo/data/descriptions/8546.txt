The song is about the murder of San Francisco mayor George Moscone and his aide Harvey Milk -LRB- `` I blew George and Harvey 's brains out with my six-gun '' -RRB- by police officer Dan White , who later managed to get out of a double murder sentence through a rather peculiar insanity defense - he claimed he went temporarily insane after eating too many Twinkies -LRB- `` Twinkies are the best friends I ever had '' -RRB- even though there is evidence the murders were premeditated .
This song was featured in the second season Crime Story episode `` Pauli Taglia 's Dream . ''
During portions of the titular dream , John Santucci lip-synchs to the song .
