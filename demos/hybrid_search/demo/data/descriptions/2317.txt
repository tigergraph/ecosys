A Fine Frenzy opens her third album , Pines , with its title track .
Alison Sudol , who is the sole A Fine Frenzy member , explained in an interview with Anthropologie how the title came about : `` The record tells the story of a lonesome pine , '' she said , `` the last tree standing in a wasteland where a great forest once lived .
There 's a tremendous amount of longing - or pining , as it may be - so the name is partially a reference to that .
It 's easy to spend days and decades consumed by the memory of something lost .
Sometimes , you have to go on a journey to leave the past behind and find a new way to live , which is what this record is about : choosing to live , let go and grow . ''
