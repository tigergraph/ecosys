This romantic ballad finds Labrinth duetting with `` Heaven '' songstress Emeli Sandé .
Labrinth explained to The Sun : `` Me and -LRB- `` Cooler Than Me '' singer -RRB- Mike Posner were working together and came up with this .
Emeli came in later on .
We decided to get her on the record because she 's a great talent .
I love her . ''
After slipping out of the UK singles chart the previous week , the grammatically-challenged `` Beneath Your Beautiful '' rebounded to # 1 following a show-stealing performance by Emeli Sandé on the X Factor show .
The song was the last track to be lifted from Electronic Earth .
`` Usually when you 're on your last single and you 've gone to the end of your album , it 's the first singles that explode , '' Labrinth commented to Digital Spy .
`` So to achieve a number one on the last single was quite sick . ''
Asked by Billboard magazine why he picked Sandé as the female perspective on the track , Labrinth replied : `` Emeli , I felt , had enough soul .
And enough lyrical ability along with it to represent that area of the song . ''
The song also featured on the repackaged deluxe edition of Sandé 's debut album Our Version Of events , which was released on October 8 , 2012 .
Labrinth 's only previous # 1 was as an unaccredited vocalist on Tinie Tempah 's debut single `` Pass Out . ''
He also achieved a brace of # 2 singles , Tempah second single `` Frisky '' on which he was credited as a featured artist and his own solo hit `` Earthquake . ''
Emeli Sande had already topped the chart as a featured artist on Professor Green 's `` Read All About It . ''
The song jumped into the higher reaches of the US iTunes sales chart following a stellar TV performance by Labrinth and Sandé on America 's Got Talent .
