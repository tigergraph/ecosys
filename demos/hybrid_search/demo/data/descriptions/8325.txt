This is the opening track from English indie rock singer-songwriter Paul Weller 's tenth solo studio album , Wake Up The Nation .
The record was produced and co-written by Simon Dine at Paul 's Black Barn studios in Surrey .
This raucous R&B track features a contribution by Bev Bevan from ELO and The Move .
Weller said on his website : `` Bev Bevan plays drums on this one .
Simon and I are big psychedelic music fans , so it was a real buzz .
I was back to being a ten year old Move fan again . ''
