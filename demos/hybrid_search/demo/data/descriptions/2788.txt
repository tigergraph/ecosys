The lyrics are odd , in that the aim for The Clash coming into recording the Cut the Crap album was to take the band back to their 1977 UK Punk roots .
The lyrics of `` Dirty Punk '' are very American-centric , featuring lines such as `` rock up your neighborhood , '' `` up your boulevard . ''
The song talks about a stereotypical dysfunctional suburban American family , including the arguing parents -LRB- `` I could hear your momma scream , She 's gon na waste herself away , When your daddy smashed that TV screen , I understand what he had to say '' -RRB- and the clean-cut hunky brother getting drunk , picking up women and going off the rails -LRB- `` While my brother dresses clean , He used to be the local hunk , The girls all ride in my machine , How bout the time I made him drunk , And he insult my brotherhood '' -RRB- .
This song was only performed twice by The Clash , both times in 1984 at the Brixton Miner 's Benefit gigs in December of that year .
The music is also oddly US-centric , sounding more like a brash '80s Hair Metal track not unlike the thrashier elements of Def Leppard or Bon Jovi , although most critics cited `` Dirty Punk '' as one of the few good moments on the Cut the Crap album -LRB- which may just be because the rest of the album was so terrible -RRB- .
