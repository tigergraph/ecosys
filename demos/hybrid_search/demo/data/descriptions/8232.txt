Buxton co-wrote this autobiographical song with Country music songwriter Bob DiPiero .
She told The Boot : `` Rather than write a song about my first apartment or a song about how I got married too young and a song about moving to town in my boots , it 's about all those things .
The deeper meaning is that we are all born of this country , and the country 's history is a part of us .
We all have an opportunity to do whatever we want . ''
