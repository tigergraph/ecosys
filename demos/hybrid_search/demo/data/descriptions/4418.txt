Mavis Staples recorded this Washington Phillips gospel standard for her 2013 album One True Vine .
It was originally recorded by The Staple Singers for their 1964 This little Light album .
Mavis recalled to Mojo magazine : `` I heard that song before The Staple Singers .
I used to go to church with my grandmother down in Mississippi and that 's when I first heard it .
When I come home pops was singing with an all-male group .
They were jubilee singers and they were singing it fast .
I listen to that song now and think about my mother and my father and you know I just lost my sister Cleotha and I think about them .
What are they doing ?
Maybe momma 's making sweet potato pie .
You know , Pops would visit disc jockeys and take a sweet potato pie along with our record .
One of the disc jockeys he said on the radio , ' I tell ya one thing , these Staple Singers , they do n't need no payola .
They got pie-ola . ''
