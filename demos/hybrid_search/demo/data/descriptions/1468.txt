The song 's lyrical meaning deals with the intense mainstream attention Seattle Rock bands experienced during the early '90s .
Mudhoney lead singer/guitarist Mark Arm told us , `` There was a certain amount of frustration in terms of the changes that had happened locally to shows in the '80s .
There was a small group of people , maybe a couple hundred , that went to shows and you maybe did n't know everyone , but you knew them by sight .
And all of a sudden , you 'd go to a show and none of those people were around anymore .
All you saw was this new group of people who got turned on to local music by MTV or something .
It was really weird .
So it was just a reaction to that .
I was trying to keep it funny and light as well .
I was n't really going to move out of town . ''
Mudhoney never got the big payday , but they were an influential and credible band deserving of a spot on the soundtrack of Singles .
Directed by Cameron Crowe , the film featured a bizarro version of Pearl Jam -LRB- Citizen Dick in the movie -RRB- fronted by Matt Dillon and with Eddie Vedder on drums .
The movie was n't specifically about the music scene in the area , but that culture was part of the backdrop .
By the time the film was released in 1992 , Grunge music was everywhere and flannel was in fashion.Mudhoney never bought into the hype , but they did cash in on the $ 20,000 budget they were given to record this song for the Singles soundtrack .
Mark Arm tells us they spent about $ 164 to record the song , and pocketed the rest .
