Howard Donald sings lead on this folksy tune , which was co-written by the band with the London indie folk duo Turin Brakes .
He also sings lead on `` What Is Love . ''
Donald originally told the other Take That members that he did n't want to sing any leads on The Circus , but was persuaded by them that his voice was the best fit for those two tracks .
He explained to The Sun November 21 , 2008 : `` I try to get more involved in the harmonies than anything else .
I love the melodic side of our songs .
Even when it comes to the lyrics , I take a back seat .
I sometimes get frustrated with writing lyrics , especially as these guys find it so easy .
I have to take some time out to go and play the drums until I calm down . ''
