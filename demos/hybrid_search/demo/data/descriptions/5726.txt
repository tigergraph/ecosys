In 2003 a young singer named Jodie Connor appeared as a contestant on the second series of the hit British television show Pop Idol .
She made it to the final fifty of the competition , earning her the chance to perform live to the nation , but failed to finish in the top two in her group and was finally eliminated in the wildcard round.Connor returned to the public eye in 2010 when her vocals were featured on the bridge and chorus of Roll Deep 's UK chart-topping single `` Roll Deep , '' as well as co-writing the song .
She later featured on Roll Deep member Wiley 's solo track `` Electric Boogaloo -LRB- Find A Way -RRB- '' and appeared in the music video for Tinchy Stryder 's Top 10 hit `` In My System . ''
After this breakthrough , Connor signed with Polydor and released this song as her debut single , on which Wiley returns the favor by contributing a guest rap of his own .
Connor told CMU about her songwriting process : `` My producer Dawood will usually come up with the production or an idea , and we will sing different melodies over it .
Then I usually think of a concept , visualize a video and start to pen the lyrics . ''
