This dramatic waltz is a track from Wreckorder , the debut solo album by Fran Healy , who is the lead singer of the Scottish band Travis .
The song features one Paul McCartney on bass .
Healy explained on his blog at FranHealy.com that as a way of thanking McCartney , he became a vegetarian .
Said Healy : `` One of the biggest coups was getting Paul McCartney to play bass on a song .
I 'm not sure what non McCartney songs he 's played bass on but I could n't think of many .
Anyways his bassline is brilliant .
-LRB- Healy 's wife -RRB- Nora and I were sitting and were thinking of a thank you present and I suggested going vegetarian .
Our son is already one so it would mean we would all on the same boat .
I met Paul at his show in Berlin and told him what we wanted to do .
He was visibly flabbergasted .
Three days later the Fed Ex man delivered three Linda McCartney cook books . ''
Healy explained to Spin magazine how he ended up getting by with a little help from McCartney : `` I wrote this song called As It Comes , and the refrain reminded me of The Beatles .
I thought , ` Why do n't I get in touch with him ? '
I know Paul .
We met in 2000 on holiday -- we were staying in the same place .
Anyway , I thought I should ask , because if I did n't , I 'd always wonder if he would have done it .
So I sent it to him last July and he did it .
People always ask him to sing on their albums , but I do n't think he 's ever played bass on anyone else 's album before . ''
