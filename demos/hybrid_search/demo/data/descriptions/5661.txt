This is a song from The Light the Dead See , the fourth full-length studio album from British electronica production duo Soulsavers .
The record is a collaboration with Depeche Mode frontman Dave Gahan , who sang on every track .
Working long distance , via email , Gahan also put words to Soulsaver 's music .
`` I honestly wrote what came naturally into my head , '' the Depeche Mode singer told Spinner .
`` It 's weird - the gospel aspect of it really spoke to me somehow .
I do n't know if that was my upbringing , being forced to go to church .
The only part I enjoyed about that , by the way , was singing .
I enjoyed singing in the church .
I always enjoyed performing , and the imagery as well .
I liked all the icons and stuff like that .
But most of the Catholicism basically terrified me , to be quite honest . ''
