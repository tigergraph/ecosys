This is a track from Enslaved , the eighth studio album by the Metal band Soulfly .
It was recorded in late 2011 in Tallcat Studios in Phoenix , Arizona and produced by frontman Max Cavalera along with Zeuss .
The record was released March 13 , 2012 .
The album has a concept of slavery .
Speaking with Noisecreep , Cavalera explained why : `` I actually first had the idea 15 years ago and it seemed like a powerful Metal concept .
What has happened to people over the years , the brutal behavior that has been thrust upon people , it involves just so much pain and struggle .
I remember reading a poem in an old book , a cry for justice from someone being owned and abused , a slave , and my mind just took off from there .
I want people to pay attention to the lower tunings on this new album -- the tone and the feeling of those tunings really lends to this concept . ''
