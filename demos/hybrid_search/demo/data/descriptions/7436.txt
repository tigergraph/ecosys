Instrumentalist Maxwell Drummey told Complex Magazine how this track was inspired by a tune in Outkast 's 2006 musical film Idlewild .
He explained : `` We saw the Idlewild trailer and heard the song ` PJ and Rooster , ' and we were like that song is awesome and we should make some s -- t that 's on that vibe .
`` Vocalist D.A. Wallach added : `` I was obsessed with the lyric when -LSB- Andre 3000 -RSB- says , ' I had a lot of time on my hands .
Now I got ta lot of hands on my time , and everybody wan na be a friend of mine . '
Then you have the piano going there and it sounds sick as f -- k. I wish that whole album had all been like that song because I was like , ` Oh , s -- t they 're gon na make a Country album that sounds like it 's in space ! '
and they did n't . ''
This was titled after Neal Pogue , who mixed Love The Future .
Pogue told Drummey and Wallach that the album was cool but lacked hit songs .
So the duo penned this number and `` She Loves Everybody . ''
