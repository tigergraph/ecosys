Hendrix was working intermittently on a new album , tentatively titled First Ray Of The New Rising Sun -LRB- finally released in 1997 -RRB- , when he died in London on September 18 , 1970 from `` drug-related complications . ''
Many of the songs probably would n't have made the actual release if Hendrix had lived .
There are around 4 guitar tracks .
The backwards solo and fills , 2 guitar effect -LRB- univibe -RRB- and one last guitar with no special effect .
The univibe was probably Hendrix ' favorite effect .
A Similar sound was created with a Leslie speaker used in `` Little Wing . ''
An alternative mix recorded July 23 , 1970 starts out with Jimi saying , `` Let me do some sea sounds . ''
Hendrix wrote this as a tribute to R&B legend Curtis Mayfield , who played with Jimi early in his career .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- According to Hendrix ' producer Eddie Kramer , Jimi had the uncanny ability to record a solo backwards , all the while knowing exactly how it would sound after the tape was flipped back over .
Buzzy Linhart played a vibraphone on this , which was added after Hendrix ' death .
-LRB- thanks , gonzalo - BsAs , Argentina , for all above -RRB-
