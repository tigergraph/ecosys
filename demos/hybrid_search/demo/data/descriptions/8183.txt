The Civil Wars duo of Joy Williams and John Paul White wrote this slice of fulsome Blues Rock one week before their debut album , Barton Hollow , came out .
They penned it in the mountains of Salt Lake City during the duo 's first Sundance Festival .
Williams explained : `` We conjured up a story about a woman who was married to a philandering man .
She is begging her man to level with her , and letting him know she can only take so much , a la ` it 's gon na kill me or it 's gon na kill you . ' ''
