Paul McCartney plays bass on this track .
Macca was in Los Angeles for the Grammies and popped over to his Fab Four mate 's home to help out on this song .
He ended up duetting with Ringo on another track , `` Walk With You . ''
McCartney 's previous appearance on a Starr album was over a decade previously , on 1998 's Vertical Man .
In this song Starr sings of the inspiration he drew from John Lennon 's message of global harmony : `` For me to write that was a normal thing to do , '' he told the Daily Telegraph .
`` I knew the man .
And I really believe that if you , or anyone else , had written it , it would 've been weird .
I was around when he did all that -LSB- Lennon 's anti-Vietnam bed-ins in 1969 -RSB- .
Everybody thinks that the big thing was in Canada , but actually the first one was in Amsterdam .
I also wrote a song for George -LSB- 2003 's Never Without You -RSB- .
So it 's just part of it for me , they 've been my friends for so long . ''
