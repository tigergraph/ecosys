Lead singer Andrew Schwab explained to jesusfreakhideout.com : `` It 's looking at night life culture , dance club culture with a little eighties twist on it - I tried to paint some imagery of the sort of indulgent new wave atmosphere that was twenty years ago that sort of recurred now .
And sort of the emptiness of that - living from the hours of midnight to six AM .
And how , essentially , when the party ends and you 're alone with yourself , how empty life can be when you live for that thing .
The chorus is ` I 've swallowed it all , but I could never be full .
And now they call me a fool for leaving . '
I 've tried all that .
It does n't work . ''
