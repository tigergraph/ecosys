This epic instrumental number is the title track of Manchester based electro pop-rock group Delphic 's debut album .
Produced with the techno émigré Ewan Pearson , Acolyte was recorded mostly in Pearson 's Berlin studio .
Guitarist Matt Cocksedge told The Hounslow Chronicle : `` When we eventually started working with Ewan , it just clicked .
He 'd take things away and I do n't know what he did to them but they 'd just sound loads better .
Often he 'd take things away , the little fiddly bits that we 'd start slapping on when we were sat recording at home .
We 'd get self-indulgent and start adding all these synths and layers -- he taught us that you do n't always need that and sometimes the song can do the work . ''
According to the Songfacts dictionary , an Acolyte is someone in church orders in a minor position .
He or she could be an attendant or assistant or even a faithful follower .
Cocksedge admitted to The Sun January 15 , 2010 that the band are `` passionate about how we want to sound to the point of being control freaks . ''
He added : `` With the title track , it took us 18 months to get it right .
We are so bad at letting go , we 'd probably still be working on it now if we could . ''
