Ross teams up with Gnarls Barkley 's Cee-Lo Green on this soulful track .
The collaboration originated from the two artists running into each other in L.A. Ross told Cee-Lo about a song for which he wanted the Gnarls singer to provide some vocals .
The Miami rapper sent the song off , and it was completed in a fortnight .
`` He had verses on it already , '' Cee-Lo told MTV News .
`` But -LSB- the words -RSB- ` Tears of Joy ' is all I needed .
Ross did Ross , which is great .
-LSB- The song -RSB- represents the contrast/contradiction which is life . ''
No I.D. produced the track .
The Chicago beatmaker originally teamed up with J. Cole for the song but the rapper was not able to produce the goods .
`` I could n't have did what Ross did on that , because -LSB- I -RSB- was in a bad place , '' Cole admitted to MTV News .
`` Me and No I.D. was in the studio , but the label was on me about some hits , so it was a bad session .
I squeezed out a verse on ` Tears of Joy , ' but I was not in a good place to do anything close to what Ross did on that . ''
The song opens with a short clip of a speech from Black Panther leader Bobby Seale .
