Ke $ ha 's romantic side comes out on this uptempo love song .
It was inspired by her `` amazing experiences around the world '' during her 2011 Get Sleazy Tour and as the Humane Society 's first global ambassador .
She explained : `` It 's a song about how the love you have to someone will never die , although it 's a big nostalgic , since all things come and go .
You ca n't hang with them forever . ''
This is one of several tunes on Warrior that finds Ke $ ha moving away from the irreverent lyrical content of her debut album in favor of something more sensitive .
She told Reuters : `` There are tracks on this record that are super vulnerable and were hard even to write .
I had to force myself to sit down and write these songs . ''
