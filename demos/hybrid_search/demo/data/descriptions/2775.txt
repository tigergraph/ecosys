In a 2006 interview with Kerrang !
magazine , Tom DeLonge -LRB- Blink-182 , Box Car Racer -RRB- said of this song : `` This is the last song on the album .
I always take my daughter to this ice-cream place .
Next door is a toy shop and they had a pink toy piano in there .
It sounded so good , so I bought it .
The very next day I put it in the shower and played that part .
I pictured being on a boat and as you 're leaving a city in flames , you see a tropical island , like you 're going to a beautiful place .
I make references to my past in this song - ' I left the chill and voice of screams and kids and ran for shelter . '
In leaving the desolation and negativity behind , you find something beautiful . ''
-LRB- thanks , Todd - Blackwood , NJ -RRB-
