On occasion , when playing this song live , lead singer Bradley Nowell would sing : `` Lord knows I 'm weak , wo n't somebody get me off of this tweek ? ''
which implies that the song is about trying to kick addiction , with the `` Big , blue whale '' being the drug , thus : `` I swim , but I wish I 'd never learned . ''
Nowell died of a heroin overdose in 1996 .
