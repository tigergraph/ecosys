The Horrors are an alternative rock band from Southend On Sea in England .
They comprise vocalist Faris Badwan , guitarist Joshua Hayward , synthesizer player Tom Cowan , bassist Rhys Webb and drummer Joseph Spurgeon .
This is the opening track from their third album Skying and was the last song written for the record .
Tom Cowan told NME : `` This was a little bit of a Frankenstein track as we had two songs that were n't really working .
Luckily Rhys saw a connection and we managed to cull the best from both and fuse them together . ''
Skying was released on July 11th 2011 on XL recordings and recorded by the band in their own London studio built by Joshua Hayward .
The guitarist also constructed a 20 stage phaser whose whoosing effect can be heard on this song .
The album title makes reference to the Grande-Skyer Mark II phaser used on Calbeb Quaye 's 1967 number , `` Baby Your Phrasing is Bad . ''
