This was the first single by American rapper Trick Daddy from his sixth studio album Thug Matrimony : Married to the Streets .
It featured Twista and Lil Jon and became Trick Daddy 's most successful single to date , peaking at # 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 .
Jim Jonsin and Lil Jon were the knobmeisters for this joint .
Florida native Jonsin has helmed several of the 21st century 's biggest hip hop and R&B hits including `` Whatever You Like '' by T.I. , `` Lollipop '' by Lil Wayne , and `` Just a Dream '' by Nelly .
However in an interview with his local newspaper Broward Palm Beach New Times Jonsin explained this is his favorite of all the hit songs he 's produced : `` To flip an Ozzy -LSB- Osbourne -RSB- record , ` Crazy Train ' ... that was one of my favorite rock songs , '' he said .
`` I knew it would do well , although nobody around me thought it would . ''
This song samples the beginning of Ozzy Osbourne 's 1980 hit `` Crazy Train '' repeatedly throughout the song .
