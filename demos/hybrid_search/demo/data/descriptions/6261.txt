Jessie told The Sun about this warm R&B number , which it is rumoured was once earmarked for Alicia Keys : `` One of the first love songs I ever wrote .
I actually recorded it and never wanted anyone to hear it because love is super personal but the song just kept coming back to me and I thought sod it , it 's obviously meant to be heard .
I definitely think it 's a wedding song -- Kate and Will , holla at your girl ! ''
Jessie J told The Daily Telegraph this was written about `` the only person I 've been in love with . ''
She added : '' ` We 're very close still and , you know , they 're one of my best mates .
They 're very close to me still and if one day I feel like I 've got more time ... '' She trailed off before saying , `` That 's not the last song I 'll write about that person . ''
The bisexual singer admitted in the record 's track-by-track video that she wanted to keep the song from the world , as its about falling in love with a girlfriend .
