In this song , Madonna is comparing rain with the feelings of love .
Just as the rain washes away the dirt , love washes clean the sorrows of the past , leaving just you and your lover in that moment of time .
Madonna wrote the song with her frequent early '90s collaborator Shep Pettibone , who also worked with her on `` Vogue '' and `` This Used To Be My Playground . ''
The video was directed by Mark Romanek , who later did the Johnny Cash video for `` Hurt '' and the Robin Williams movie One Hour Photo .
The video won for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography at the MTV Video Music Awards .
Publicity materials for the album said that this song was a tribute to Karen Carpenter , possibly because of the way Madonna sings it .
Madonna said of the singer : `` Karen Carpenter had the clearest , purest voice .
I 'm completely influenced by her harmonic sensibility . ''
