Like the other tracks on American Slang , this song about a rich girl growing up in New York who finds redemption in music draws on frontman and songwriter Brian Fallon 's own life .
He told Gibson.com : `` I do n't usually write songs about being in a band .
I do n't think people would find that very interesting .
This record has to do with me as a person .
I 've been chasing this dream of being a musician all my life with everything inside me .
I never really dealt with myself and what I felt and what had happened to me all my life .
I was moving so fast I ignored a lot of feelings and buried them way down .
This record 's about personal things . ''
