This tender piano ballad is the title track from an album by Black Francis , who also records under the name of Frank Black .
When the erstwhile Pixies frontman announced that his new solo album would be called NONSTOPEROTIK many assumed the album is all about getting physical .
But Francis told Spinner UK things are n't that simple .
`` I find that too literal , '' he said .
`` Sexuality obviously can be complicated .
I did n't only write songs about bumping and grinding , you know what I mean ?
I did the art thing and mixed in some death , redemption , some lust and some romance and love , some sexual abstraction . ''
