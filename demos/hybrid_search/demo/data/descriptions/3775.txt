The second single from English recording artist Victoria Hesketh , aka Little Boots ' , sophomore album finds her following Dionne and Aretha 's blueprint for love .
However , rather than saying a solitary little prayer for her beau before putting on her make up and all through her coffee break time , Hesketh differs in that she does at night and there 's nothing ` little ' about it .

Hesketh wrote the song with New York based DJ Andy Butler , who also fronts up the Nu-disco project , Hercules and Love Affair .
