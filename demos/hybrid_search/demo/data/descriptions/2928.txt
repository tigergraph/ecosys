This is the only track on Young The Giant that dates back to when the band was known as The Jakes .
It was composed when the band was unsigned and originally appeared on their 2008 Shake My Hand EP .
The song was sung by Blaine Anderson on the third mid-season finale of Glee .
Blaine 's performance is intercut with scenes of the gay character David Karofsky struggling with hate threats on his social media pages leading up to an attempted suicide .
The members of Young the Giant did have to think a bit about whether to grant permission for the series to use their song , but were eventually pleased with its placement in such a poignant scene .
`` I do n't think we ever had the intent of the song ... in such a serious scene , '' Gadhia told Billboard magazine : `` It 's very , very intense , very , very impactful , and we most definitely empathized with that .
All of us have been victims of bullying - and been bullies at some point in time .
It 's something that hits everyone . ''
The song was written as a cry for help when the band was broke and did n't know what to do with themselves .
Frontman Sameer Gadhia explained the group , `` felt somewhat oppressed by the universal expectation of what to do in Orange County ... in suburbia in general .
I think we really yearned to break out of that and do something a little bit different . ''
Gadhia added that the song was their attempt to `` break free , not necessarily from oppression , but the common symptoms of suburbia like boredom , normality and homogeneity . ''
