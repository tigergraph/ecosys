This is a tribute song , not necessarily to one particular guitarist , although one of Sambora 's heroes played on it .
According to musicologist Carol Brennan : ` Before making ... Stranger in This Town , Sambora had the good fortune to meet one of his idols , Eric Clapton .
Sambora had once been the presenter at a music-awards show and met him then , and later was invited to sit in on a live session with Clapton , Lou Reed , Buddy Guy , and Bo Diddley .
When Sambora was in the process of making -LSB- the album -RSB- , he sent Clapton a note asking him if he was interested in helping out on a track .
To his surprise , Clapton was happy to guest on `` Mr. Bluesman , '' a song Sambora wrote about his guitar heroes such as Clapton and Robert Johnson .
` This laid back song is another fine track on this vastly under-rated album , and will be appreciated by music fans from a far wider spectrum than blues aficionados .
