Flogging Molly singer Dave King was raised in a small apartment in Beggars Bush , Dublin .
He left Ireland in his twenties , briefly resided in London before moving to Los Angeles where he formed Flogging Molly .
After marrying the band 's fiddler Bridget Regan , he moved to Detroit where he wrote the majority of the band 's fifth studio album Speed Of Darkness .
This song was inspired by the different places he 's lived .
King explained to Alternative Press magazine : `` I used Detroit as the epicenter for the song , but it 's really to do with so many places , including Ireland .
With the Irish people and the people of Detroit , there 's a lot of humor .
There 's a lot of humor in that song if you really listen to it , a lot of sarcasm -- ` I 'm from Detroit , where my job is secure/Secure in the fact that it 's gone for good .
` When I was growing up in Ireland , 1975-76 , it was the worst of times .
It was pretty bad .
But I always remember the people 's sense of humor .
We 'd all sit around and individually sing a song .
We had no money , but , we knew fun . ''
King previously sung about the area where he grew up on the Swagger track , `` The Ol' Beggars Bush . ''
The song finds King singing about the savings being gone and the power 's out .
He told Alternative Press : `` That was from my own experience as a child .
We had no money .
We had one room in the house - it was an -LSB- apartment -RSB- .
We could n't afford to pay the electricity bill .
And the electricity would be turned off .
And that happened a few times as a child .
So I applied that to the current day . ''
