This song was penned by vocalist Jack Steadman about breaking up with his girlfriend .
He told NME : `` When I went to Atlanta to work with -LRB- producer -RRB- Ben Allen , we put it on a loop .
He said , ` I 'm off for five minutes .
When I come back I want you to have written something .
That became the chorus . ''
