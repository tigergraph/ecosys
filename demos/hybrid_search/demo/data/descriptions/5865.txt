Guitarist Anand Wilder told MTV News : `` It was a kind of quiet , folky , acoustic lullaby that I worked on .
I think I stole a lyric out of , like , a Celtic book of verse for the first line and kind of went from there .
I kind of wanted to write a song in the vein of ` Jealous Guy ' by John Lennon , a song about being a weak man , a gambler or something like that .
So we had that basic structure for the opening , and then Chris -LSB- Keating , vocals and keyboards -RSB- had the idea to drop this really heavy beat on top of it .
And it completely changed the feel of the song . ''
The song 's music video stars Forgetting Sarah Marshall 's Kristen Bell as the owner of an unconventional pet .
Wilder recalled to Drowned in Sound : '' ` Madder Red ' was a folky kind of jam that Ira -LSB- Wolf Tuton , bass -RSB- had sent to me , and I wrote all the lyrics and the melody .
I think I took a line from this book of Celtic verse that I had , which was ` even when my luck is down ... ' it 's a Kenny Rodgers/Glenn Campbell type of song , just the idea of being on the road , not living a normal 9 to 5 lifestyle and following your passion and that means you 're away from your loved ones for long periods of time .
It 's a song of resignation , really , but then we threw a massive industrial sounding beat over it , which created a very interesting juxtaposition with the sweet sounding vocal . ''
