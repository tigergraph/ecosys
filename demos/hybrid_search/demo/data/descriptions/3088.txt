Although this has very few words , it is still a meaningful song .
Humans need things to be explainable , they have to understand it .
`` Watch the weather change , '' is the action , the beginning .
`` Mention this to me , mention something , mention anything , '' is begging for someone or something to explain the weather changing , but after he finishes , the `` weather changes '' again , so he asks again `` mention this to me '' but again it changes .
The meaning of this song is that things happen , explaining how or why these things happen does n't matter .
What matters is that we embrace what ever bewilders us , because in the end it will always change .
