This features Kim Deal singing in German .
Deal explained to Pitchfork Media why : `` I 'm in the four-track , and I 've got this simple riff -LSB- sings riff -RSB- on my guitar , and of course , now I got ta grab the microphone .
I think it sounds cool , so I 've got to sing something over it .
I know that I want to sing German on top of it .
It 's just going to sound cooler .
So I figured out the words that I would like to sing , and I knew that I wanted this silly , kind of simple riff that 's kind of middling .
It has no high frequency or low .
It 's just this taut , tense thing that continues on , relentless !
-LSB- Sings riff -RSB- I knew that that would be a cool place to put Wagnerian harmonies of me and Kelley , these harmonies in German that go -LSB- sings gibberish German -RSB- whatever , and I knew that I wanted to stop in the song so that I could say `` und so weiter . ''
Deal added in an interview with Mojo magazine January 2008 : `` I wrote this cool punk riff , and it just needed to be sung in German .
But I do n't speak any German so Kelley and I found this German teacher called Elsa to help us with the lyrics . ''
Deal added laughing : '' -LRB- Producer -RRB- Steve Albini 's fianc√©e Heather says it could be our biggest song , if we did n't sing it in German ! ''
