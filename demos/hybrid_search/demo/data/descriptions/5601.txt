Ritter explained to Express Night Out : `` It 's about a ship captain who is a traveler and leaves to find a world beyond the ice of the North Pole .
And he never finds it .
It 's more about his obsession and love affair with his ship . ''
The running time of this epic tune is 7:34 and its large not only in length , but also in musical content .
Ritter told Express Night Out : `` One of the things with this whole record is I wanted to make sure that I put longer songs on there because I thought they would come to define the record .
-LRB- The song -RRB- has everything from vibraphones , to violin , and pianos and French horns .
It 's huge . ''
