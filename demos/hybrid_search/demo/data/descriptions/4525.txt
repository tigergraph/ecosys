This is the second single to be released from English alternative rock band Morning parade 's self-titled debut solo album .
Vocalist/guitarist Steve Sparrow explained the song 's meaning to Spinner : `` Life is a weird journey and one that I often find quite confusing .
The only constant in the life that I 've experienced is change and the song is about outgrowing yourself and your surroundings , '' he said .
`` We all spend our lives being a million different people at once and its easy to lose yourself along the way , it can also be very lonely yet every single one of us start and end our lives in the same way .
I always thought it was crazy , all of these people alone but sharing the experience . ''
The song 's music video was written and directed by Christian Bevilacqua with some input from the band .
Sparrow explained to Spinner : `` We wanted to show the confusion of the separate journeys being shared by strangers at different stages of their lives .
The ending of the video was inspired by Bernard Rose 's Immortal Beloved , a film about the life of Ludwig Von Beethoven - we wanted to end the video showing everyone meeting and ending their separate journey 's together . ''
