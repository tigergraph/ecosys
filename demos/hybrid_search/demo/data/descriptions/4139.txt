In early 2009 Ryan Adams announced that he was quitting his band the Cardinals and taking a break from music .
The major reason for Adams ' temporary retirement was his struggles with Ménière 's disease , a disorder of the inner ear that wrecks havoc on hearing and balance .
Adams resumed performing in October 2010 , and released his thirteenth studio album , Ashes & Fire , which was produced by Glyn Johns , on October 11 , 2011 .
Adams explores what it is to be kind on this gently strummed soft rock tune .
Longtime friend and collaborator Norah Jones was certainly kind to Adams , lending her vocal , piano and songwriting talents to three of the 11 tracks on Ashes & Fire , including this one .
She described the recording process to Billboard : `` It had been a long time since Ryan was in the studio , '' she said , `` which is a big deal for him , because he 's made so many records .
This was the first period where he has really not done that for a few years .
I could tell he was really excited .
Especially working with Glyn , who 's like our uncle , -LSB- saying things -RSB- like , ` Come on , kids , get to work , ' in his stern voice -LSB- while at the same time -RSB- telling a dirty joke . ''
