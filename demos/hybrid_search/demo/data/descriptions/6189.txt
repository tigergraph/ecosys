After Micheal Schenker left the Scorpions for UFO and Uli Roth took control of the lead guitar in The Scorpions , they reunited for this one song , which they wrote together .
The original version has an acoustic intro , but the Scorpions never played it live , possibly because it needs more the 2 guitarists .
