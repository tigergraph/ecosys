Bruce explained the story behind the song to The Nottingham Post : `` It 's just a heartbreak song , '' she said .
`` You want to be independent but then someone comes along .
You think they 're going to help you and you can battle the world together .
Then , when they leave it 's like ` what on earth ... I did n't even want to do this in the first place .
I can do this on my own . ' ''
