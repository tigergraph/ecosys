This song finds Matt Berninger lamenting a Southern city he hates .
Guitarist Aaron Dessner had rearranged the chords from one of his favourite Dylan songs , Time Out Of Mind 's `` Not Dark Yet , '' and felt , the song had become the one he 'd always wanted the band to write .
`` This lugubrious , swampy ballad that Matt 's voice would dominate , and just feel timeless , '' he explained to The Guardian .
`` It 's not that the song is God 's gift to songwriting or anything , '' he added apologetically .
`` But it felt to me something that I 'd always hoped we could do . ''
