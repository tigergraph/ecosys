Jason Aldean 's producer Michael Knox was enthusiastic about this Neil Thrasher and Wendell Mobley penned power ballad as soon as he heard the demo , but the singer was slightly less so .
Aldean recalled to Billboard magazine : `` Knox called me and said , ' I found a monster .
I listened to it and I loved the song , but it was one of those songs that I liked a lot , but Michael was infatuated with this song .
I was going back and forth between that and ` Staring at the Sun , ' which is one of my favorites on the record .
`` He added : `` So I was like , if I got ta pick between the two I 'm goin ' with Staring at the Sun . '
And I actually fell I love with the song after we cut it .
Now all of a sudden I got a chance to hear my version of it , and it went from ' I like it a lot ' to loving it , and I would 've been kickin ' myself if it was n't on the record .
That one was Michael 's baby for sure .
There have been songs that I loved and we cut 'em and I do n't like the way I did it , and this was the opposite of that . ''
