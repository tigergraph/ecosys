Portobello Road in the Notting Hill area of London is the home of a famous street market .
Several early Dire Straits songs were inspired by Mark Knopfler 's then recent move to and wanderings about the capital .
Described as an Irish reggae number and running to 4 minutes 29 seconds , `` Portobello Belle '' sees him continuing where he left off with the last two tracks on the group 's debut album , `` Wild West End '' and `` Lions , '' exploring the streets of his adopted home , as ever with an eye on the ladies .
