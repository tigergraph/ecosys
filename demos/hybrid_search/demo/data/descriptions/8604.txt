The opening track of I Am Kloot 's sixth album , Let It All In , contains lines full of self-disgust .
`` You treat your mind like a cheap hotel , Somewhere you could stay but never stop , '' sings John Bramwell .
The vocalist/guitarist commented to The Independent : `` Freud would probably have a field day ; when you talk to someone in a song and you accuse them of things , it 's you , is n't it ? ''
Bramwell explained the track 's mood to The Sun : `` I 'm in a pretty isolated and neurotic place in parts of this song but you can feel a gentle optimism and philosophy breaking through in other parts , '' he said .
`` I would think that combination of what would appear to be contradictory emotions and thoughts plays a big part in what I hope is the appeal of I Am Kloot . ''
