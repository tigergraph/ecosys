This is a track from Nelly Furtado 's fourth English-language studio album , Spirit Indestructible , on which one of the themes is nostalgia .
Said the singer : `` All my old memories suddenly became crystal clear to me , and I found myself re-visiting my past in a fresh and colourful way , on songs such as ` Parking Lot , ' produced by Rodney `` Darkchild '' Jerkins , where I detail good times in my hometown , sort of like my own take on ` Summer of ' 69 . ' ''
The song 's music video was directed by Ray Kay and shot in Los Angeles .
It sees Furtado performing the track at night in a parking lot full of custom-designed Mini Coopers , while joined by a gang of backing dancers .
