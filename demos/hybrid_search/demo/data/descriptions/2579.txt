This song is about relationships and the dynamics of compromise between two people .
When we spoke with Our Lady Peace lead singer Raine Maida in 2012 , he explained by saying , `` There 's a give and take in a relationship and I think at the end of the day , you can only go as far in a relationship as the other person allows you to .
You ca n't force something .
You ca n't demand things of a person that they 're not willing to give up .
I would hate for people to think it 's a negative way to look at it ; it 's really not meant to be that .
It 's just supposed to be more of an honest coming to terms with how relationships really function when you break them down . ''
With 2012 's Curve , Our Lady Peace wanted to experiment with their sound more than ever before .
Their guitarist Steve Mazur told us that this song is `` a very different vibe for us '' and that it `` feels very fresh '' for OLP .
