The Welsh rock band Funeral for a Friend 's fifth studio album was named after this track .
Explaining the album 's title , vocalist Matt Davies-Kreye told CMU : `` A friend of mine was mentioning how he felt that the best thing for the planet was for the human race to just drop dead and at times I can see and understand his way of thinking but a big part of me has this -LRB- probably -RRB- misguided faith in humanity to kind of steer the ship in the right direction for a change .
So Welcome Home Armageddon is the idea of patiently waiting for the end to arrive at your doorstep and give you a nice big hug . ''
Drummer Ryan Richards told Rock Sound magazine about this song : `` Like ` Sixteen ' this was one that Matt brought as an acoustic skeleton , it also changed a lot but kept the melody that attracted us all to the idea in the first place .
As an album closer , it was always the clear choice - both for vibe and melodic content . ''
