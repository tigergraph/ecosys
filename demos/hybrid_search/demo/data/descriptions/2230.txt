This song is about facing the evil in the world and confronting the existence of God .
Lead singer Dan Haseltine said in Christian Music Today that the phrase `` Oh My God '' means `` so many different things and it 's used in so many different contexts , but in the end , it means that at some point in every person 's life , they have to confront whether or not God is real . ''
