In our interview , guitarist Ben Savage explained that Whitechapel songs are usually developed from riffs the band has been working on , with the lyrics only being written at the end .
`` This is Exile '' reflects this with prominently mixed guitars and a strong focus on melodic elements .
The song shares its name with the album it appears on .
Speaking to Run Far Off , the group 's guitarist Alex Wade said that the band set out writing the record as a concept album to `` make things a little more interesting for the fans and even for us writing it . ''
It revolves around the concept of an evil god that is sent to destroy earth .
Each song is part of an overarching story .
It also features in the iOs rhythm game , Tap Tap Revenge 3 .
The lyrics offer the listener an inside glimpse of the existence of the hypothetical evil entities that are sent to destroy earth .
It hints that anger at their isolation partially motivates this attack -LRB- `` This is exile , we are the walking scum '' -RRB- while still making sure that they 're established as evil -LRB- `` The world is ours and you 're totally f -- king dead '' -RRB- .
As part of a larger narrative told across the album , this song serves to add some nuance to the story by providing us with a somewhat sympathetic view of the beings that otherwise function as the primary villain .
The song appears as downloadable content for the videogames Rockband 1,2 , and 3 .
