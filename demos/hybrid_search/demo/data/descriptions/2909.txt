While touring to promote her sophomore album Breakthrough , Caillat realized she 'd developed feelings for her guitarist and musical director Justin Young .
This autobiographical song , which she penned with frequent collaborators Rick Nowels and Jason Reeves , finds her singing about the possibility that she was falling in love with her bandmate .
Caillat told Billboard magazine : `` He was the guy who warms me up and talks with the band , so we had to work together more than we ever had .
And all of a sudden I noticed I would change my outfit a few times before I would rehearse with him , and I would get butterflies when he would walk on the tour bus or when he 'd talk to me or anything like that .
We eventually talked about it , and then we started dating . ''
The tune also features on the Soundtrack for the 2010 American romantic comedy drama film , Letters To Juliet .
