On Hidden , British art rock band These New Puritans used six-foot Japanese taiko drums to create its deep percussion sounds .
However , the thundering percussion-led noise was too much for one headmaster , who banned his school choir from contributing to this song as he judged the music to be `` too dark . ''
Frontman Jack Barnett explained to NME January 16 , 2010 : `` I think he objected to the implication of violence - the title ` Attack Music . '
But they were a fairly professional choir who get asked to do a lot of work .
The second lot were from a state school in Hackney .
They were more enthusiastic about the whole idea . ''
Hidden was voted 2010 Album of the Year by the NME .
The sound of knives being sharpened can be heard on this track .
On Hidden Barnett experimented with a diverse array of recording tricks including the use of `` Foley techniques . ''
He explained to NME : `` It 's the method they use in film to develop sound effects .
Like , for instance , cracking a cauliflower at the stem simulates the sound of human bone breaking . ''
