A Zephyr is a light gust of warm wind .
Anthony Kiedis ' lyrics conjure images of courting a beautiful girl and asking her to `` fly away '' with him to be forever happy .
One of his past girlfriends would take coke with him , so the song may be about him trying to get her to feel this euphoria with him , as he loves her so much he wants her to understand .
