This song came out really quickly in the recording process for Hummingbird .
Drummer Matt Frazier explained to Q magazine : `` We went out to Joshua Tree for a week during the writing process and rented this weird dome house .
Two songs came out of it and that was one of them .
It came together in a couple of hours .
I feel like it 's really different for us and an important part of the record . ''
