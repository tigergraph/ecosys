Two Suns tells the story of two lovers .
In this cosmic call to arms , which according to promotional materials , `` conveys the struggle to experience connectedness , '' we see how they come together and pull apart like two planets .
The theme of duality , two planets , two lovers , two sides of a personality , is a recurring theme throughout the album .
Part of the inspiration for this song and the rest of Two Suns came from a relationship that ended as Khan finished writing the songs for the album .
Most of them were penned in her room in Brighton , England , in her bed , but this and `` Glass '' were written in New York .
Khan explained to The Sun April 10 , 2009 : `` My boyfriend was in New York and this album reflects the whole cycle of that relationship as well as the traveling back and forth . ''
She added : `` The Two Suns are like me and him .
You meet someone and you have this amazing exchange .
It was n't necessarily a quantity but a quality sort of experience with all sorts of highs and lows .
It changed me for ever . ''
Jazz musician Herbie Hancock 's early work with synthesizers and Australian post punk band Dead Can Dance were inspirations for this experimental track .
