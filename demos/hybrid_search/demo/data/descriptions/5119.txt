In the Belly of the Brazen Bull is The Cribs ' fifth studio album .
Recorded at Tarbox Road in New York , London 's Abbey Road , and Chicago 's Electrical Audio with producers Dave Fridmann and Steve Albini finds them returning to their roots , and certainly this song resembles their early material .
Said guitarist Ryan Jarman to NME : `` People who go into it with the attitude that it 's ` back to basics ' are going to find a record that 's a lot more stripped back , it was all recorded live and we did n't do as many overdubs .
Sonically it 's a lot fiercer record , Dave Friddman and Steve Albini are both quite uncompromising producers . ''
