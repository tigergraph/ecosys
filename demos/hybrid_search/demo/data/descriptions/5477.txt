A full day was spent smashing panes of glass for this song .
Frontman Jack Barnett told NME : `` We went to a glaziers near our studio and they gave us safety glass , because we wanted tiny little fragments , this detailed sound .
You know , you could go to some sample library and get the sound of breaking glass .
But that 's boring and it sounds s -- t. '' Asked by NME if the glass-smashing actually signified something , Barnett replied : `` It was obvious to me at one moment that it needed a pane of glass being smashed .
It 's all in the service of the music .
These days , if people like anything it 's got to be ironic or retro or clever .
I could n't care less about that .
I just want to make music from the heart that I can believe in .
And , in this instance , the glass -- it just communicated what I wanted to say . ''
