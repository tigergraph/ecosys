The song title refers to the volcano that laid waste to the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in AD 79 .
The track is filled with metaphors of pagan and religious origin as Stevens calls on the volcano , the `` fire of fire , '' to `` fall on me now as I favor the ghost . ''
Many of Stevens ' songs have spiritual allusions and the Detroit born singer-songwriter consistently uses the word `` ghost '' to refer to the Holy Spirit in his music .
On this track it appears he is using Vesuvius as a symbol for the ultimate fire , which is God , so it can be interpreted that he is singing about the Christian 's lifetime struggle of choosing to following the Spirit of God which resides inside , or giving in to the desires of the flesh , which leads to death .
Stevens said of this song in concert at the Chicago Theater on October 15 , 2010 : `` Standing at the edge of a volcano , pondering death is n't a very healthy way to live . ''
