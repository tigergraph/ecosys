Vocalist Rou Reynolds explained this angry number to Kerrang !
: `` Tyrannosaurus refers to the tyrants we see in society today , and the ` tyrannised ' is the people fighting back .
It 's one again about us trying to get the point across that we 're all connected . ''
Bassist Chris Batten expanded on the bombastic track to Noisecreep : `` That one is one of the heaviest songs on the album .
It 's basically about all good things come to an end , meaning large corporations .
Anything that goes so high has to fall , is the meaning behind that one . ''
