Josh Ritter wrote The Beast in Its Tracks in the wake of his divorce from American singer-songwriter Dawn Landes .
This heartbreaking cut finds him singing about finding a new woman while simultaneously wondering if his ex wife has also moved on with a new man .
`` The writing of ` New Lover ' just happened , '' Ritter told Spinner .
`` As it sometimes occurs -LRB- though rarely -RRB- , I got lucky and the tangled ball of emotions unrolled itself almost effortlessly into a song .
As ever , I wanted to make sure that the personal never precluded the ability of someone else to relate to the song , but thankfully , the song 's personality needed no altering .
I 'm super proud of it , but I almost feel as if I ca n't take credit for it . ''
MSN asked Ritter if there are any songs he is unable to sing following his divorce from Dawn Landes ?
He replied : `` You sing songs , or you have favourite songs your whole life .
Then something happens to you that closely relates or mimics the experience of the song .
You realize it 's just been a loaded gun the whole time .
For me like ` Alexandra Leaving ' or ` Famous Blue Raincoat ' , two great Leonard Cohen songs , I never realized how desolating songs those were until I had an experience that made those things seem like he was so close to the bone .
They were also painful to listen to .
There are those songs .
Then there are details of a relationship , which I could never sing because they are too painful .
They 're pedestrian and silly .
Some of them are great memories .
Some of them are bad .
They all have a sting to them now . ''
Ritter told MSN that this was `` one of the very first songs that I wrote for the record . ''
He added : `` It felt like I was coming out of this whole thing .
It was really early days .
I thought that I was totally moving on .
You hope for something , but then you also want to take it back .
There can never be total forgiveness in that way . ''
