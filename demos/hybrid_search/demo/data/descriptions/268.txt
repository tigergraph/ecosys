This was inspired by an Indian tune Jimmy Page and Robert Plant heard while traveling in Bombay .
When they returned home and recorded the track , the band was so ecstatic with the result that they ran out on to the lawn of their Stargroves studio and danced to it , which gave them the idea for the title and lyrical content .
-LRB- thanks , Tim - Milton , Canada -RRB- If you listen closely , you can hear John Bonham 's drum pedal squeaking .
The song is about summer .
It 's very light and relaxed for Zeppelin .
The Stone Temple Pilots covered this on the 1995 Encomium : A Tribute to Led Zeppelin album .
