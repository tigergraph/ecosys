This is a `` Power of Equality '' social commentary song .
It refers to social ills such as war -LRB- `` War and Peace / The Killing fist / Of the human beast '' -RRB- , the death of the planet -LRB- `` Holy mother Earth / crying into space / Tears on her pretty face / For she has been raped '' -RRB- , Abortion and genocide .
Perhaps a little piously , Anthony Kiedis ends his gloomy lament on a positive note , asking a hero for help -LRB- `` Marvin Gaye My love / Where did we go wrong '' -RRB- , and pleading for better times ahead : `` Hear me when I 'm calling you / From my knees / I am playing for a better day . ''
-LRB- thanks , Benjamin - Ã…lesund , Norway -RRB-
