This song was written in a Ska/Dub style similar to that of Operation Ivy , the band Rancid lead singer Tim Armstrong and bassist Matt Freeman played with in the late '80s .
The lyrics in the first verse were taken from another Rancid song called `` Motorcycle Ride '' from their 1994 album Let 's Go .
The song is a classic case of lyrical dissonance , describing a kid who lives a life of crime -LRB- probably a drug runner -RRB- and is killed by a rival in the end .
The video for `` Time Bomb '' was directed by Marcus Raboy , who 's also directed clips for several mainstream artists such as Shakira , Luther Vandross , The Dixie Chicks , and Santana .
Raboy has also directed rapper Ice Cube in two movies : Friday After Next -LRB- 2002 -RRB- and The Janky Promoters -LRB- 2009 -RRB- .
This was featured in an episode of Gilmore Girls in 2000 .
The song also appeared in the 2005 Jim Carrey movie Fun with Dick and Jane .
The organ solo was performed by Vic Ruggiero from New York City Ska band The Slackers .
The Slackers are signed to Rancid lead singer Tim Armstrong 's Hellcat Records label .
UFC fighter Antonio Banuelos uses this song as his entrance music .
