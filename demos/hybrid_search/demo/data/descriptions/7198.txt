This fast-paced , hard-driving track finds FFDP frontman Ivan Moody unleashing his fury .
The vocalist recalled : `` When I started writing the lyrics I was so fed up .
We were about halfway through the album and we had whole bunches of stuff still to do and the stress level just got me and this was just one of those lashings where you rip open your chest and let the monster come out . ''
