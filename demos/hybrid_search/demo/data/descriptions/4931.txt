This song finds Joey Belladonna singing about democracy in the United States and around the world .
According to guitarist Scott Ian , the song is `` very much about people taking the power back . ''
Musically , this is one of a number of fast-paced songs on the Worship Music album .
Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante told us : `` It was funny , because we were just in that frame of mind .
It was n't a song that we were forcing ourselves to write .
It 's just these are the riffs that were coming out and these are the ideas that I had .
And I was just in that mode - I wanted to thrash again . ''
