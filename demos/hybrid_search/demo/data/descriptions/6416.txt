In an interview with The Sun March 13 , 2008 , vocalist Alison Mosshart was asked whether the acoustic guitar and piano on this track suggested a different approach to The Kills ' normal sound .
She replied : `` That 's basically how we write most songs .
A lot of them start with just an acoustic guitar and a vocal .
We have a million tracks that never move on from that .
We kept ` Goodnight Bad Morning ' in its original form ` cos it felt perfect to us .
That was an easy one , an ode to The Velvet Underground .
Why not ? ''
