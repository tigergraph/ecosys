Steel Panther is a Los Angeles based Glam Metal band , who are renowned for their profane and tongue-in-cheek lyrics .
Their lineup consists of vocalist Michael Starr , guitarist Satchel , drummer Stix Zadinia and bassist Lexxi Foxxx .
The quartet began to gain popularity in the Sunset Strip in the early 2000s as Metal Shop and released their debut album Hole Patrol under that name .
In 2008 they changed to Steel Panther and the following year released their major label debut , Feel The Steel .
This ballad is the closing track from the band 's third album Balls Out .
It was produced by Jay Ruston , who previously worked with Steel Panther on Feel The Steel and the LP was released in Europe on October 28 , 2011 and the US three days later .
Stix Zadinia told the story of this song to AntiMusic : '' ` Weenie Ride ' is , at it 's very core , a love song .
Satchel and I were discussing the fact that we did n't have a full blown ballad yet on the record Balls Out .
We talked with Lexxi Foxx in the dressing room about subjects.Love and sex seemed to be the recurring themes .
I believe the first version was ` Weiner Ride ' but we quickly realized that the word , Weiner , was much too juvenile .
Who in their right mind would put a song about wieners on their record !? After weeks of toiling with different words and phrases , ` Weenie Ride ' was born .
Now this was a title we could all wrap our hands around.Satchel came in with the parts and most of the lyrics .
We sat down in a Steakhouse in Las Vegas one afternoon and arranged what will forever be known as ... Weenie Ride . ''
