This is a song from the third album by Canadian indie rock band Wolf Parade .
The tracks were recorded quickly in one take to capture the feeling of the group in performance .
Wolf Parade drummer Arlen Thompson told Chart Attack the band were surprised how this multi-layered song turned out .
`` It was rewritten and rearranged a couple of times , '' he said .
`` I think it kind of fell into place , and then we recorded it .
And when we listened back to it , we kind of went , ` What the f -- k ? '
It 's a pretty strange arrangement .
There 's a lot going on and I think we did n't really know what we had until we tracked it and listened to it .
Then we could kind of take in what everyone else was doing.I think it might be one of the hardest songs we 've ever written to pull off live , or to pull it off confidently . ''
The album title is a reference to the Vancouver World 's Fair .
That , according to the National Post , was when the band first laid `` the bedrock of their musical aspirations and imaginations . ''
