This is the title track and lead-off song from American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne 's twelfth album .
He recalled to Uncut magazine in an interview with their August 2010 issue : `` How records get made is the most fascinating thing to me .
I love ` The Naked Ride Home ' as a recording .
-LRB- band guitarist -RRB- Mark Goldenberg was playing structurally on the original session , and I was going to overdub him doing lead on top , but I wound up adding this great guitarist Val McCallum to the Band just to play that part.It 's a deceiving song ; it plays a trick on the listener because ` Just take off your clothes and I 'll drive you home ' sounds like a pick-up line .
You do n't find out until the end that these are married people .
The assumption is there that it 's about one thing when it 's really about another .
I love language so much in that way . ''
