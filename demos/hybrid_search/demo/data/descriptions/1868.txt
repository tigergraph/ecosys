This is the first single released by The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger , a duo consisting of Sean Lennon and his girlfriend , the model turned musician Charlotte Kemp-Muhl .
Amy Winehouse producer Mark Ronson helped out on bass and production .
Bet you did n't know Ronson is the stepson of Mick Jones from Foreigner .
The B-side is a cover version of Serge Gainsbourg 's `` Comic Strip , '' featuring French singer-songwriter Matthieu Chedid .
Kemp-Muhl told Spinner : `` A lot of our song titles will originate from an old poem that I wrote and then -LSB- Sean -RSB- and I will flesh out the lyrics .
-LSB- ` Jardin ' -RSB- was representative of where we were , having fun in the studio and jamming with Mark . ''
