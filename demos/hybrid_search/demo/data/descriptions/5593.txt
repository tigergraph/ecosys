This song in which Carey tries her hand at Jamaican patois , features Damian Marley , the youngest son of Bob Marley .
Damian Marley is best known for his hit single `` Welcome to Jamrock . ''
Carey co-wrote this with songwriter and back-up singer Cri $ tyle -LRB- Crystal Johnson -RRB- and producer Jermaine Dupri .
The New York recording artist said about this song : '' ` Cruise Control ' was the second trip I took to Atlanta to work with Jermaine .
What it really means is , it goes -LSB- sings -RSB- ` Might need to go slow , I do n't know , Why ease up on the break , Every time I see his face . '
Basically , you need to slow down , because every time you 're around this guy , you 're going a little too fast , 'cause he 's the wrong type of guy for you to be with , but you know that , but you do n't know how to handle that .
So it was cool to kinda co-write that with JD and with Cri $ tyle , because you know , it 's coming from a woman 's point of view and also coming from JD 's point of view of making the track really hot . ''
