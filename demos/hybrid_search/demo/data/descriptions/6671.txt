This was the first song that Andrew McMahon recorded for his debut EP , The Pop Underground .
The former Jack 's Mannequin frontman explained to Aol Music that initially the writing process got off to a difficult start .
`` I had just finished a really inspiring two-day writing session for another artist and went out to celebrate with some friends , '' he said .
`` We ended up watching the sun come up despite the fact I was scheduled to meet a young producer in the morning to begin work on some of my own material .
I spent the first half of the day hungover , hitting dead ends , working on a song I had written prior .
`` Finally McMahon found the inspiration to pen a song that reflected the lessons he 's learned from the past .
`` Mark , the producer I 'd just met , finally said , ' I think we should write something brand new . '
He put up a beat , and it brought me out of my fog , '' said McMahon .
`` I laid down the simple piano line you hear in the intro and this boozy , regretful lyric .
It quickly turned into flashbacks from my childhood and glimpses into the future .
In a lot of ways it 's about finding forgiveness and learning how to acknowledge the past in a way that lets you live in the present . ''
