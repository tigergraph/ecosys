The lead vocal on the chorus contains just one word : `` Fire , '' which Michael Stipe draws out into a long wail .
In the background , you can hear bass player Mike Mills singing , `` She 's comin ' down on her own , now . ''
This is not based on any real person or event .
The band made up the lyrics while they were on a tour .
This was R.E.M. 's first hit song .
They had been recording since 1981 and growing a following .
Often misinterpreted as a love song , this is just the opposite .
Michael Stipe describes this song as about using people over and over .
It 's deceptive because it could be a love song until the line , `` A simple prop to occupy my time . ''
For a while , Stipe thought this was too brutal a song to record .
He told Q magazine in 1992 : `` It 's probably better that they think it 's a love song at this point .
That song just came up from somewhere and I recognized it as being really violent and awful .
But it was n't directed at any one person .
I would never write a song like that .
Even if there was one person in the world thinking , This song is about me , I could never sing it or put it out ... I did n't want to record that , I thought it was too much .
Too brutal .
I think there 's enough of that ugliness around . ''
Bush played this at Woodstock '99 with a much harder sound .
