You know that guy who gets the hottest girl and can still get away with just about anything around her ?
We think Josh Kelley might be that guy .
He married the actress Katherine Heigl , then wrote a song about a girl called `` Baby Blue Eyes '' - Heigl 's eyes are definitely BROWN .
Kelley , who wrote this song with the Nashville cat Lee Brice , told us : `` We both wrote that about our girls .
And my wife 's eyes are brown , but he won out on getting his girl 's eyes on there .
But we wrote it about our girls and how much we love our girls .
That 's kind of about it on that one .
That 's just what it is , it 's about how much we love our ladies , and he was talking to me about how pretty he thinks his girl is and I said , ` My girl 's pretty , too . '
And how cool , and I was like , ` My girl 's cool , too .
Let 's write about our women . '
Van Morrison already got brown eyes , so I do n't even know if you can put another brown-eyed song out there . ''
