This was Goldfrapp 's first UK top 10 chart entry peaking at # 4 and the electro duo 's most successful single to date , helped by its use in T-Mobile adverts .
`` Ooh la La '' also topped the Billboard Dance charts and reached # 1 in Spain .
This was Goldfrapp 's first song to feature the electric guitar , an instrument that they had previously avoided due to its overly recognizable rhythm .
When the duo recorded the song , Will Gregory played the keyboard bass as Alison sang .
Her microphone picked up a rattling noise of Gregory 's pressing the keys , which they added to the chorus .
The song is Alison Goldfrapp 's homage to the playful vocals of T Rex 's Marc Bolan .
`` Decadent and ooh-la-la , '' she noted in publicity materials .
`` We 've always been into layered vocals and how they treated vocals on albums in the 70s , using slap-back effects and thick drum sounds .
I love that campness , that slightly throwaway but slightly nasty poutiness which is always appealing .
And Marc Bolan was always bloody great at that .
As was Marlene Dietrich .
Sulky , sexual and ambiguous . ''
