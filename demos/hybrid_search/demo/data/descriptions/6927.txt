This was written after George Harrison , who is a huge fan , told John Bonham that the trouble with Led Zeppelin is that they do n't do any ballads .
John Paul Jones played the Mellotron , providing an orchestral effect .
In an interview with Rolling Stone , Plant said this was his best Led Zeppelin vocal performance .
Robert Plant 's lyrics deal with the changing emotions of love .
This was one of the few Zeppelin songs where all 4 members shared the composer credit .
Drummer John Bonham took brushes to his drums on this song , demonstrating his versatility .
Surprisingly , he continued to use them even when the song gets heavy .
