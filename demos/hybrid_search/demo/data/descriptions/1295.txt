This song finds The Lonely Island addressing hip-hop 's machismo , which often comes out as homophobia .
Andy Samberg explained to Spinner UK : '' ` No homo ' has become so ubiquitous a phrase that we felt like it had to be addressed .
We saw little kids saying it , like , ` Wan na come over and play , no homo ' and it just seemed ridiculous so we wrote the song .
We hope the reaction to it is laughter .
That 's always the desired reaction . ''
