This song finds Carpenter reflecting on one of the most upsetting days she had to endure after divorcing her husband , contractor Timmy Smith .
`` That was a moment-by-moment replay of having to clean out my former spouse 's things from my house , '' she explained to Billboard magazine .
`` I think anyone who has ever had to do that will testify that it 's pretty harrowing to do that .
It was a very difficult day .
Writing this song and reliving every moment .
The repeating line is ` These are your instructions , ' and the reality is that there are no instruction manuals for getting through something like this .
You just have to steel yourself , and be as strong as you possibly can . ''
