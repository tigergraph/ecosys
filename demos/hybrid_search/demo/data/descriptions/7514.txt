This anti-love song is the first single off Pennsylvania alternative metal band Halestorm 's sophomore album , The Strange Case Of ... .
`` The guys gave me carte blanche to write about whatever I wanted , so a lot of personal stuff came out , '' vocalist Lzzy Hale told Noisecreep about the record 's lyrical content .
`` Open up those floodgates !
We 've been living two feet from each other forever now , so a lot has happened . ''
Lzzy Hale explained to Revolver magazine that rather than her usual lyrics which find her attacking guys , this song finds her rooting for her man .
`` This is kind of my attempt to be on the guy 's side for once , '' she said , `` because on the last record , you guys were n't entirely too happy with me -LSB- Laughs -RSB- ... The singer added : `` Well , most of you like it rough anyways ... but , I 've been hanging out with guys my entire life .
My entire band is made up of a bunch of guys.I 've seen my share of band girlfriends , and honestly , a lot of them are so obsessed with the Cosmopolitan-like quizzes and , ` Am I being loved enough ? '
and ` Is my man right for me ? '
This is my attempt at just kind of being one girl to kind of stand next to the guy . ''
Lzzy Hale -LRB- from Guitar World magazine -RRB- : `` Obviously I kind of like that title .
` Love Bites ' was musically directly inspired by a cover record we did a few months ago called ReAniMate .
And on that we covered a Skid Row song , ` Slave To The Grind ' , and a Guns 'N' Roses song , ` Out Ta Get Me ' , and the tempo of those songs was n't something we 've really tried to write .
But it 's definitely a cool title .
I think we went through this wonderful self-discovery about ourselves and realized , ` Hey !
We can pull off this type of stuff . ' ''
Hale explained the single 's meaning to Noisecreep : `` The song is my little stab against the media 's portrayal of love , '' she said .
`` Your heart can not be measured or judged by the quizzes in magazines and scenes in movies .
So for both boys and girls I tell you this , love who and how you want , and for god 's sake when love bites , bite back !
That bitch can eat her heart out ! ''
According to producer Howard Benson , this was one of the quickest songs that he 's ever recorded in his studios .
