This Kenny Chesney and Scooter Carusoe penned song is the third single from Country music artist David Nail 's debut album , I 'm About to Come Alive .
Chesney gave the song to Nail after deciding not to record it for himself .
Though Nail loved this the first time he heard it , he was n't so happy when he realized that Kenny Chesney was the man behind the song .
`` I fell in love with the song long before I knew Kenny Chesney had written it , '' Nail explained to The Boot .
`` In fact , if anything I was a little saddened by the fact that he did write it , because I just assumed that it was borderline impossible for me to have the chance to record it .
And we actually suffered through a couple of different Chesney records waiting to see if he was in fact going to record it . ''
Nail explained to The Tennessean that as soon as he heard the demo for this song , his attention was drawn to it : `` I just knew that this was that song that I had been searching for , probably the entire time that I 'd been in Nashville , '' Nail said .
`` Being from a small town in southeast Missouri , all the imagery in the song was something that I could really relate to .
I can close my eyes and be back in that small town - Friday night football game - I just love it . ''
