This is one of four contributions that Nick Littlemore , of the Australian synthpop duo Empire of the Sun makes to Black Light .
Groove Armada 's Tom Findlay told The Guardian March 4 , 2010 that Littlemore turned up at the studio with his own ideas about how things should be done .
`` Working with Nick was a positive but hugely challenging experience , '' Findlay said .
`` He came in with really , really strong views -- but none the worse for that . ''
