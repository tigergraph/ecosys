Johnson : `` It 's been around for a little while .
I had the first verse , and I was always tooling around with that .
And then the second verse came along later .
It was a song that was pretty much complete -LRB- before entering the studio -RRB- .
It was really just a song that I wrote for my wife .
The love songs always start out for her , but then I try to make them pretty broad so they 're for everybody by the end . ''
