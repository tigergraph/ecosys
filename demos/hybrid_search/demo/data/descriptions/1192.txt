This was the first song that frontman and chief songwriter Scott Hutchison wrote for Pedestrian Verse .
He told The Skinny magazine : `` Lyrically , it set a standard which I tried to uphold on the rest of the songs .
It was my first foray into writing about someone else 's life and constructing a character other than a version of myself . ''
This song was originally included as the title track of Frightened Rabbit 's EP State Hospital , which was released on September 24 , 2012 .
The album title is taken from a lyric in this song .
Hutchinson said : `` I felt it was a nicely faceted title , with enough layered meaning to remain open to interpretation .
Above all though , it was a gauntlet I threw down for myself .
If you call your album ` Pedestrian Verse , ' you ca n't settle for any old lyric .
It forced me to better myself . ''
Hutchinson admitted to The Guardian that on Frightened Rabbit 's previous album , The Winter of Mixed Drinks , he was writing about himself and tried , to veil the meanings `` because I did n't want to potentially hurt people in my life . ''
On Pedestrian Verse , Hutchinson found himself writing about others such as this song 's woman `` born into a grave '' .
`` I thought , can I invest the same detail and emotion in someone else 's experiences ? ''
he said .
`` I wanted it to be a dense album , but I did n't want it to feel like a diary entry . ''
