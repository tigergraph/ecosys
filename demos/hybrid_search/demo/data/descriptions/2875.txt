This is the first single from American soul singer Macy Gray 's fifth album , The Sellout .
The song was originally a dance track until Gray turned it into more of a rollicking peace and love sing-a-long .
`` You get bombarded with opinion and expectations and what other people want and you forget what you do well , '' she said in press materials .
`` That song is what I do well . ''
This song was played during the series finale of the ABC dramedy series Ugly Betty .
Another ABC series , Private Practice , also used the song in its series-ending final episode .
The music video , which was directed by Tom Petty 's daughter Adria , features Gray performing the song with cheerleaders along with kids jumping rope , dancing and hand clapping .
This song was inspired by Gray 's teenage daughter , who one day Macy overheard laughing hysterically in the next room .
`` I was having a really bad day and I heard my daughter just cracking up in the next room , '' she recalled .
`` She has this really great laugh and I did n't even know what she was laughing at .
I thought ` at least she 's happy . '
And I felt at least I had n't failed there , because my daughter 's happy . ''
The song was picked up as the end-title song for the 2010 Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher starring feature film , Killers .
