This was the title track from Frampton 's 1977 I 'm In You album , his fifth studio album and the one where he had a lot of pressure from producers to match the sales success of Frampton and Frampton Comes Alive ! .
This song is the highest Frampton ever climbed on the charts .
Instruments here include a Baldwin Piano , ARP String Synthesizer-generated string section , Moog synthesizer , and a Gibson Les Paul .
Despite what one might at first think from the title , Frampton meant being `` in '' somebody in the spiritual sense .
Sort of like the `` I am he as you are he as you are me ... '' part from `` I Am The Walrus . ''
`` I 'm In You '' is the song which Frank Zappa is parodying with `` I Have Been in You '' on his 1979 album Sheik Yerbouti .
That album had a particularly racy theme throughout - it also included `` Bobby Brown Goes Down '' and `` Jewish Princess , '' definitely two of Zappa 's most ribald works .
