This song celebrates the freedom and opportunity in America .
Mellencamp acknowledges that the American people still have problems with poverty and bigotry , but he feels the common man will continue to make America great .
During the 2008 US presidential campaign , John McCain used this song at his events while campaigning for the Republican nomination .
Mellencamp , who supported the Democrat John Edwards , sent a letter to the McCain camp in which his publicist asked , `` If you 're such a true conservative , why are you playing songs that have a very populist pro-labor message written by a guy who would find no argument if you characterized him as left of center ? ''
McCain stopped using the song .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- Long before this was officially released , it was used in commercials for the Chevrolet Silverado .
This was unusual , as Mellencamp had never let his song be used for commercial purposes , and had spoken out against the practice .
He changed his mind because it became so difficult for him to get his music heard , as radio stations and MTV generally ignore older artists and record companies do n't promote them well .
The Chevy campaign gave him the opportunity to present the song to a very large audience .
