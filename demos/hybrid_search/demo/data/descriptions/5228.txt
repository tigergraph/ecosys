`` Scare Easy '' was written by Tom Petty and is the second track on Mudcrutch 's self-titled first album .
Media appearances include this song serving as the soundtrack for a commercial for the TV series My Name Is Earl in 2008 , and playing over the end credits of the 2008 western film Appaloosa - although the song is omitted from the film 's soundtrack album .
It should be noted that `` Scare Easy '' is from the reformed Mudcrutch .
The 2008 line-up of Tom Petty , Mike Campbell , Tom Leadon , Benmont Tench , and Randall Marsh is identical to the original formation of the group minus Jim Lenahan - and since Jim Lenahan 's only original job was lead vocals , Tom Petty now fills that slot adequately.Mudcrutch originally formed in 1970 .
They released a single that did n't chart , puttered around , and went nowhere .
The group members all split off to go their own ways ; Petty , Tench , and Campbell of course hitting it big with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers .
Petty reformed the group in 2008 and released their first album .
As near as we can tell , this stands as a record for the longest amount of time passing between the formation of a band and its debut album , at 38 years !
