This features vocals by the Soul singer-songwriter Anthony Hamilton .
When this entered the American album chart at # 9 , it became the third highest-charting album of Green 's career and his biggest debut ever .
Only Let 's Stay Together -LRB- # 8 -RRB- and I 'm Still in Love With You -LRB- # 4 -RRB- peaked in higher positions , both in 1972 .
The Lay It Down album was produced by The Roots ' Ahmir '' ?
uestlove '' Thompson together with keyboardist and frequent Erykah Badu collaborator James Poyser .
It was the Reverend Al 's first secular album since 1977 's The Belle Album .
Green told Billboard magazine : `` I 've never heard anything quite like it , because I 've never had anybody produce me other than Willie Mitchell . ''
And when you give these young kids a shot at it , it 's interesting to see the art they make .
It 's beautiful .
`` Thompson added that he and Poyser had vintage Green in mind when they began working on this album in 2005 at Electric Lady studios in New York .
He recalled : `` I told Blue Note that if they truly want a follow-up to The Belle Album come and see me .
I just said that , ` I 'm going to create a record that will absolutely be the 30-year follow-up to The Belle Album .
That 's not to negate the last 30 years of his work , but there is a very specific reason why most people consider The Belle Album to be the official last Al Green record , and I really wanted to recapture that sound . ''
Mojo magazine July 2008 asked Al Green what the ` it ' is in this song 's title .
The Reverend replied : `` That 's between my old lady and me .
But everyone knows what you 're talking about .
` Lay it down ' C'mon !
Put your hat on the floor .
That 's what it 's about .
When you stay away from each other like that , a long period of time like that , when Al 's on tour for 28 days I finally get to go home .
I 'm tired , she 's tired , but still the love that you have for each other ... it finds its way . ''
