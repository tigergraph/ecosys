Brown -LRB- From Clash Magazine -RRB- : `` It 's kind of addressing that I 'm still here like 20 years later and I 'm still going and I 've still got a long way to go .
I 've come a long way already , but I 've still got a long distance to go .
I 'm still the musical Marathon Man , because I 'm still running .
And there 's not many who come out in ' 88 , '89 who still are . ''
