This is a hidden track at the end of My December .
Clarkson revealed to Newsweek , that she wrote this song in a bar .
She added : `` I actually wrote that song on a napkin .
The best part is , I came home and I kept trying to remember the melody ; I was pretty inebriated , and I sang it into my Mac computer .
Listening to the song the next day was pretty funny . ''
