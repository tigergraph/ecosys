Phillip Phillips was helped by David Ryan Harris -LRB- Lupe Fiasco and Guy Sebastian 's `` Battle Scars '' -RRB- to write this song .
`` I had the music written , '' he told The Hollywood Reporter .
`` The first verse and the chorus were written , I just did n't have a second verse .
So David Ryan , who plays with John Mayer a lot , came in there , we got to know each other a bit , and I showed him what I had .
He started pushing me to write more , and after a couple of days , this came to me one night : ` Hope is just a ray of what everyone should see .
Alone is the street where you found me .
Scared of what 's behind you .
Scared of what 's in front .
Live with what you have now .
Make the best of what 's to come . ' ''
