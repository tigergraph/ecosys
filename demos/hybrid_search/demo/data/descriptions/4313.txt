Pop Evil penned this hard-driving track about the constant grind to survive in the music business .
It also serves as a sort of manifesto for the Michigan five-piece .
`` It 's about our battles , '' said singer Leigh Kakaty .
`` Not focusing on the things we ca n't control , if we really want to be a band that stands the test of time we have to write the music that connects .
We have to dig our way out of the trenches . ''
Released as the lead single from Pop Evil 's third album , Onyx , the song became their first-ever # 1 on the active rock radio chart .
