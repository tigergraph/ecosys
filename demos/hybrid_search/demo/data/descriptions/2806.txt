This song was played at the funeral of serial killer Aileen Wuornos as part of her final request .
She had listened to the song and the entire album Tigerlily continually while on death row .
When confronted with this , Natalie was initially shocked but gave permission to use the song in the documentary Aileen : Life and Death of a Serial Killer , saying that `` It 's very odd to think of the places my music can go once it leaves my hands .
If it gave her some solace , I have to be grateful . ''
Wuornos was also the subject of the film Monster .
