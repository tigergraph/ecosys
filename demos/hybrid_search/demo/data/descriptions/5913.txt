With guest vocals by Alice Cooper , this song follows what was a somewhat common theme in Metal music in 1985 : busting on school .
Cooper 's `` School 's Out '' and Twisted Sister 's `` We 're Not Gon na Take It '' also expressed this sentiment in a somewhat comical way .
The video features the comedian Bobcat Goldthwait , who is known for his work on the Police Academy movies .
This song 's video featuring zombies created by special effects wizard Tom Savini was banned from MTV for excessive violence and gore and resulted in a major financial loss for both Twisted Sister and Atlantic records .
