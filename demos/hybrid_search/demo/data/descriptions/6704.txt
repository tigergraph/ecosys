This song finds Williams singing about going deep-sea diving with her beau , with only love acting as their safety gear .
Speaking with AbsolutePunk the singer explained how her lyrics for Paramore were inspired by one of her bandmate 's relationships .
`` Seeing one of my best friends -LSB- bassist Jeremy Davis -RSB- so happily married does inspire me in a great way to keep believing in love , '' she said .
`` It 's hard , man !
I really have to fight the realist in me at times .
Nonetheless , there are a couple of really fun love songs on this album . ''
This was the first song that Paramore demoed for their self-titled fourth album .
