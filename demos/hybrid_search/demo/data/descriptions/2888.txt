Perri penned the song with the help of former Evanescence member David Hodges , who has also written tunes for Kelly Clarkson , Train and Daughtry .
She told Artist Direct that the lyrics are about being in love with someone she worked with but not being able to tell them .
`` I wrote this about the summer of 2010 , '' she explained .
`` I fell in love with someone , and we had to work pretty closely together .
I had to pretend I did n't like him , which was the hardest thing for me because I 'm not good at lying -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
The song is about the feelings and swimming in that kind of tension when you 're around someone and trying to keep it cool .
That 's what it means for me .
Instead of telling him I loved him , I wrote it to him in a song .
That 's where I go . ''
Perri recorded a new version with her friend Jason Mraz , which was released as the third single from Lovestrong .
The pair first sung the song together in San Diego in December 2011 as they were doing a radio show .
`` Something happened , '' she recalled to Artist Direct .
`` Everyone in the audience felt it .
My band felt it .
Our managers felt it .
It was like , ` What was that ? '
There was a three-and-a-half minute journey we went on that was pretty magical .
I 'm a huge Jason fan so , of course , I felt it .
The fact everyone else did probably proved it was something special .
We decided to do it again at some other function we were playing together .
I was going to put out as a single anyway , and the idea began to get dreamed up . ''
The song was used for the official theme for the ABC TV drama series Revenge .
The first series debuted on September 21 , 2011 and became ABC 's highest-rated series overall in Wednesday 's 10 p.m. slot since Lost during the 2006-07 television season .
