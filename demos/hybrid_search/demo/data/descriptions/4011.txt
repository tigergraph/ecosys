The second single by the British-Irish Pop boy band The Wanted 's second studio album received its radio premiere on May 24 , 2011 and was released July 10 , 2011 .
Speaking about their latest song , band member Tom Parker said : `` When we first heard ` Glad You Came ' we just knew it had to be the first single from the new album .
We all felt it was a new , refreshing sound and a perfect song for the summer which really gets you in the mood for a party . ''
The song had a significant sales jump in the US after being performed on the third mid-season finale of Glee by the show 's Grant Gustin along with fellow members of the Warblers .
The track shifted 188,000 downloads throughout the following week resulting in it jumping from # 23 to # 5 on Hot 100 .
This meant that The Wanted became the first UK Boyband to achieve a top 5 hit in the States.Tom Parker of The Wanted told MTV UK that when the boys got the call that the song was getting covered on Glee , they reacted to the news with , er , glee .
`` I thought it was absolutely great , and it was the first time I had seen a dance routine put to the song , '' he said .
`` So it was really strange actually , 'cause obviously we do n't dance .
I rang up the boys , like , ` Boys , maybe we should start dancing because actually it looks really good . '
-LSB- Our manager -RSB- Scooter -LSB- Braun -RSB- rang us up , and he was like , ` So your song 's going to be covered by Glee , ' and if you could have measured the level of noise in the car at that very time , some might call it deafening , we were screaming so loud , '' he continued .
`` I could n't even believe it .
It 's an honor really to do something like that .
I think it represents -LSB- that -RSB- the song 's a really good song .
To be honest , it 's all a bit surreal . ''
The song 's music video was shot in Ibiza , and finds the boys cavorting with hot models .
Jay revealed to MTV UK : `` The theory of the video was take The Wanted to Ibiza and just film everything and then just cut bits that were useable .
But the girls were models , they were n't just girls we picked .
`` However Max admitted : `` Actually no , the girl I had to spend time with was just literally picked up off the street after a night out . ''
This dance-pop song about getting people to party was written by Steve Mac , Wayne Hector and Ed Drewett , the same trio who also penned `` All Time Low '' and `` Lightning . ''
Speaking with Artist Direct , band member Jay McGuiness described the threesome as `` our dream team . ''
He went on to say , `` When they work together , they make the greatest songs ever .
They played ` Glad You Came ' for us and it was a different sound for us .
We had poppy rock and cool string vibes going .
We liked the song , went in and did our version of the vocal , and we were surprised !
We started doing it at gigs , and the fans went crazy , so we knew it had to be the next single . ''
