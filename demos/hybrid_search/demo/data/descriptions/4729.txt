Lead singer Brett Anderson wrote this about the descent of a close friend into major depression .
His friend ultimately took his on life , which Anderson addressed in later songs such as `` He 's Gone '' and `` Simon . ''
This is often misinterpreted as a song about the dissolution of Anderson 's relationship with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann .
