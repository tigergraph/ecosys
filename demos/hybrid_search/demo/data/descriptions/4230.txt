Maino told AllHipHop.com that If Tomorrow Comes features , `` real talk and real situation in life . ''
He added that this song , `` is not really about me being a rapper , it 's about a situation everybody can relate to .
So I try to make my music to where certain other people can take something out of it , not just listen to some ill metaphor or something .
That is not what I am in it for . ''
The song was produced by Mista Raja and co-produced by Maino .
The Brooklyn rapper told AllHipHop.com that he had a co-production credit as , `` the whole record is my idea . ''
He explained : `` My man Mista Raja , I called him up and told him I got this idea , I want to use this particular record .
We used the beat that -LSB- Mary J. Blige -RSB- had , we found that beat , shout out to my man , DJ Unique , for getting the instrumental to us .
What I did was Mr. Raja , he looped it , and I rapped to it .
So , I 'm getting my Diddy on . ''
