The fourth single to be released from Until We Have Faces started with a drum beat that Red 's stickman Joe Rickard did by himself in a studio .
He told us that sent it to guitarist Anthony Armstrong , who `` wrote this awesome riff and the song started building .
`` Armstrong then penned the lyrics around the concept of , `` being in some kind of relationship and you just do n't want to be hurting anymore , and you want that person to basically say to you that they never did love you .
You want them to do that so you can feel like this is what 's right , instead of having that pain that you ca n't get rid of . ''

Joe told us that Red `` want to write stuff for our fans that can really mean something to them . ''
The band ask them via their Facebook page what they want them to write about , as they , `` want to see what 's hurting people , why they 're calling out to us , what they need .
`` According to Joe , `` Lie To Me '' is a song `` that can relate to a lot of people - anybody that 's been in any kind of relationship where they have been heartbroken or hurt . ''
He added that the main goal of the song was trying to find a positive out of the hurt of a broken relationship .
`` It was something that was negative - the girl that broke your heart - that left you to find a positive , and just have faith in God . ''
