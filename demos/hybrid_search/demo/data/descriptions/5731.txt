This is a track from British Acid Jazz group Jamiroquai 's seventh studio album , Rock Dust Light Star .
There has been speculation that front man Jay Kay is addressing on this tune the end of his romance with his former fianc√©e : the actress and TV presenter Denise Van Outen , who has since married actor Lee Mead .
`` That song is not entirely about the woman you imagine it is , '' he told The Daily Mail .
`` It 's based on someone I know , but the lyrics have been switched around .
It 's about a girl I used to go out with , who then got - married .
It 's a bit cheeky . ''
