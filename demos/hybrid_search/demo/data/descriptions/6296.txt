An empowerment anthem , this song finds Spears singing about how despite her difficulties in love , she continues to get stronger .
This was written by Swedish producers Max Martin and Rami Yacoub .
Martin wrote several songs for Spears , including `` Baby One More Time . ''
Spears refers to her first hit `` Baby One More Time '' in the lyrics , `` My loneliness ai n't killing me no more . ''
-LRB- thanks , Mathura - Newport Coast , CA -RRB- The song 's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn , who later helmed the clip for Womanizer .
It featured Spears in a semi-futuristic world breaking up with her cheating boyfriend .
He recalled to MTV News : `` For ` Stronger , ' she said , ' I would like to dance in a chair and drive in a car and break up with -LSB- my -RSB- boyfriend .
Those are your three elements . '
And then , as a director , you go , ` OK , well , how do I make that cool ? '
`` Kahn added : `` I think this video is interesting because it 's got a very sophisticated , adult look to it .
It 's definitely a departure from the sort of candy-colored videos she was doing before , so I always thought this was the transition between Britney the teenage pop star and Britney the sort of diva she became .
`` For many , the most memorable part of the clip are the dance sequences with the metal chair .
Kahn recalled to MTV News : `` She pitched it to me as an original concept by herself , but the first thing that came to my mind when I thought of the chair sequence , in terms of how it applies to music videos , was Janet Jackson 's ` Pleasure Principle ' - the iconic chair sequence in that .
`` In the video Spears sports some gray eye-shadow which was an aspect that Kahn was insistent upon .
`` One of the big things I wanted to do here , that I was just obsessed with ... I know it sounds really strange , but I wanted her to have gray eye shadow , '' he said .
`` And I think it looks really good .
I remember when I was looking at the close-ups , Britney goes , ` You 're really obsessed with this gray eye shadow ! '
and I go , ` Yes , absolutely . '
But if you look at it , it just makes her eyes pop like crazy . ''
