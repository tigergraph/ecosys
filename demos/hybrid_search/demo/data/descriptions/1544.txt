Sheryl Crow has commented on her web site about this angry , environmentally conscious song : `` I do n't believe anyone would argue that these are complicated and troubling times we are navigating through .
At any given moment , I find myself in a real panic about the future of humanity .
` Shine Over Babylon ' is in every way a desperate cry for understanding .
Perhaps it is even a battle song in the face of fear . ''
