In an interview with Fresh Radio recorded at the Rendezvous Hotel , Skipton , during her Birds tour , Bic said this song was recorded `` pretty much live ; '' the strings were arranged by long term collaborator Neil Finn , who also played piano on it .
Of the song itself , she said it was in chanteuse style , a tragic love song , the message of which was that when love goes bad you 're better off letting it go .
Asked if it was written from personal experience , she laughed '' ... yeah , I suppose so . ''
