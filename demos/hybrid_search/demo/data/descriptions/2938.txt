This is the title track from New York-based indie rock group The Walkmen 's sixth studio album .
The band 's frontman Hamilton Leithauser explained that trips to the Portuguese city from which the album takes its title were a great influence on its sound .
Said Leithauser : `` None of us had ever been there , and we were really blown away by the place .
The topography and architecture are stunningly handsome .
It was a trip that outshone a lot of others .
We 've never had much luck in Europe , and the Portuguese were surprisingly accommodating .
I think those two trips really helped keep us motivated while making this record .
We named the record ` Lisbon ' as sort of a thank you and a small tribute . ''
