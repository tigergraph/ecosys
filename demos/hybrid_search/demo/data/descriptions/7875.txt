This is the third single from Intimacy : Album III , the third studio album by American R&B artist Kem .
The album version is a duet with vocalist Maurissa Rose .
Kem explained the collaboration in an interview with SoulTracks : `` We worked together on the -LRB- Tyler Perry -RRB- Madea 's Family Reunion soundtrack song called ` Tonight . '
She 's a great , great vocalist and adds a lot of value to what I do , because I wanted to have that Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell-type ` go-to girl ' for all of my duets .
We tried a couple of different vocalists , but I 'm glad that we finally ended up using her for the record . ''
Kem recorded a new version of the track for the single version , substituting Chrisette Michele for the duet part originally sung by Maurissa Rose .
`` I just wanted to add another dimension to the record , '' Kem explained to Billboard magazine .
`` That record throws you back to the days of Anita Baker or Gladys Knight or Patti Labelle , but I wanted something on the record that would be a little bit unexpected .
Chrisette is a great vocalist and she 's a radio darling , so I wanted to open it up a little bit and invite some listeners who may not automatically venture to a Kem record . ''
