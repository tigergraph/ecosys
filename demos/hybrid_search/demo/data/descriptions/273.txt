The Dixie Chicks got a lot of help with the songwriting on Taking The Long Way , with Keb Mo , Neil Finn , Mike Campbell and Linda Perry among the writers who worked with them .
This song was co-written by Sheryl Crow .
The band spoke of this song in a statement released by their publicist : Martie Maguire : `` I had an idea for a song where the person knows in their heart that a relationship was n't right , but still wants the other person to look back on it as the best time in their life .
I think I was wished that that 's how my ex-husband looked back on our 5 years together , but I know that 's not the case .
But hey , you can make it true in a song , right ?
`` Natalie Maines : I had just watched The Big Chill , so that 's what I was visualizing .
People who were so in love when they were really young , and you really think you 're going to spend the rest of your lives together , but then life just takes turns .
We felt an instant connection to Sheryl , she 's very real and funny , easy to talk to and open about herself .
`` Emily Robison : `` Sheryl Crow worked out the chord progression .
We worked on this song together when we were recording ` Home . ' ''
