This disco-twangy tune is the title track from the twenty-sixth studio album by American Country music singer Reba McEntire .
The album title relates to the many roles that McEntire plays in her life and she told Jam !
Music that she believes the toughest challenge today 's women face is simply finding time for themselves in order to stay sane .
`` I have been all these women in this album , '' explained the country icon .
`` I have lectured a boy or two .
I have been divorced .
I have a child .
I have been in love .
All these songs - it 's the women - all the hats they wear .
And I 've worn all the hats in this album , so this is all the women I am . ''
`` She 's a giver , '' McEntire elaborated .
`` She 's a caretaker .
She 's a lover .
She 's a mother .
She 's a worker and she can triple-task at one time .
Finding time for herself and not feeling guilty about it is probably the most important thing she can do for herself .
I love getting older and maturing .
You learn about yourself , to do things for yourself and not to feel guilty .
That 's a big step for women .
I 've got the kids , the work , being a wife .
When that day off happens , I cherish it .
I 'll schedule lunch with my girlfriends .
I love to do that .
That 's a treat for me . ''
