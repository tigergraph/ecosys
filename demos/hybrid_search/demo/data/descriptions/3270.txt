This upbeat number is a track from the deluxe version of American pop singer Jesse McCartney 's third studio album , Departure : Recharged .
A re-mixed version with hip-hop singer/producer T-Pain was released as its second single .
The collaboration with T-Pain came about after the rapper took notice of McCartney 's stripped-down version of his single , `` Buy U A Drank -LRB- Shawty Snappin ' -RRB- , '' during a Yahoo performance .
McCartney co-wrote this with James Bunton and Corron Ty Cole in Miami .
Bunton and Cole also produced the track .
The twosome work together as a production duo known as The Movement and they got their big break when they co-wrote and co-produced `` Leavin ' '' for McCartney .
