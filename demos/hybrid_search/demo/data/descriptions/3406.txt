`` What You Need '' was written by Andrew Farriss , keyboardist and key composer for the Australian band INXS .
This song was almost `` the one that got away . ''
Producer Chris Thomas advised the band that they needed one more guaranteed hit after they finished recording the Listen Like Thieves album .
They thought it over that night , came in and literally finished the song in a day , in time for the album to cut and ship.However , this is n't quite the magic trick it first appears ; Andrew Farriss had already made a demo tape with a song whose working title was `` Funk Song No. 13 , '' which evolved into `` What You Need . ''
Chris Thomas listened to the demo for `` Funk Song No. 13 '' and two other tapes , and picked this one because `` it was great .
I thought , ' I could listen to that groove for ten minutes ! '
I said , ` Let 's work with that groove . '
So we went with that and in just two days it turned into the song that eventually broke them , ` What You Need ' . ''
Inspired by the success of `` What You Need '' and Listen Like Thieves , INXS was determined to make their next album be one in which `` all the songs were possible singles . ''
They certainly thought they were doing that , but when they finished Kick , Atlantic Records hated it .
INXS manager Chris Murphy recalled : `` They hated it , absolutely hated it .
They said there was no way they could get this music on rock radio . ''
Kick , of course , skyrocketed the charts and became the group 's most successful album .
Listen Like Thieves was considered INXS ' breakout album , giving them their first US Top-5 single .
It was also the first INXS album produced by the legendary Chris Thomas , who has also worked with The Beatles , Pink Floyd , Badfinger , Elton John , Pulp , and The Sex Pistols .
Thompson was to go on to lead INXS to ever-greater success .
