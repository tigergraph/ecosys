Vocalist Alex Trimble told NME : `` This is kind of a spooky , weird little number .
It starts off with this guitar hook that sounds like it should be in a Tim Burton film or something .
It 's got weird lyrics influenced by a day we spent in Mexico .
We went out to the pyramids and performed ancient rituals . ''
