`` September Sun '' is a reflection on a relationship that has long soured but yet still haunts the singer -LRB- Peter Steele -RRB- .
You can hear Steele scream the name Elizabeth during the chorus , a reminder of the love lost .
A person can easily relate to the emotions of the singer as many have an `` Elizabeth '' in their lives .
-LRB- thanks , wes - IL -RRB-
