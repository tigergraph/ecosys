Rapper Tauheed Epps formed the Hip-Hop duo Playaz Circle in 1997 with his high school friend Earl Conyers .
While Conyers was known as Dolla Boy , Epps adopted `` Tity Boi '' as his stage name .
Despite Epps ' denials , critics and fans alike speculated the name `` Tity Boi '' was meant to be derogatory towards women .
In early 2011 , Epps decided to change his moniker to the more `` family friendly '' name of 2 Chainz .
It also signified his second chance in music after being signed to DTP/Def Jam .
This DJ Mustard produced cut finds him proclaiming that there are bigger differences to him now than the fact that he 's changed his alias .
However to some ears , 2 Chainz ' generic boasts throughout his verses in which he proclaims his love of cars , girls , and riches contradict his claims to be `` different . ''
