`` The Angel and The Gambler '' is the first single released off the album Virtual XI .
The song deals with someone who wo n't be persuaded to stop risk taking .
In the music video , lead singer Blaze Bayley walks into a bar wearing a brown hat and coat .
This is in reference to Iron Maiden 's 1986 album Somewhere in Time , particularly the single `` Stranger in a Strange Land . ''
