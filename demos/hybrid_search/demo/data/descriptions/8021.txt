Running to 3 minutes and 38 seconds , Rafferty wrote the 6th track on his monster City To City album for his daughter , Martha .
In the 1970s , like a lot of music people , especially songwriters , Rafferty was embroiled in legal disputes , and this necessitated his commuting to London from his native Scotland .
`` Mattie 's Rag '' is a sort of Daddy 's home song for his return to see his daughter .
The song was released as a single backed by `` Home And Dry '' and in another release as the B Side of `` City To City '' , one version running to 4 minutes 9 seconds , and another to 5 minutes 35 seconds .
