This is the first single from Australian pop singer-songwriter Sia Furler 's fourth studio album , We Are Born .
She is best known for her collaborations with the British downtempo duo Zero 7 and her single `` Breathe Me , '' which was used on the last ever episode of Down Under .
Sia told CMU about her songwriting process : `` I 'm incredibly lazy , so most of the time I like to lay down when I 'm writing ; we often have beds in the studio !
Whoever I 'm writing with , we 'll usually start with the chords and then build around that , with sample drums , bass , guitar , piano .
Then we 'll work on the track until it 's at an acceptable stage , so that we can play it to management etc. .
Much much later , after we 've practised it enough so that it 's really sharp , we 'll record it live . ''
Sia joked to Spin Magazine that this is obviously `` a really deep song , as I 'm sure the title infers . ''
She added : `` It 's a song I 'd write for a movie like Sex And The City .
Seriously , I was trying to write a song that might get pitched for a girly movie .
It 's fun to dance to . ''
