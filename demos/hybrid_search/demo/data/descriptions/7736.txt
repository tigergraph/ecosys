Lambchop mainman Kurt Wagner explained to The Village Voice that this song came about as a result of a phone call .
Said Wagner : `` I 'm writing a line about something else and my wife calls on the phone telling me it 's National Talk Like A Pirate Day , I go , ` Oh , okay . '
And suddenly that leads to me thinking about my wife .
Then next thing I know I 'm looking at a picture of her , and she 's in her pajamas , she 's got a record player .
You know , there 's a hockey game in the little picture and I start describing the picture .
So the song started out as some sort of folk song , you know , and then next thing you know it becomes something else , but it was all because of what happened in the process of writing it : the phone rang . ''
