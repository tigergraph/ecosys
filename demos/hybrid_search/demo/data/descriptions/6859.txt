Artist Direct asked Matt Heafy what was the story behind this song .
The vocalist/guitarist replied : `` The title of the song involves two strands : one from Greek mythology and one from Judeo-Christian imagery and storytelling .
Thematically , I 'll give a general answer for all the lyrics of the entire album .
With every album we have ever done as Trivium , we 've been extremely clear-cut in terms of exactly what every single song is about .
With this record , some of the songs have multiple meanings .
Some are singular .
Some of them were even written stream-of-conscious , so the meanings of the songs are still being revealed even to me , which is really interesting .
With this record , there is no right or wrong answer to what any of these songs are about or any of the ways they can be interpreted by the listener or our fans .
So that is my long answer to what Prometheus and all of the songs are about .
It does have a multi-meaning literal allusion with the song title . ''
In Greek mythology , Prometheus was a Titan who stole fire from Zeus for the human race .
In revenge , Zeus had him chained to a rock where the unfortunate Prometheus ' liver was eaten daily by an eagle only to be regenerated each time .
Years later Hercules rescued him .
