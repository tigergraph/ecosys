Frontman Darwin Deez told OhDearyme that this is his favorite song from his band 's self-titled debut album .
He explained : `` It makes me happy the way people get cosy with it so easily .
And I love the way parts of its arrangement work together like machinery in a factory : each part doing its job , making it 's noise , contributing to the greater gestalt , which comes into view just in time for the song 's ending . ''
The song was released as the fifth single from Darwin Deez .
The singer told The Sun about the song : `` It was recorded months after the bulk of the album was completed .
I 've been looking forward to its release since ` Radar Detector ' first came out , knowing it was gon na be the banger track .
It 's a song that has been labelled mean-spirited , which it 's not .
It 's about a tumultuous friendship of mine , and while I want him to have a bad day today , ultimately I would n't wish it on him . ''
