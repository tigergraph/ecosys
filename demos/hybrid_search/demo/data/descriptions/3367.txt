This is the opening track of Bitter Tears : Ballads of the American Indian , a concept album released by Cash focusing the harsh and unfair treatment of Native Americans in the US .
Part of the inspiration for Cash had been his belief that he had Cherokee ancestry , but years later , after researching his family tree , he discovered his ancestors actually came from Britain and Ireland .
Dylan 's Greenwich village colleague , folk singer Peter La Farge penned the lyrics .
They concern the flooding of the Allegheny Resevoir and the ensuing loss of Seneca nation land on the Pennsylvania/New York border in the early 1960s .
La Farge later wrote and recorded his own version of the song as `` The Senecas -LRB- As Long as The Grass shall Grow -RRB- . ''
Bob Dylan wrote the music and performed `` The Grass Shall Grow '' at a 1962 Carnegie Hall `` hootenanny '' hosted by Pete Seeger as a means of introducing new talent .
Dylan has yet to get round to recording the song .
Cash re-recorded the song decades later as a duet with June Carter Cash .
He altered the lyrics to describe his relationship with and devotion to his duet partner .
The track itself can be found on his 2003 boxset Unearthed .
