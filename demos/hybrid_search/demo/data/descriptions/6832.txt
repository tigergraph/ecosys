This song was suggested by Hail To The King producer , Mike Elizondo .
Guitarist Synyster Gates explained to MusicRadar.com : `` He wanted us to do something upbeat , but we wanted to make sure that it did n't get hokey -- we 've done upbeat before , and sometimes things can get a little too cutesy and sugary .
Our goal was to have a darker , more serious tone , which can get lost when you increase the tempo . ''
`` It 's very adventurous , '' he added , `` but it maintains that upbeat vibe .
There 's some great drumming on it , and I 'm really excited about the guitar work .
The solo is big .
Instead of doing a vocal bridge , we decided to do one with the guitar and have it take you places .
I think it fits with the imagery of the lyrics , which are very personal but still presented in a way that people can relate to it .
The words are very ` storyteller-y , ' concerning travel and endeavors , but they 're not necessarily concerned with present time .
The guitar stuff goes hand-in-hand with all of that . ''
This is a tour song .
Vocalist M. Shadows explained to Kerrang !
magazine : `` Things in it that may seem over-the-top are things that we 've experienced that we 've put a little Life Of Pi twist on .
We 're telling a little bit of a grander story out of things that have actually happened . ''
He added : `` When I say , ` Standing in Hell , ' that 's a reference to the band being in Iraq in 126 Fahrenheit heat and standing in Saddam Hussein 's palace .
That 's a place that many people in this world never get to experience , but we use the metaphor of ` Standing in Hell , staring the Devil in the eyes ' looking at Saddam 's picture on the wall . '
That is the Devil to some people .
There are quite a few stories in there about things we 've done around the world but , at the end of the day , all you want to do is come home and be with all your loved ones . ''
