`` Hey Baby , Here 's That Song You Wanted '' is the first song that lead singer Beau Bokan wrote for the Blessthefall .
When the band was searching for their new singer , they asked Bokan to record vocals for a demo track they sent him .
The verse and chorus so impressed the band that it led to a studio trial and invitation to join the band .
This song was fleshed out into `` Hey Baby , Here 's That Song You Wanted . ''
The song appears on Blessedthefall 's 2009 sophomore album , Witness .
Beau said that the album was very personal for him .
The singer lost a lot of loved ones over the years before recording it , and explained that much of that pent-up emotion was finally released in songs written for the album .
The lyrics revolve around Bokan lamenting a crumbling relationship , and wondering if he can still save it .
By the end of the song , he decides that something can be salvaged , and ponders what gesture he can make to set things right .
This suggests that the song is self-referencing ; written about the experience that led Bokan to write it .
`` Hey Baby , Here 's That Song You Wanted '' was released as downloadable content for Rock Band on the Xbox 360 .
