The `` Monty '' in this song is the the actor Montgomery Clift , who starred in The Misfits , From Here to Eternity , and A Place in the Sun .
But unlike other songs about him -LRB- see the Clash 's `` The Right Profile '' -RRB- , this one does n't specifically mention his last name , his movies or his pill and alcohol problems .
Michael Stipe wrote the lyrics to be more of a contemplation on movies vs. reality .
According to Craig Rosen 's R.E.M. Inside Out - The Stories behind the Songs , Peter Buck composed the music on a bouzouki in a hotel room in New Orleans .
While he composed it , there was a quite amorous -LRB- read : loud -RRB- couple in a adjoining room .
-LRB- thanks , Martin - Rostock , Germany -RRB- Michael Stipe got the idea for this song after speaking with a photographer who took pictures of Clift when he was filming The Misfits .
