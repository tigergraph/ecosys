After taking several years long break to pursue solo careers , Irish rock band The Cranberries reunited in 2009 .
Following a North America and European tour the quartet recorded their sixth studio album , Roses at the Metalworks Studios in Toronto -LRB- Canada -RRB- with producer Stephen Street , who previously collaborated with the band on their first , second and fifth sets .
This is the first single from the album .
The song finds frontwoman Dolores O'Riordan reflecting on how we should follow our instincts more and was inspired by real-life concerns of parenthood and mortality .
`` It 's about the way we sometimes hyper over-escalate things in our minds , overthink things when sometimes spontaneity and just jumping in is better , '' she explained to Billboard magazine .
`` Tomorrow you might not have that moment back again .
So it 's really about moving on and also about kind of looking at the younger generation and how they worry about all kinds of silly things .
They do n't think they 're silly , but when you 're older you know better . ''
