This heartbreaking number is the second single to be released from Alan Jackson 's first album for his own label , Alan 's Country Records .
Nashville songwriter Jay Knowles and Jackson 's nephew , Adam Wright , wrote the song .
Other cuts penned by the pair include `` No Truck , No Boat , No Girl , '' a track from Joe Nichols ' 2011 album , It 's All Good .
Jackson told The Boot that he knew as soon as he heard the song he had discovered something special .
`` Well , at first it raised the hair on my arms , when I heard the demo , '' he recalled .
`` It was a really good version , too .
It was one of those songs that , when I heard it , it 's the kind of song that made me want to be in country music .
I 'm such a big fan of that kind of song .
Sad songs , or break-up songs , and heartache songs are always the best ones to bring that emotion out and are actually the easiest to write as a writer . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Steve Goldmann and was filmed on a cold winter 's day at Coney Island 's beach and amusement park .
