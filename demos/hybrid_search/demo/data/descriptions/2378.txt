Edens Edge mandolin and banjo player Cherrill Green said regarding this Terry Clayton , Brett James and Ashley Monroe penned cut : '' ` Swingin ' Door ' is a song that we found when we first moved to Nashville .
We all fell in love with the song and the pure country feel it had .
We started playing it out and realized that people at the shows were really connecting to it .
We knew it was one we absolutely had to include on the album ! ''
Lead vocalist Hannah Blaylock commented regarding the meaning of this positive anthem : `` I love it because it 's an empowering song .
It 's from a girl 's perspective obviously , but it could also be from a boy 's perspective .
It 's about being in a relationship and not letting somebody else push you around .
I know we 've all felt that way . ''
