This `` let 's get wasted at the club '' fist-pumper finds Minaj singing about filling her `` glass up a little more '' before getting up and burning `` this floor '' as a preliminary to a one-night stand .
Some critics have claimed this song is similar sounding to Pink Friday : Roman Reloaded 's lead single , `` Starships . ''
However Swedish/Moroccan hitmaker RedOne , who produced both tracks told MTV News that `` Pound the Alarm '' is sonically edgier .
`` It 's got the pop element , but it 's got some hard-core elements , some dance underground elements , '' he said .
Here 's one for the trivia geeks amongst you .
The Queens Park Savannah is purported to be the largest roundabout in the world .
It occupies about 260 acres of level land , and the distance around the perimeter is about 2.2 miles .
Nicki warns her man , `` I 'm a bad bitch , no muzzle , '' meaning that whilst muzzles prevent dogs from barking , nobody can stop her from saying what she wants to say , as she is a ` bad bitch . '
The song 's carnival themed music video was filmed at Queens Park Savannah in Port Of Spain , the town where Minaj was born .
It was directed by Benny Boom , who previously filmed the singer 's `` Beez In The Trap '' and `` Right By My Side '' clips .
