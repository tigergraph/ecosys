Griffin writes about her feelings over unwanted and abused animals in this haunting tune .
She penned the song sometime after seeing a dog running loose by the interstate as she returned home to Texas from Nashville .
`` I looked out onto the median strip and there was this big , big brown pit bull , just darting down the middle , '' Griffin recalled to Country Weekly .
`` It just took my breath away because it was so beautiful .
I just kept driving for a second , then I thought to myself , ` Wow , that dog 's done for . ' ''
The album American Kid features a number of other songs about death , mostly in reference to her father .
This song looks at the topic from a different angle , as Griffin sees a dog on the highway and knows that nothing good will come from it .
The metaphor acts as a thin wall between a song about an actual dog and the loss of faith in the wake of devastation .
