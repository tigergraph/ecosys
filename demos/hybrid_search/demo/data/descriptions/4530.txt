Invisible Empire/Crescent Moon was produced by Tunstall with the American singer-songwriter , musician and record producer Howe Gelb .
The pair first met after they were both invited by Robyn Hitchcock to join a touring show called The Floating Palace .
She and Gelb hit it off , `` He 's just such good fun , '' said Tunstall .
`` He 's mischievous and he 's a maverick and he 's got a great bad attitude towards convention and is musically very exciting . ''
Gelb invited Tunstall to record in his studio in Tucson , Arizona .
She recorded Invisible Empire/Crescent Moon there during two separate sessions in April and November 2012 .
This woozy , hypnotic blues tune emerged during their first period .
`` It 's about basically knowing your potential , '' explained Tunstall , `` knowing you 're great , but not being able to see it through because of your own insecurities and not feeling a support system around you . ''
