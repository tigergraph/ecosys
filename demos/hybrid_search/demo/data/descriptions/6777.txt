Nelly -LRB- born Cornell Haynes Jr. -RRB- had an itinerant childhood , moving to Spain and then to the ghettos of St. Louis , Missouri .
He achieved local underground success with rap outfit St. Lunatics in 1996 , before going solo in 1999 .
This Country-meets-Hip-Hop tune was his debut solo single .
Nelly told the story of the song in an interview with XXL magazine : `` It was a beat that I had got from one of our producers at the time JE .
I loved the beat but I do n't think everybody in the group was as excited about the beat as I was .
So I took it to one of the most historic clubs in -LSB- East -RSB- St. Louis .
It was called Club Casino .
I took it over there the same night and we had a DJ that had been supporting us previously up to that point and his name was DJ 618 .
He put it on right away and from that moment , you know what I 'm saying , people was like , ` Boom , boom , boom ' and the s -- t just blew up from there , you know . ''
The song 's melody was taken from the playground song , `` Roller Coaster '' .
A radio friendly version was also recorded , in which the word `` s -- t '' is backmasked , and most of the explicit words are replaced by cleaner versions and/or bleep-related sound effects .
