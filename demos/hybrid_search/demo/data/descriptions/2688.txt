This is the first single released by American singer-songwriter Ester Dean .
After some success co-writing hit songs for other artists , including `` Never Ever '' for Ciara and `` Whatcha Think About That '' for the Pussycat Dolls , Zone 4 CEO Polow Da Don signed Dean up for his label as a solo artist .
This song features on the soundtrack of the Lebron James documentary , More than a Game .
Dean revealed to the L.A. Times that the song was originally intended for Ciara , but later caught the attention of Britney Spears .
She explained : `` Drop It Low , ' honestly , was for Ciara , but she did n't come get the song .
Then Britney wanted it .
`` Dean added that when neither artist ended up taking the song , Polow convinced the songwriter to record it herself .
`` During the demo -LSB- Polow -RSB- kept telling me , ` You 've got ta believe it ' as I was singing it .
A week later he asked if I wanted to hear my new single . ''
The song features R&B singer-songwriter Chris Brown 's vocal on the hook .
It was his first appearance on the Hot 100 after his charge for assaulting his then girlfriend , Rihanna .
The video features Dean and Brown as well as cameos by Keri Hilson , Nelly , LeBron James , Soulja Boy and Polow Da Don .
The director , Joseph Kahn , had worked with Brown previously on his Forever promo .
