The second single from Kid Cudi 's sophomore album , Man on the Moon II : The Legend of Mr. Rager , finds him rapping on a single note over piano arpeggios .
Cudi produced the chilled-out track with Dot da Genius and Mike Dean .
The video was directed , shot and edited by Cudi 's actor pal Shia LaBeouf and produced by Lorenzo Eduardo while the rapper was in Amsterdam serving as a judge for the 2010 Cannabis Cup .
LaBeouf originally reached out to Cudi as he wanted to shoot a short film centered around `` MANIAC . ''
`` While we were brainstorming that , I had the gig to perform in Amsterdam .
I was thinking about ways to do a video for ` Marijuana ' because I knew I wanted to do something and I wanted to do the right thing , '' Cudi told MTV News . ''
And it just hit me one day , like , ` Yo , I can have Shia come with me and film the whole trip and we could do it like a real vintage documentary style of the entire trip . '
What could be iller than that ?
`` The video shows Cudi and his friend Cage in Amsterdam smoking exotic strains of weed .
The clip confused some fans as the hip hop performer had announced a couple of months previously that he had given up smoking grass .
Cudi told MTV News nothing has changed .
`` It 's something I did before I decided to quit smoking marijuana , '' he explained .
`` However , I did n't want to deprive people of the footage , deprive people of the video because of my personal decisions .
It was almost like an R.I.P. video to my whole smoking career . ''
The week that Man on the Moon II was released , sufficient downloads of this track were made to enable it to reach # 54 on the Hot 100 .
