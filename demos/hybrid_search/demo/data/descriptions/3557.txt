This was the second single from American Christian rock band Skillet 's eighth studio album , Awake .
Cooper expanded on the song to Christianity Today magazine : `` In a theological sense , the song is about original sin .
You are born into the human race , you 're guilty or sinful , no matter what you hope to be .
`` Monster '' is about the fact that there is somebody we know we do n't want to be .
Some people call it the old man or the old self .
That guy wants to creep out when you 're driving and somebody cuts you off .
You wonder as a Christian , how do I keep it at bay ?
I liken it to the idea of a '50s horror film of this beast inside you coming alive . ''
Frontman John Cooper explained to StereoTruth.net : `` It 's a song about being fake and putting on a face for people that 's not the real you .
But it 's basically about the nature of sin and the nature of the divine , which is the duel nature we have as Christians .
Everyday we have to strive to throw away the old and be that new person in Christ . ''
This song was used as the theme for the 2009 edition WWE pay-per-view `` Hell in a Cell . ''
It is also featured in WWE video game Smackdown vs Raw 2010 and was used in the NBC telecast of Wrestlemania 25 , highlighting WWE wrestler Randy Orton 's quest to become the WWE champion .
