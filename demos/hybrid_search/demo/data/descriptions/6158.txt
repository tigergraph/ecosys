During an interview with Jim Shearer on VH1 's Big Morning Buzz Live , singer Isaac Slade revealed that this song was inspired by a road trip he and his then girlfriend , now wife , Anna took from Denver , Colorado to Los Angeles .
They attempted a shortcut through a mountain range and as a consequence got lost and ended up 600 miles off course ; as Isaac Slade put it '' ... -LSB- we were -RSB- two states in and forty-eight states to go . ''
The Fray were originally not going to include this diary of a road trip on Scars & Stories as they did n't want to have more than 11 tracks on the album .
However after King played the song to a friend telling him it was going to be scrapped , his pal told him , `` Dude , you 've got to be crazy not to put that on the record . ''
So King emailed his band colleagues to say they needed to include the song on the LP .
Guitarist Joe King also took a road trip with his two daughters to the West Coast in the summer of 2011 .
He recalled to Denver Westword : `` We both had had these major road trip experiences , and we started talking about it and we just started writing about it , that idea of a road trip and what that does , and the memories it creates . ''
