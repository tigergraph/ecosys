Vocalist and primary lyricist Max Bemis told Alternative Press : `` This is a song about death and how love relates to death , and the fear of death .
It 's kind of about how finding love alleviated my fear of death or my fear of growing old .
It was a statement of recognizing my soul 's link to -LSB- wife -RSB- Sherri 's .
It 's about how when you really love someone and it 's deep in your soul , after you die the soul endures and that love will burn on .
If everything was stripped away and I had to answer after I die - consciously affirm the most important thing in my life -- it would be Sherri , the defining thing in my life . ''
