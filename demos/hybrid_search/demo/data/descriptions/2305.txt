This is the opening track from Virginia hip hop duo Clipse 's third studio album , Till The Casket Drops .
Clipse comprises of brothers Malice -LRB- Gene Thornton -RRB- and Pusha T -LRB- Terrence Thornton -RRB- .
Pusha told MTV News that this is a `` redemption song . ''
He added : `` It 's an apology , it gives a rhyme and reason for some of the things and some of the attitudes of the Clipse .
It says ` sorry ' just as much as it says we 're better -LSB- than other rappers -RSB- , and we 're still the best ... ever .
`` MTV asked Pusha what they 're apologizing for in this song .
He replied : `` Nothing musically .
This is our lives .
This music has affected a lot of people and lot of lives around us .
Once we get from in front of the camera , there 's a whole world out there that we 're a part of : family , friends , streets .
It 's a lot that goes on and a lot that goes on behind this . ''
