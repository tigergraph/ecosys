This is the closing track of The Harrow & The Harvest , bluegrass singer-songwriter Gillian Welch 's fifth studio album and her first for eight years .
As with all of her previous releases , it is a collaboration with her musical partner David Rawlings .
Welch told Q magazine the song `` is this continuous tapestry of reversal , as happens in life .
Anyone who 's been around for any chunk of time knows that if you 're down it 's going to change and if you 're up it 's going to change . ''
