The group 's drummer Zac Hanson told us : `` What ` Penny And Me ' talks about is how music weaves through your life and how important it is .
How it ties in all your friends and loved ones , whether it 's a wife or girlfriend or whatever , it 's always Penny And Me , you 're always bringing these people with you through the music you listen to .
It 's really a love song to music in a lot of ways , just the importance of what great music does , whether it 's the song you dance to on your wedding night or that great album you listened to on a road trip with your friends , it 's something that you really relate your life to , through what you heard , albums and songs . ''
Zac : `` That song has been written for a little while .
This whole album process for the album Underneath , it took a while .
There were a lot of songs written , and we got to the end of this process and we really felt like we had n't finished the album without that song , so we went back in and we recorded that song .
That capped off the album and we said , ` Hey , it 's done . '
What it 's talking about is that love of music and the importance of it .
What it does throughout your life is something we wanted on the album . ''
