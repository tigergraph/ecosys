Legend told Billboard magazine that this song , where he does n't want a one night stand to end , is his favorite cut from Evolver .
This track features twice on Evolver .
The album opens with an instrumental version and the full cut closes the set .
Legend told Billboard : `` My songs are always about love and devotion .
` Good Morning ' is about sex more explicitly than I 've written about before .
Sooner or later I had to go R. Kelly on my fans ... without going all the way . ''
