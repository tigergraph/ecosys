This southern Country-Rock track finds Keith unable to avoid the temptations of a voodoo mistress .
He explained to Billboard magazine that the song is about , `` a guy stopping in a bar in Louisiana and getting taken up to a girl 's room ... and she puts the mojo on him and curses him . ''
Toby Keith discussed on the press release for That Do n't Make Me a Bad Guy this song written by himself and Bobby Pinson : `` I always wanted to write one of these kinds of songs , but we really did n't have an idea for a title .
We started writing and somewhere along the way we decided we were dealing with a Creole woman witch doctor .
We ended with the cry of the Creole woman as our centerpiece .
It 's a story about a lost outlaw running from whatever .
He happens through Louisiana and figures he 'll have a quick night of romance and move on down the road , but he bites off more than he can chew . ''
