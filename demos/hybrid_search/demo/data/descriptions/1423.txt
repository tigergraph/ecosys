Some people who are not familiar with Ke $ ha 's background were surprised that she ditched her familiar synths and autotune for this Country-style cut about how simple her life was before she became a Pop star .
However , her fans realized immediately that the tune serves as an ode to the songstress ' adolescent years in Nashville .
Ke $ ha was raised in the Music City by her songwriter mom who earned her corn penning country hits for the likes of Dolly Parton -LRB- `` Old Flames -LRB- Ca n't Hold a Candle to You -RRB- . '' -RRB-
Ke $ ha returned to Nashville to write this piano-tinged song with her mother whilst Patrick Carney plays drums on the track .
The `` TiK ToK '' singer and The Black Keys stickman have been close buddies for a while .
She told Spin magazine : `` He 's a close friend .
I really wanted to capture that essence that my mom used to talk about - all my favorite records were made of people being friends and jamming and making music in an organic , spontaneous way , and I wanted to capture as much of that in a pop record as I could . ''
