Atoms For Peace formed in October 2009 as a performance-based collaboration between Radiohead vocalist Thom Yorke , Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea , longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich , drummer Joey Waronker and percussionist Mauro Refosco .
The group was put together by Yorke to play live the songs from his laptop-driven 2006 solo album , The Eraser .
They toured briefly in early 2010 and performed at that year 's Coachella Music & Arts Festival .
So good were they in rehearsal that Yorke arranged for three days of studio recording in Los Angeles , after the last concert .
This is the band 's first official collaborative song , which they debuted on October 2 , 2009 when the band played their first shows in Los Angeles .
The song 's title is partially shared with Radiohead 's Hail to The Thief track `` Myxomatosis .
-LRB- Judge , Jury , and Executioner . -RRB- '' .
Asked by Rolling Stone how much the music determined his lyric direction in the song , Yorke replied : '' ` Judge , Jury and Executioner ' was a funny one , because the rhythm is so odd on it .
The phrase just spewed out when I was playing the song on guitar .
It was like a key , opening a door into all this other stuff that was going on , that I was desperate to get out .
` Judge , Jury and Executioner ' -- that 's pretty angry . ''
