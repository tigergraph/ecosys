This is a single taken from Country singer Tim McGraw 's greatest hits collection , Number One Hits .
The song was written by two sets of brothers - Brett Warren and Brad Warren and Brett and Jim Beavers .
Jim Beavers and Brett Warren told The Boot the story behind this song : Jim Beavers : My brother Brett had this crazy idea that he and I should start writing with The Warren Brothers just to see what would happen .
We dubbed ourselves `` The Warren Beavers , '' and the very first song we wrote was ` Felt Good on My Lips .
` Brett Warren : It started with a bass riff that Jim began to play .
Then we started spitting out some ideas .
Brad and I started singing the `` oh oh oh ah '' part , and it really unfolded quickly.Jim Beavers : I thought the song was one of the weirdest things I had ever heard .
That `` oh oh oh ah '' part came out of nowhere , but we vowed when we started writing that we would n't worry about Music Row songwriting convention .
We wrote the song like a band , so the music , groove and instrumentation were as much a part of the tune as the lyrics or idea .
One unusual thing was that I played bass on everything as we were writing , which I have never played in my life before .
I think the unconventional approach to the writing made the songs that much more unique .
We ended up going in the studio and recording all the songs pretty much live .
It was a blast .
Not musical perfection by any means , but vibe perfection .
