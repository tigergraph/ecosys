Chesney owns two Sea Rays , a 56 and a 60-footer , and in his spare time he is most likely out on the water in one of his boats .
This song , which he co-wrote with Dean Dillon and Scotty Emerick pays tribute to his love of being out on the ocean .
The song includes the lyric , `` vessels of freedom/harbors of healing , '' which is how Chesney feels when he 's riding the waves .
`` That line came from a gentleman and his daughter I met in St. Croix , '' he explained in the June 2011 issue of Boating magazine .
`` I think anybody who has a boat has an emotional attachment to it .
It has a way of healing a person and gives him a sense of freedom .
That 's where I feel the most freedom - and it 's helped me heal something that needed healing . ''
