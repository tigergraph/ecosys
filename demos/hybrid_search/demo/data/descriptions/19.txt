`` You ca n't see California without Marlon Brando 's eyes '' is a quote lead singer Corey Taylor took from a homeless guy on the street while he was in California .
The guy was just saying it over and over again .
-LRB- thanks , Ryan - Lutz , FL -RRB- This song has been covered by English Deathcore band Bring Me The Horizon and is often included in their live set .
-LRB- thanks , Alex - Lancaster , England -RRB- The song was partly inspired by Corey 's father , as seen in the phrase `` I am my father 's son , cause he 's a phantom , a mystery , and that leaves me nothing ! ''
