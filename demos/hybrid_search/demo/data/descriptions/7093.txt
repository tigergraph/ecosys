This was recorded at Keith Richards ' villa in the South of France while The Stones were on their `` exile '' to avoid taxes in England .
The band would often sleep most of the day , go to the casinos in nearby Monte Carlo , then work on the album until morning .
The lyrics are very difficult to understand , maybe because they 're very random .
In an interview with Uncut Magazine April 2010 , Mick Jagger was asked about the lyric `` million dollar sad . ''
He replied : `` That song was done in cut-ups .
It 's in the style of William Burroughs , and so-on .
` Million Dollar Sad ' does n't mean anything .
We did it in LA in the studio .
We just wrote phrases on bits of paper and cut them up .
The Burroughs style .
And then you throw them into a hat , pick them out and assemble them into verses .
We did it for one number , but it worked .
We probably did it ` cos we could n't think of anything to write . ''
Bobby Keys played the sax solo .
He joined The Stones in France and became a major contributor to the album .
Richards , The Stones ' rhythm guitarist , played bass on this .
