This is the second single from American R&B and soul artist Alicia Keys ' fourth studio album , The Element of Freedom .
During an appearance on BET 's 106 & Park , Keys announced this song would be the follow-up single to `` Does n't Mean Anything . ''
She added : `` Big up to Jeff Bhasker for that one .
It 's gon na take you on an ascension and I wan na take you higher . ''
A certain Minneapolis singer-songwriter was an inspiration for this song . ''
There was such a Prince element to it , Keys told Entertainment Weekly in 2012 , `` that quiet Prince place , where you know you could sing at the top of your lungs , but it 's more powerful to be in this whispery zone .
And that emotion of trying to get over somebody , it hurts so bad .
Every time you tell yourself , ` This is it !
I 'm gon na be over it and over you . '
And then you 're not . ''
This song was helmed by Grammy-winning producer Jeff Bhasker -LRB- Kanye West , Jay-Z -RRB- .
Asked by Artist Direct how he likes to set up the atmosphere to get the `` best take , '' Bhasker replied that `` as a preliminary thing , '' he likes to `` vibe out '' and `` get to know them . ''
It started with this song when Keys invited him out to dinner so they could get to know each other , before they worked together .
`` I take a good cue from that and try to spend the first day vibing out , '' he explained .
`` It makes it so much easier .
You can actually get so much more done after that .
They have to trust me first .
That 's the biggest thing .
They have to trust where I 'm coming from and what I 'm saying .
We have to get know each other , and then we can get the best out . ''
Keys told The Sun November 13 , 2009 : `` I just love that song .
I 'm excited about that song as I just love the way it 's pushing things forward .
It 's a great representation of where I am now .
I can play it with tons of music behind me or I can play it with just the piano .
Either way it touches , you get it .
I 'm so very excited by that record . ''
One key rule that producer Jeff Bhasker follows is to keep things positive .
He told American Songwriter magazine : `` The trick is to put your emotion into it while keeping it upbeat .
My first hit was Alicia Keys ' ` Try Sleeping With a Broken Heart , ' and it 's a sad song but the chorus says ` Tonight I 'm gon na find a way to make it without you , ' so it 's little things like that . ''
`` Music and pop songs should have a positive message , '' he added .
`` There 's a power in music to heal people and give them a good feeling .
From the greatest songs like ` Let It Be ' or ` Imagine ' or ` Man In The Mirror . '
it 's always about spinning something in a positive way .
That 's been an important thing for me . ''
