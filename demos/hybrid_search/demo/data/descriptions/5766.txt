Having been the first artist signed by Jay-Z to his Roc Nation label then getting a verse on Jay-Z 's 2009 The Blueprint 3 track , `` A Star Is Born , '' North Carolina rapper J. Cole was hoping he might get the CEO to lend his voice to his debut album .
This was the cut he had in mind and he purposely left an empty slot at the end in the hope that Hova would get on it .
Instead , it was another track , `` Mr. Nice Watch '' that would bear his boss 's bars .
Cole recalled to Artist Direct : `` I made that song one day in my room .
I find I make most of my best songs in my bedroom and I made that one day at the house , in my room .
I thought I was going to make something and then throw it out to my fans when I was done with my album , but I made that beat and made that song in a few hours .
It was too special to just throw it out there , so I decided to keep it for my album . ''
The song finds the rising North Carolina MC recalling his early days when Jay would n't even accept his demo CD and celebrating his subsequent success .
Cole was going to offer the song to his fans as a free download , but after he made the beat at his home , he knew he had something good .
`` I actually did the song thinking I would just throw it out when I made it , '' he said of the track .
`` I made it in my crib and I was like , ` Man I 'm gon na throw something out today , or tomorrow whatever , let me do a song . '
Then I started making it , and as soon as I made it , I was like , ` Oh nah , nah . ' ''
