Gloriana 's Tom Gossin penned this song with former Epic Records artist Stephanie Bentley and Nashville songwriter James Slater .
Bentley also co-wrote Gloriana 's breakthrough single `` Wild At Heart . ''
The song 's music video was filmed at Silverado 's in Nashville , which resembles the bar in Wilmington , North Carolina , where Tom Gossin first met his fianc√©e Jaime .
The clip represents the many break-ups and make-ups they went through before they finally got engaged .
`` My career broke us up , '' he told People magazine .
`` Long distance was tough .
-LSB- But -RSB- it turned out for the better . ''
Gloriana performed the song on the season 2 finale of The CW 's Hart of Dixie on May 7 , 2013 .
Gossin -LRB- from Billboard magazine -RRB- : `` The song is about dealing with a break-up where you are still living in the same town and running in the same circle of friends .
There 's no communication but you 're suffering inside .
You want to know what the other person is doing but you do n't want to look like you want to know .
You go to the places where you used to hang out and hope that they do n't walk in with someone else .
The song is about not being able to shake somebody and realizing that maybe you have found the person that you need to work things out with . ''
Vocalist Rachel Reinert told Billboard magazine why the trio feel this song has struck a chord with people .
`` Everyone knows what it 's like to go through a heartbreak or end a relationship for whatever reason , '' she explained .
`` Not being able to shake their memory . ''
