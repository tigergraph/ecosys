This is one of the few songs on Imaginaerum that does n't include an orchestra or choir .
Instead it features English multi-instrumentalist former Iona member Troy Donockley on uilleann pipes and Finnish classical and jazz violinist Pekka Kuusisto on violin .
According to Nightwish keyboardist and chief songwriter , Tuomas Holopainen , this is one of the more approachable songs of Imaginaerum on first listen .
