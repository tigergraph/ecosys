When Our Lady Peace was writing this song , frontman Raine Maida suggested that they needed to do something different at the end .
At first , the band did n't know if it would be a guitar solo , vocal solo , or something else , but they knew it had to be something they had n't done before .
Maida asked guitarist Steve Mazur to put some guitar solos over the end of the song , and as Mazur puts it , `` that 's what seemed to fit the mood of that part of the song . ''
Steve Mazur says this is one of two songs off Curve that he 's the most proud of -LRB- the other is `` If This Is It '' -RRB- .
The guitarist told us he likes these two songs because they 're very dynamic and that the band wanted to become more and more dynamic as the years progressed , even though they knew they were taking a chance by doing that .
In 2012 , OLP guitarist Steve Mazur told us that the solo he rips into at the end of the song is `` not something we 've done in the past . ''
Mazur says the song goes off into new territory where it changes key and uses different chords that the band is n't used to .
When the recording was done , OLP was surprised with the results and Mazur describes listening back to the solo as `` very exciting . ''
