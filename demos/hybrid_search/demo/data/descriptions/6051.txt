This is about people who go on daytime television talk shows and cry about how messed up their lives are just to get the attention .
These shows proliferated in the early '90s , with people like Geraldo Rivera , Vicki Lawrence , Gordon Elliott , Marilu Henner and Carnie Wilson all getting their own shows .
This is in addition to Maury Povitch , Jerry Springer and Oprah .
This was one of 4 new songs on the Eagles reunion album .
After breaking up in 1982 , they got back together for a tour that set records for high ticket prices .
In the line , `` The more I think about it old Billy was right , let 's kill all the lawyers , kill 'em tonight , '' Henley is referring to William Shakespeare .
