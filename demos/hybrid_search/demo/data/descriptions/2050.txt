The band 's drummer Nick Hodgson is the vocalist on this ballad .
Kaiser Chief bassist Simon Rix told Drowned in Sound about the recording of this song : `` We played it through in the rehearsal room a few times : Me on bass , Peanut on drums and Nick singing and guitaring .
We recorded it like that in Old Chapel and liked it .
We knew it was n't finished but we did n't want to ruin it by overcomplicating or over-thinking it .
We never played it again until we did it in the studio .
Nick kept the same drum beat as Peanut had done on the demo because we thought that was very important to the feel of the song .
He used tea-towels on the drums and they were mic ` ed very closely to get more of a sixties sound .
A lot of good albums are like a night out , starting with getting ready and going out and reaching a peak and then going home and the night winding down .
That 's why this song is really important on the album and is the last song . ''
