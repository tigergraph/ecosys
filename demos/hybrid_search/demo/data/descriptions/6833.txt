Bowie closes The Next Day with this haunting ballad concerning someone searching for their own identity in a prison setting .
Producer Tony Visconti admitted to Rolling Stone `` I 'm not quite sure what he 's singing about on it , but it 's a classic Bowie ballad .
He 's singing in his handsomest voice , a very deep , very sonorous voice .
And I ca n't give too much away about it because honestly , I do n't know exactly what it 's about , if it 's about being in a real prison or being imprisoned in your mind .
Again , it 's certainly not about him ; he 's singing as the voice of somebody . ''
Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima is name checked in the song .
Bowie 's Berlin apartment was decorated with a painted portrait of the avant-garde writer , who is remembered for his ritual suicide after a failed coup d'Ã©tat .
