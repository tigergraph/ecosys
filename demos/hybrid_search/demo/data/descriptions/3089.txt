Frontman Jonathan Higgs told NME : `` I wrote this on the tour bus , on a laptop .
It had a dreamy 10cc feel . ''
Bassist Jeremy Pritchard added : `` Then we changed it for a Craig David rhythm . ''
Regarding the song 's meaning , Higgs told The Line Of Best Fit that the lyrics are a metaphor `` about depression and feeling like there 's no point in doing anything or that you 're not going to achieve anything . ''
He explained : '' I 've always been fascinated by the fact that all animal embryos are the same and then they turn into elephants or dolphins or whatever but there 's that point where they 're all the same and all have the potential to be ` the thing ' .
The story is one of those ... a fish egg just drifting along and thinking what am I going to be ?
Am I going to be the dolphin of your dreams ?
I could be a lion or a whale .
But I 'm probably not going to .
Just drifting along in the darkness . ''
