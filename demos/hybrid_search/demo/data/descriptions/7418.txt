The original title was , `` My Name Is David Ruffin And These Are The Temptations , '' which is a reference to how Ruffin tried to change the Temptations ' name to `` David Ruffin and The Temptations , '' which Motown had done with `` Diana Ross and The Supremes . ''
Ruffin overestimated his popularity and was fired from the group in 1968 when he alienated his band mates with his ego and histrionics .
Although he was a very talented singer and performed lead vocals on many of The Temptations hits , the group went on without him and had several more hits ; Ruffin died of a cocaine overdose in 1991 .
The song is a warning about the trappings of fame , and if Fall Out Boy kept the original title , they would have risked a lawsuit from Ruffin 's estate .
