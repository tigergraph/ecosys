This David Lee Murphy and Rodney Clawson penned ballad finds Jason Aldean singing of a guy warning a girl that he might not be the right boyfriend for her .
Aldean told Billboard magazine : `` That song is what a lot of guys probably should say to girls if the girl 's into them or whatever , ` I 'm gon na save you some trouble here and give you a heads up : you do not wan na hang out with me .
You are hot , and I 'm all about it , but you 're probably not gon na like me tomorrow . '
That 's what that song 's about , ` if you knew what was good for you , you would n't be hanging around very much , '' Aldean explains .
`` It 's probably what guys should say to girls but do n't , so a girl would probably appreciate a guy telling them that .
As a father , I can appreciate it . ''
