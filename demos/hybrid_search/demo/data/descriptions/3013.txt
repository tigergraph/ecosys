Joel left little doubt that this song was a scathing attack on his former manager and ex-brother-in-law Frank Weber , who he had been battling in the courts for four years .
In a great example of why you should n't do business with family , Joel put Weber in charge of his finances and then accused him of mismanaging his money .
In this song , Joel sings about how he and Weber could have made it to the Great Wall of China if Weber had just believed in him .
The reason Joel chose the Great Wall for this metaphor was becausehe had already been to Cuba and Russia , and felt that China was still a great unknown for Westerners .
