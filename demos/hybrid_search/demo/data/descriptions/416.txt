This is the second single from Beirut-born London based pop singer-songwriter Mika 's second album , The Boy Who Knew Too Much .
Mika commented to The Daily Mail September 4 , 2009 about this song : `` When you 're a teenager , you blame things on everyone .
Bill Gates said only losers blame their parents .
By that reckoning , I 'm a loser . ''
Mika told Q magazine June 2009 about this song with Cuban pianos and a swaggering hip-hop production : `` This sounds like No Doubt . ''
He added : `` It 's about a wealthy , handsome boy who has everything , yet pretends to be miserable . ''
This was a # 1 on the Japanese Hot 100 , provided by Billboard .
It was only the second international single to achieve this feat -LRB- Leona Lewis ' `` Bleeding Love '' was the other one -RRB- since the survey 's start in March 2008 .
