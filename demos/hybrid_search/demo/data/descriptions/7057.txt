This is a single from Charlotte Church 's first EP , One .
She premiered the song on BBC Radio with Bethan Elfyn on June 26 , 2012 .
Church told Q magazine : `` It was inspired by the Nabokov novel Pale Fire .
In it , he explores this idea of living in a temporal plane where all the people you have known are there .
You have to make peace with all the people you have ever known .
Whether you do or not makes your life heaven or hell .
Making peace with yourself and others is a huge theme . ''
Russian native writer Vladimir Nabokov is best known for Lolita , his story about a middle-aged literature professor 's obsession with a 12-year-old girl .
The classic novel has inspired a number of songs in the pop canon , the best known being The Police 's hit tune about a teacher who lusts after one of his students , `` Do n't Stand So Close To Me . ''
