This digital single is taken from singer-songwriter Jason Reeves ' album , Lovesick .
The song was released on February 15 , 2011 .
Speaking about the album , Reeves told us : `` The idea is really that we are all the lovesick .
Not just me , but I would absolutely include myself in that .
There is n't a song with the title , but every song definitely follows that theme .
It 's kind of a story , from song to song through the album , it pretty much follows the actual story of my life while I was writing it .
And you kind of just have to listen to it to see what happens .
But it 's a very beautiful and tragic thing .
And The Lovesick is not necessarily all bad .
It sounds bad , but it 's meant to mean both good and bad things . ''
Reeves explained the song 's meaning in publicity materials : `` It 's a twisted take on a classic children 's rhyme .
It 's strength and defiance in the face of a lover 's disintegration .
It 's armor for a fragile heart and an anthem for the breaking unbroken . ''
Reeves wrote the tune with Danelle Leverett , who is one half the Country duo The JaneDear Girls , and with fellow Sony songwriter Jordan Lawhead .
The threesome also penned the track `` Free Ride '' for The JaneDear Girls self-titled debut album .
