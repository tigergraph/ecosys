In this song Christina Aguilera recalls how her wedding day brought an unanticipated moment of sadness when she realized that she did n't have a father to walk her down the aisle .
Christina 's parents divorced when she was 8 years old after years of alleged physical and emotional abuse .
Back to Basics featured 20s , 30s and 40s-style jazz and blues with a modern twist .
Old-school music was a refuge for Aguilera during her difficult early years .
She explained to The Daily Telegraph May 7 , 2010 .
`` Soul and blues spoke to me at an age where many would think I was too young to appreciate it .
Six years old and I was listening to Billie Holiday as if it was the world to me .
I related to blues and soul because I never had a safe haven growing up .
It was a very chaotic environment for me to grow up in . ''
Christina Aguilera recalled her wedding day in an interview with USA Weekend magazine August 6 , 2006 : `` I figured I 'd just walk myself down the aisle , but I never realized how nervous you get when the big day comes .
When it came time to walk down the aisle , I was shaking , and I realized how amazing it would 've felt to have a man holding my arm to give me away to this next man in my life .
That was the first time I felt or maybe ever needed a father figure .
But it made me who I am .
And , at the end of ` The Right Man , ' I say , ` One day , my little girl will reach out her hand , she 'll know I found the right man . ' ''
