Earl Sweatshirt is an American rapper and member of the Los Angeles based hip hop collective Odd Future .
Earl missed Odd Future 's initial success as his mom sent him away to a Samoan boarding school because he kept getting into trouble .
This was Earl 's first solo single following his return from Samoa .
It was released on November 2 , 2012 .
The introspective song was produced by twin brothers , Kehinde `` Rich '' Hassan and Taiwo `` Christian '' Hassan and was birthed freestyle during one of their studio sessions .
`` Most of the sessions were about five hours of talking crap -- what artists you like and you do n't like , having fun -- and then he 'll just black out and be like , ` OK I got a verse , ' '' Kehinde explained to MTV News `` That 's how ` Chum ' worked . ''
`` We were just playing around , '' he added , `` and I did n't even think the beat was done yet , and he 's like , ` Yo I got a whole song . '
He goes in the booth and just spits it in one take .
One take .
What happened to that dude was chillin ' and talking crap ?
He said ` I 'm gon na do this in one take , ' and he really did . ''
The time Earl Sweatshirt spent at the Coral Reef Academy became public knowledge when Complex magazine published an article revealing his location , to the dismay of his family .
The rapper addressed the media fiasco on this song : `` I know you 're happy now Craven and these Complex f -- n -- as done track me down Just to be the guys that did it , like I like attention Supposed to be grateful , right Like thanks so much , you made my life Harder and the ties between my mama are strained and tightened . ''
Earl told MTV News : `` Most of the s -- t that I get , and that I 've gotten in my entire career , has been based on s -- t that 's going on in my life and not music stuff . ''
