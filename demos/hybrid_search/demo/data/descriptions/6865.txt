Guitarist Ben Savage explained in our interview that Bozeman also gives musical input , however , making various tweaks and suggestions once a song approaches its final musical form .
This song appeared on Whitechapel 's 2008 sophomore release , This is Exile .
The concept album told the story of an epic struggle for humankind to survive against an oppressive evil .
While it has religious undertones , Bozeman said that he 's not religious himself and that he believes the album takes on themes of good versus evil in a more universal way .
Bozeman explained to Kill the Music that `` Exalt '' is about the perils of blind devotion to a cult .
`` It portrays the madness and and corruption they cause in people , '' he said .
`` Believe in yourself and what 's true in your heart , not what someone brainwashes you and tells you to believe . ''
The track features guest vocals from Guy Kozowyk of the Deathgrind act The Red Chord .
