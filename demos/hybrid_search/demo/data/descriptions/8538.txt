DJ Khaled 's second single from his fifth studio album , We The Best Forever features an A-list trio of rappers - Drake , Rick Ross and Lil Wayne .
It was released for digital download in the United States on May 20 , 2011 .
Drake 's contribution features him spitting - `` Hate the rumors hate the bulls -- t hate these f -- in allegations/I 'm just feelin like the throne is for the taking .
Watch me take it . ''
His verse provoked comment that he was dissing Jay-Z as many listeners interpreted it as referencing Jay-Z 's album with Kanye West , Watch The Throne .
However Rick Ross denied any ideas that the lyrics were thinly veiled shots at Hov .
`` I know when those records are released and those vibes are in the air , I know the certain excitement that people anticipate and want to make it into , '' Ross explained to MTV News .
`` But I know Drake , and I know when he 's writing , he 's most definitely being the most creative , but I know he would n't disrespect Jay . ''
The song topped Billboard 's R&B / Hip-Hop Songs chart for 11 weeks .
When Khaled approached Drake to appear on one of his tracks , the Canadian MC felt he wanted to contribute something memorable .
`` Khaled waited , like , forever and a day .
I was taking my sweet time trying to craft this piece of music because I knew he needed a special moment , '' Drizzy told MTV News .
`` When I did it , I was like , ` OK , it 's got ta be me , Ross and Wayne . '
That 's the first time anybody has ever heard all three of us on a record . ''
The song was DJ Khaled 's first Hot 100 hit top 10 hit .
His previous best chart ranking was the # 19 peaking , `` I 'm So Hood '' in 2007 .
