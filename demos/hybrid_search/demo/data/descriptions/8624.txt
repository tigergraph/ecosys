This sweet Pop Soul ballad finds Weller offering a sentimental message to his children as delivered from beyond the grave .
Weller told NME : `` It 's the first time my kids have sung on one of my records .
When I was writing it , I was thinking about my dad , who passed away about three years ago , and I was thinking about my role a parent .
The track is about the whole cycle of life . ''
The song features Weller 's daughter Leah , whose mother is former Style Council singer Dee C Lee , on the bridge parts .
She told Q magazine : `` She sounds like her mum in quite an uncanny way . ''
Weller 's five-year-old son Mac also adds a backing vocal to the last chorus .
`` He did it with the headphones on and everything , '' Weller smiled to NME .
`` Then kept saying he were n't happy with the way his voice sounded and wanted to do it again .
A little diva ! ''
