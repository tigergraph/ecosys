This late-night , bar room waltz finds Matt Berninger pining , `` Am I the one you think about when you 're sitting in your fainting chair drinking pink rabbits ? ''
He then proceeds to liken himself to `` a television version of a person with a broken heart . ''
For Berninger , harbouring a new-found love of Roy Orbison melodies , this proved to be a crucial song during the Trouble Will Find Me recordings .
`` I think Aaron -LRB- Dessner , guitar -RRB- actually regretted sending me that song , '' he told The Guardian , `` because when he sent me that one I 'd been working on a bunch of other tracks that he 'd been excited about .
And suddenly I just stopped in my tracks , dropped everything else and I spent three weeks only working on it because I just could n't help it - it was a total , total obsession of mine , because I loved it . ''
