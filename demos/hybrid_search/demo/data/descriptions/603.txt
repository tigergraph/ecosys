Arctic Monkeys ' vocalist Alex Turner wrote and performed five songs for the soundtrack of Submarine , the 2011 feature film of Richard Ayoade , who has directed some of the band 's music videos .
This tune is one of the quintet that he penned for the movie .
Turner told NME : `` This one is on the Submarine soundtrack although I did n't write it specifically for that .
I had a couple of things lying around that were too quiet to be Monkeys tunes -- well , that 's what I thought , anyway .
So I said , what about these and Richard liked them .
But then we were putting this together and I really thought it might fit in with ` Thunderstorms ' and ` Suck It and See . '
So we thought why not just do another version -LRB- recorded with the full band -RRB- because the one on Submarine is just me and James -LRB- Ford , producer -RRB- , he played drums and there 's some strings and stuff on it .
I think doing that Submarine album did lead me into some of the songs on this album too . ''
