Korn lead singer Jonathan Davis said : `` The song is about domestic abuse and that there are ways to get help .
Whether it 's telling someone or calling a help line , there are ways to get out of those situations .
No one has to be treated like that . ''
Limp Bizkit 's Fred Durst directed the video , whose concept was a teen coping with domestic abuse .
According to Pop-Up video , MTV had a problem with the beating part .
They would n't allow Korn to show any direct contact.According to Korn 's management the electricity part of the video , `` represents the power inside us to change our situation and take control . ''
Korn saw it differently , `` it was just a metal cool thing . ''
At the end of the clip when the room starts lighting up , if you look close enough you can see Fred Durst 's face for a split second .
-LRB- thanks , Flavio - Miami , FL -RRB- This was the first hit off of their fourth CD , Issues .
The CD came with four different covers .
The most common one had a voodoo doll on the cover .
A second cover was a chalk design on a playground of a girl and a boy , a third had the band as dummies with fake hair and zipped-up mouths , and the fourth showed a bunch of newspaper headlines glued to a wall and in the middle was a picture of someone laying down in a dark room with a shadow behind him .
