Clyne likes to include paradox and juxtaposition in his songwriting , which explains the title `` Beautiful Disaster . ''
Here 's what he says about this song : `` It 's just a fun rock song .
I 'd never used the highway metaphor before , and when I started to use that , I started finding myself running into the same literary devices that Bruce Springsteen uses all the time , he could n't get around them .
So I decided to put that middle section , ` Take the wheel , the highway 's clear , ' and basically lift that out of Born To Run for however many bars that is , like 6 or 8 bars , and just to acknowledge that it 's a tribute , and not a pilfering , I put the glockenspiel behind it , because it comes right out of Born To Run .
But it 's about being very , very enthusiastic about your power and freedom . ''
