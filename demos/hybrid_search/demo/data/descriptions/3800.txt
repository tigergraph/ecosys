This brutal track finds Brent Smith singing of a person who knew how to get under his skin .
Unusually for a Shinedown recording there are some cuss words .
Drummer Barry Kerch told Alternative Addiction : It 's about someone in Brent 's life who really wore him down .
We do n't like cussing on records , although we all cuss like sailors it makes Brent 's grandma angry .
The profanity works well with the song and I can really relate to that . ''
