This song finds Karen O singing about wrestling with an emotional bondage .
It is one of several Mosquito tracks that incorporates dub elements .
Karen O told NME why the band went in a reggae direction for the album : `` The demos were sounding like that because of the way we were recording , '' she explained .
`` We started demoing once we got off the road in 2010 , in our little studio in New York .
One mic in a little space with lots of delays on my vocals and lots of delay on Nick -LRB- Zinner , guitar -RRB- 's amps ... there was a vibe and a quality of the sound that was going in that direction so we explored it . ''
