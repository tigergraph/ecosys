Vocalist Matt Davies-Kreye told Kerrang !
magazine September 13 , 2008 : `` I think during the writing of -LRB- 2007 album -RRB- Tales Do n't Tell Themselves , we 'd all become really tired and bored of heavy , aggressive music and could n't really get inspired to write in that sort of style anymore .
I think we just forgot what it was that made us fall in love with heavy music in the first place .
This song reminded us what we loved about all our favorite hard rock bands growing up and how exciting the riff could be .
Not only that , but how powerful aggressive vocals can be when used in the right context and not just as a gimmick . ''
