This is the first single from Texas-based Rock band Flyleaf 's second album , Memento Mori .
Flyleaf debuted this song in early 2007 when touring in support of their self-titled debut album .
However the lyrics to the song changed after they decided to record it .
Mosley explained : `` The fans seem to know what 's happening with us before we do and I 'm not surprised to find out many have known the lyrics to ` Again ' for a year now .
:--RRB- The first verse and chorus did change in the studio !
It is a good thing , because the words say better what my heart meant . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Meiert Avis -LRB- Avril Lavigne , U2 , Bruce Springsteen -RRB- .
Guitarist Sameer Bhattacharya told MTV News that the video 's concept ties in with the album title .
He explained : `` The whole theme is that everything comes to an end .
But there 's always hope and a bigger picture too .
`` The woodcuts in the video that are formed from light and energy were created by bassist Pat Seals , who also designed all the artwork for the album .
Lead singer Lacey Moseley explained the song in a letter written to fans : `` It is written for people like me , who feel a restlessness to make the world better somehow , but are much to small to carry the weight of the world on their shoulders .
Its to say , you have the right heart , but you were n't meant to carry it all .
You are so strong , you are able to handle so much !
But you ca n't handle everything all at once .
Let go !
God 's big and He can handle it all better than you !
Its okay to let go and not understand everything . ''
Memento Mori takes its title from the Latin phrase , which translates as `` Remember you shall die . ''
The band said they hoped it would encourage people to make the most of every moment .
