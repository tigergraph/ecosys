Wilson Phillips released yet another love song , in this case telling a would-be secret admirer that she 's on to him and that the interest is mutual , so he should `` give it up '' and be honest with her about her interest .
This was Wilson Phillips ' last song to reach the charts .
The following year , the group itself decided to give it up and went their separate ways .
The split was amicable and they remained friends , they reunited in 2004 and have recorded and performed from time to time since .
