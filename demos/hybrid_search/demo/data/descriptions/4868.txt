This is the second single released by English Pop singer Conor Maynard .
Conor told Capital Radio that with this tune , he wanted to prove you could be anywhere in the world and party like you 're in Las Vegas .
The song was released July 22 , 2012 .
The song finds Conor singing about partying with Rihanna and Beyonc√© .
`` It 's really tongue in cheek , '' he told The Daily Telegraph , `` even just the fact that I 'm from Brighton and I 've never been to Vegas .
I 've never met any of those women - to me it means it does n't matter where you are , or who you 're with , if you 're having fun you can be anywhere in the world . ''
The original plan for the filming of the song 's music video had to be aborted because of Conor 's young age - he was just 19 .
He explained to MTV Australia : `` We were kind of thinking to ourselves when we wrote it and finished it and it was going to be a single , ` Oh wow we 're gon na shoot a video in Vegas , it 's gon na be crazy ! '
And then we kind of realized ` Oh , wait , I 'm actually too young to even go out in Vegas so it 'd be pretty pointless !
` We did n't want it to be like me dancing with the bouncers outside the club like , ` Yay ! '
So we decided OK let 's do it from a different perspective .
And then the idea came to do it in New York with a girl wearing a ` Vegas Girl ' T-shirt and I think it all fitted together and ended up turning into quite a cool story . ''
Maynard told MTV News that his intention for Contrast was to create `` a very unique , original sound . ''
He added that he and the production trio The Invisible Men were `` experimenting in the studio '' when he recorded this song . ''
`` And it just felt really good , '' he continued .
`` It felt right , and it did n't really sound like anything that was out at the time .
It was just a fun track that I enjoyed recording and I 'm hoping people enjoy listening to .
I suppose it 's just a fun tongue-in-cheek song , and I suppose that 's kind of my personality . ''
