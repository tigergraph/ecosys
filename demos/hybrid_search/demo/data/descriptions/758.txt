This was on Devendra 's Banhart first set for XL Recordings after he 'd recorded 3 albums and an EP for Michael Gira 's Young God label .
In an interview with Mojo Magazine January 2008 , Banhart was asked how much Michael Gira helped in getting him up and running .
He replied : `` With the song ' I Love That Man , ' people thought it was about what I think of groupies , or people in audiences think of me .
It was actually a song about Michael Gira .
I would definitely 100 % not be sitting here now -LRB- if not for him -RRB- .
I 'll never forget the day I was sitting in this piece of s -- t place , no electricity or heat in the winter , reading Mojo , shivering and reading a quote with my name on it - what a feeling .
It was amazing .
It was the best feeling . ''
