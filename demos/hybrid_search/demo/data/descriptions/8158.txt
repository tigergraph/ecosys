The words for this American carol are based on a poem written by a young Unitarian minister in Massachusetts , Reverend Edmund Hamilton Sears -LRB- 1810-1876 -RRB- , reportedly at the request of his friend and fellow minister , W.P. Lunt .
It was first presented at his 1849 Sunday School Christmas celebration and was originally published on December 29 , 1849 in a church magazine , The Christian Register .
The poem was not the first Christmas poetry by Sears ; he had written other Nativity lyrics and several books on religious topics .
In addition , he was the editor for the Boston-based Monthly Religious Magazine from 1859 to 1871 .
The following year , inspired by the poem , a friend of Sears , Richard Storrs Willis -LRB- 1819-1900 -RRB- , adapted the words to a melody called `` Carol , '' which he had written for the organ .
Willis , who was an eminent editor and critic for The New York Tribune , had studied music in Europe as a young man with , among others , Felix Mendelssohn , the composer of the music for `` Hark !
The Herald Angels Sing . ''
Mendelssohn so much admired Willis 's work that he rearranged some of it for orchestra .
In 2006 Daryl Hall and John Oates reached # 1 on the American Adult Contemporary chart with their version of this carol .
It could be claimed that this was the first Christmas song to be composed in the United States , and today it is considered a standard .
In the mid 1850s the Americans were only beginning to celebrate the Christmas traditions of their English forebearers .
The influence of works such as A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens were beginning to enthuse the American nation .
Within 20 years other classic carols celebrating Christmas such as `` We Three Kings of Orient Are , '' `` Jingle Bells , '' `` I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day '' and `` O Little Town Of Bethlehem '' had been written in the United States .
