This song finds Kimberley Perry singing about that initial spark that happens when you meet the `` One . ''
The Band Perry co-wrote nine of Pioneer 's twelve tracks .
The siblings write well together because they each bring their own strengths to the table .
`` Reid is our bass player so he really handles a lot of the chord structures , '' said Kimberley .
`` Neil 's our avid reader , so he likes to contribute to lyrics .
And I bring a lot of melody to the table .
I think it 's a really wonderful thing that we 're built with such different strengths and that we kind of complement each other . ''
