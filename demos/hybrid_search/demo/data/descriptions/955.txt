This song was inspired by the theological concept that when someone becomes a Christian , they are filled with the Holy Spirit who comes to live within the believer .
Their body then becomes a temple , belonging to God not to be violated , though the believer still struggles with his own human internal desires and fears .
Frontman Jesse Leach explained to Artist Direct in a 2012 interview : `` To me , it 's kind of a gospel song in a way .
You 're looking up to God and saying , ` Give me peace .
Help me to see life through different eyes .
Teach me your ways and allow me to safe . '
It 's a cry to faith . ''
Leach was struggling with depression at the time , which later forced him to quit Killswitch in the middle of their first national tour .
The singer articulated his struggles on this song as he explained to Artist Direct : `` There 's pain behind it to because at the time I was struggling with depression , which is something that 's come and gone in my life a lot .
You 're crying out to God like , ` Help me out here .
I 'm having a hard time . '
That 's what it 's about .
At the root of it , that 's where it 's coming from . ''
