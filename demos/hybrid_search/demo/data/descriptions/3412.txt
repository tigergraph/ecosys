This song , which is about a self-investigation following a failed relationship , was written by Toby Keith and his frequent collaborator Bobby Pinson .
Keith Pinson told AOL 's The Boot about the song 's lyrical content : `` The song means I could have done everything that was going to be right for you , but it was going to be wrong for me .
Then , because of that , I would n't be somebody you wanted to love .
Me trying to be who you thought you wanted me to be was going to wind up me being somebody I did n't want to be .
That 's just not meant to be .
I would have lost you because of it . ''
Keith explained on the press release for That Do n't Make Me a Bad Guy : `` This has one of those infectious melodies where it sounds like something you 've heard before .
I did n't do all the things you wanted me to do , but even if I 'd done just enough to make you stay , I 'd have lost you anyway . ''
