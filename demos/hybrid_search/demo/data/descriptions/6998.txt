This power ballad is the first single by Irish pop rock band The Script , from their sophomore album , titled Science & Faith .
Danny O'Donoghue of The Script told the story behind the song in an interview with Merrick , Dools & Ricki-Lee on Sydney radio station Nova 96.9 .
Said O'Donoghue : `` The song ` For the First Time ' was about a time when we got back after touring around the world .
We wanted to press palms with the people who had really gotten us there , and we got home and realised there 's a stark reality out there , the recession has hit , people are losing their jobs and their valuable things , and we thought , this almost pales in comparison to our news.We started the song , and it ended up being a bit bleak and we felt we really needed a great message in these , to turn it around ... so we needed a message of hope , as being are being stripped of all these things they 're realising what 's really important .
It 's all about going back to basics , drinking cheap wine , eating your dinner off the floor .
That 's when you meet each other for the first time , when you have nothing . ''
The music video features band members of The Script within a studio and clips of a couple that have emigrated from Ireland to New York .
Eve Hewson , daughter of U2 's Bono , plays one of the characters in the clip .
The song debuted at # 1 on the Irish Singles Chart , becoming The Script 's first chart-topper in their home country .
