On this song , frontman Tim Smith sings about wanting to be alone and free .
He told The Sun January 29 , 2010 : It 's not about rulers of nations but about the rulers in your everyday life .
I 've worked enough jobs where the company , year by year , becomes more corrupt , greedy and takes advantage of you . ''
A number of critics have commented that the lyrics on The Courage of Others are Smith 's most personal to date .
He told Mojo magazine February 2010 : `` I did n't have a character in mind , like I usually did in the past , or any real visuals in my head .
I just started writing one song after the other and then you get to the end of it and you realise Oh yeah , it does seem like I 'm writing more from the first-person point of view .
Which is nice . ''
