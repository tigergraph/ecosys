This is the title track of The Band Perry 's second studio album .
To begin the recording process , the trio took a road trip from Tennessee out to Malibu , California .
They wrote a lot of the music along the way , including this song in Santa Fe , New.Mexico .
The album title was inspired by The Band Perry 's own road trip .
`` We see it as a journey , '' Kimberly Perry told Billboard magazine .
`` It 's us going from point A to point B and every step along the way .
That journey led us to a new horizon and a new place . ''
The band explained during an album preview event that the song title pays tribute to those who set foot `` into the unknown . ''
The tune 's message is about the exhilaration of exploring the unknown .
`` The song really asks more questions than it has answers , '' Kimberly explained to The Boot .
`` Sometimes when you 're barreling towards your future , you have no idea what it 's gon na look like or how you 're gon na get there , and it can be a scary thing .
`` For us , ` Pioneer ' is about the journey from our first album to our second , '' she added , `` everything that we 've been thinking about and living out for the past two years .
It 's about putting one foot in front of the other and about the journey .
We did take a literal journey from east Tennessee all the way to the southwest and Malibu to do a long songwriting trip .
` Pioneer ' was written on a hilltop in Santa Fe with the skyline in the background , and it was just a beautiful , inspiring moment . ''
