Vocalist Josh Todd said of this song : `` Liberty is freedom ... freedom and orgasm is what it 's about .
For me , I like a good release .
At the end of the day , you want to just get it out . ''
Guitarist Keith Nelson : `` That started as a slide guitar riff song .
Musically , that 's a side of Buckcherry that could have been on our first record - along with ` All Night Long ' Sometimes as a band , it 's important for us to remember where we come from . ''
