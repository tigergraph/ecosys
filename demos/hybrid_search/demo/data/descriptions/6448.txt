This is the title track and first single from singer and American Idol season 8 runner-up , Adam Lambert 's debut album .
This was co-written by Claude Kelly and Dr Luke , who also produced the track .
Their previous collaborations include `` Circus '' for Britney Spears , `` My Life Would Suck Without You '' for Kelly Clarkson and `` Party in the U.S.A. '' for Miley Cyrus .
The song 's music video was directed by Ray Kay , who did the clip for Lady Gaga 's `` Poker Face . ''
Lambert told Digital Spy about the song : `` It 's real sexy , very contemporary dance-pop .
It has a dark , mysterious electro sound to it and lyrically there 's definitely a double meaning .
It 's me saying , ` Here I am , I 'm going to put on a show ' .
It also shows my musical theatre influences - it 's almost like that song ` Wilkommen ' from Cabaret - and I think in many ways it sums up my thing .
That 's why I wanted it as the first single , because it 's a great introduction . ''
Lambert announced the choice of this song as the album 's lead single via Twitter .
He tweeted : `` Debut single is called ` For Your Entertainment ' get ready to shake yo asses to this song .
It 'll make ya dance for sure . ''
Lambert explained to Billboard magazine that this was chosen as the lead single as , `` I wanted to release something that would be played in a club , that would make you dance on New Year 's . ''
The glowing , spacey album cover in which Lambert sports dramatic eyeliner and cobalt-blue hair drew mixed reactions from fans .
Lambert defended the image on his twitter .
He tweeted : `` Thank you to those who appreciate and understand that the album cover is deliberately campy .
It 's an omage -LSB- sic -RSB- to the past .
It IS ridiculous .
For those that do n't get it : oh well ... Glad to have gotten your attention .
androgyny .
Rock n Roll . ''
