Airborne leader Mikel Jollett grew up as a poor child of itinerant hippie parents and his upbringing has had an effect on his songwriting .
This song is about his father .
Jollet told Spinner about his folks : `` My dad did three years in Chino before I was born and when he got out , he got clean .
He was on heroin and stole credit cards , all this s -- , but he cleaned up .
A lot of people do n't and since I was born , he 's been clean.He has this way of thinking about life where it 's just like ` If something 's not good then just move the f -- down the road .
Pack up and move to the next spot . '
He 's always sort of seen it that way .
A lot of parents put a lot of head-trips on their kids that they 've got to be a certain person to make their dads proud , like somebody spends all this time going to law school but they do n't want to be a lawyer .
I never felt that way for a minute .
My parents were glad I did graduate from high school , but there was always a sense of ` Here 's the world , do what you 're gon na do .
Try to do something important , stick around family , do n't be an a ----- e , maintain some humility and if your situation gets f -- ed up , move down the road . ' ''
