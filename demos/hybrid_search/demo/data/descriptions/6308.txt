Conor Oberst told the Independent newspaper July 18,2008 about the inspiration behind this song , which honors the life of a cancer patient .
He explained : `` I was walking to this liquor store and pharmacy in Nebraska with a friend of mine .
Suddenly , she was like , ` Oh my God !
Look at that old man sitting in that car , look at how small he is ! '
Of course , when we got closer we realized it was actually a little boy .
It turned out he was waiting in line with his mom to get medicine , and we were there to buy vodka or something .
My friend started crying , and we just went home .
It was just one of those life experiences that begs to be written about .
It 's partly about Danny , but it 's also about whether or not you can transmit your experience of love to another person and whether that message remains intact when it arrives . ''
