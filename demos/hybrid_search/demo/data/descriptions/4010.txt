Crooked Vultures are a Rock group featuring the frontman of Queens of the Stone Age , Josh Homme , ex Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl , and former Led Zeppelin bassist , John Paul Jones .
This manic blues number is their first single from their self-titled debut album .
This was the first track the band worked on .
Jones explained to the BBC : `` Dave said , ` I 've got these chords , ' so we thought , ` Let 's have a bash at that . '
We worked it into the song you hear now . ''
Homme and Jones had never met until just before the band were formed .
Homme explained to Antiquiet that it was Grohl who put together the trio .
Said Homme : `` Dave mentioned this idea , and we 're always looking for a chance to do stuff together .
So he said , ` You know what , maybe I should ask John Paul Jones ! '
And I was like , ` That 'd be awesome .
And I 'll ask The President .
And we can put it all together . '
And then all of a sudden he starts sending me e-mails of correspondence between him and Jones ... I had n't played guitar for five months , and I was gon na maybe take a break for a second , for my first time in a long time .
But then -LSB- Dave -RSB- has his birthday party at Medieval Times , and of course he sat us right next to each other .
That was the blind date .
But he sat in the next row behind us , looking over .
But you know , I think it 's fairly common to meet someone from Zeppelin at Medieval Times . ''
