This early Elton John/BernieTaupin composition was released as the B-side of `` Border Song ; '' in Elizabeth Rosenthal 's book His Song : The Musical Journey of Elton John , Elton attributes it to Bernie 's passion for science fiction .
Although `` Bad Side Of The Moon '' did not appear on the Elton John album , it was re-recorded for the 1971 live album 17-11-70 , which was released in the United States as 11-17-70 because of the different date format .
This version runs to 6 minutes 10 seconds , but in 1996 when Elton John was re-issued on CD , a studio version running to 3 minutes 15 seconds was included on it .
