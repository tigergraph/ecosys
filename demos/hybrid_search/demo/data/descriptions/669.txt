Santigold explained the meaning of this deeply personal jam to Spin magazine : `` It 's getting out a bunch of anger inside about the death of my dad , '' she said .
Santigold told Spin that she matched the song 's angry emotion with an `` epic '' sound , layering her vocals , `` into my own choir and getting producer Greg Kurstin to play percussion on a glass bottle to match a marimba sound .
`` It 's really grand .
It 's my way of painting a musical landscape .
These songs are multi-layered and ambitious sounding , like a Peter Gabriel epic , '' she said .
The singer admitted to NME , `` I 'm the least political person I know . ''
Despite this , there is still a political bent to several tracks on Master Of My Make-Believe , including this one .
`` I connected with all the things that were happening while I was making this album - earthquakes , riots - on a human level , not a political one , '' she clarified .
`` I wanted to express how f -- ed up everything was . ''
The singer elaborated on the song 's glass bottle percussion to Billboard magazine : `` On this one song , we did a whole section that has a bottle used as the percussion , so there 's layers upon layers of Greg Kurstin playing a bottle and literally filling it with different layers of water , and stacking each note .
Mixed with a marimba and taiko drums ! ''
