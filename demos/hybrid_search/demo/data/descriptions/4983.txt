The Light Of The Sun was executive produced by American soul and R&B producer JR Hutson , who first worked with Scott on 2007 's The Real Thing .
He told Billboard magazine this playful track illustrated the singer 's desire to destroy boundaries and let whatever happens in the studio happen .
`` She Jay-Z-ed that song , '' he said .
`` Singing as she was writing it .
And when we stopped the tape , that 's what the song was .
She has such a dedication to being honest - that permeates her music . ''
