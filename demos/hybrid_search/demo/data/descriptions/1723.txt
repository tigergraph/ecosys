Rancid explained on their MySpace site : `` This was the only song that we recorded that we felt would fit at the end of the record .
It 's the best way to explain every individual in the band and it sums up the pure pleasure of playing together and the hope that it never ends .
` It 's all I 've ever done , all I 've ever known , just wan na play one more show and make some music with my friends ' . ''
