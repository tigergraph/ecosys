The final four songs on In the Belly of the Brazen Bull are joined together into a 12 minute four-track `` suite , '' recorded by the band themselves at Abbey Road in London .
Vocalist Gary Jarman told NME : `` It might sound proggy but it 's not proggy at all .
It 's something we 've wanted to explore - combining songs we 've had floating about for a while . ''
This is the first of the quartet .
Guitarist Ryan Jarman explained to NME : `` It sounds quite freeform .
The first song is kind of ` playground ' , although I know that sounds ridiculous .
There 's lots of discordance . ''
