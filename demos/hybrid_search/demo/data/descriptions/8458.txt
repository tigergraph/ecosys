This was one of two songs on Archuleta 's self-titled debut album that he helped write , the other one being `` Do n't Let Go . ''
The Utah singer told MTV News that of his two self-penned efforts , this one , `` was a little more difficult to record , just because it was a little more rhythm and things going on with the song . ''
