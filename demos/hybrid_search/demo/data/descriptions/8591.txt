This song is about a man being baptized , and how it 's like he 's being reborn anew with no sins , when he was dying before .
Lead singer John Cooper told GoUpstate.com that his love of '80s rock 'n' roll acts such as Metallica , Bon Jovi , and Motley Crue greatly influences Skillet 's heavy sound .
`` Eighties music was so dynamic and theatrical .
I love it , '' he said , `` I think our song ` Rebirthing ' kind of embodies everything that I like about Skillet .
It 's heavy , but it 's very melodic and I like how theatrical the vocals are .
The string section is very classical sounding and it has a great guitar solo with a very '80s metal sound .
It has everything that is good about Skillet in that song .
`` Cooper added this is his favorite Skillet song .
