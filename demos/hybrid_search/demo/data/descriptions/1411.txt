According to guitarist Chad Thomas , the band penned this song in 15 minutes .
The video was shot in London during the summer of 2011 .
Thomas told Spinner they , `` liked the vibrancy and simplicity of people being able to observe us in a circle , which is how we set up to rehearse .
No tricks , that 's how we do it .
Just the five of us and our instruments in a room , that 's where all the songs are born . ''
