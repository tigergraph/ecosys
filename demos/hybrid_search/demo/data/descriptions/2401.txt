Pusha T of Clipse told MTV News how the song came together : `` The whole idea for the whole record came about because at the time the Clipse were real heavy on the blogs .
Cam 's comeback was real heavy .
We were both about to drop albums .
We 're like , ` Yo , we need to make one of them New York records - real lyrical , like , a fan record . '
We both have two really strong cult followings .
From that conversation , Pharrell went into the studio and start playing with the drums and -LSB- came up with -RSB- ` Popular Demand . '
Once the title came up , it was over .
Pharrell got in full Cam mode . ''
Pusha added that the brothers were determined to get a Cameron verse on the record : `` We started reaching out to Duke -LSB- DaGod , Cam 's A&R -RSB- , just making sure it happened , '' Pusha recalled .
`` He came through and he did it .
I think everybody is gon na take to this record .
Everybody ! ''
