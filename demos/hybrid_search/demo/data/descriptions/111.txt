The guy Brittany Howard is lusting after on this song , is the same one she later bags in `` I Found You '' but who turns out to be a cheater in `` Heartbreaker . ''
`` If you want something then go for it , and if it does n't work then write a song about it , '' the singer told NME .
Alabama Shakes made their first UK television debut on April 24 , 2012 , when they appeared on Later ... with Jools Holland and performed this song along with `` Hold On '' and `` Hang Loose . ''
Howard told NME : `` That was one of those songs that just came out of nowhere , about the same guy .
The music would spur the emotion and that 's what you sing about , because that 's what you know . ''
