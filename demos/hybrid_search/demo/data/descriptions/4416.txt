This was released as the fourth single from the British electronic Garage-House act Disclosure 's debut studio album , Settle .
It was the duo 's first single from the set not to feature a guest vocalist .
A reworked version of the song , featuring Mary J. Blige , was released on January 23 , 2014 .
The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul also joined the Lawrence boys to perform the tune during their show at Terminal 5 in Manhattan .
The collaboration came about when Blige came across the song and fell for it .
She requested the parts and devised her own vocal line to lay over the original track alongside Howard Lawrence 's vocals , and sent it back to the brothers for their thoughts .
The song was Disclosure 's fourth consecutive release to reach the Top 20 of the UK single charts .
However , the duo 's Guy Lawrence insisted to NME that their material is still `` underground music '' despite its mainstream success .
He said : `` We have n't sold out .
If you take all the vocals off our tunes , it 's still underground music .
There 's something weird about how songs are classified as ` commercial ' or ` mainstream ' these days .
For us , we do n't give a f -- k .
You can call it mainstream or you can call it super-future-mooncore-tech-garage .
I just call it dance music . ''
