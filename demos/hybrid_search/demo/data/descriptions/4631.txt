Several of the songs on Forever Endeavour , including this one , were inspired by a health scare Sexsmith had in 2011 when doctors discovered a lump in his throat .
As a result when penning the songs for the album mortality was top of mind .
`` As you get older and more of these things happen , you realize that it 's always coming for us and that one day the news wo n't be good news , '' he told Spinner .
`` It 's funny - I had already snuck in some songs about death . ''
Sexsmith told the story of the song to CBC Music .
`` I wrote this initially as a really slow waltz , and I just thought I have too many slow songs on this record , and I wanted it to be more lighthearted , '' he explained , `` so I turned it into the song you hear now .
It 's mainly about the feeling of déjà vu .
I 'm walking around and everything felt like I 'd been there before , and I kept running into people that had been on my mind , and they would come up and say something really nice to me .
I thought , ` Why is everyone being so nice to me , is this what dying feels like ? '
It was just an odd sensation I had , so I wrote this and turned it into a Beatles-y record . ''
