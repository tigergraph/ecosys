This is about a guy deciding that a fake life with a woman is leading him nowhere and he wants to cut it off .
Despite the fact that he seems popular being with this woman and she wants him , he is drinking , they fight , and all of his friends are fake .
It is a song about not selling out for the high life .
-LRB- thanks , Jay - Cottonwood , CA -RRB- More lyric interpretation : `` The amount of pills I 'm taking , counteracts the booze I 'm drinking , And this vanity I 'm breaking lets me live my life like this '' - He 's doing many things at once .
The `` vanity '' could have a double meaning , literally it 's a piece of furniture but it could also indicate how self-absorbed he is .
`` And you can cry all you want to , I do n't care how much . ''
- He does n't care how much she cries and begs him to stop using drugs , he wo n't stop so she might as well give up .
-LRB- thanks , Rhiannon - Manchester , England , for above 2 -RRB- There are some drug references in this song , such as `` Eating breakfast on a mirror , '' which implies doing cocaine after waking up .
The controlling girlfriend does n't want the singer to do them , and he resists .
