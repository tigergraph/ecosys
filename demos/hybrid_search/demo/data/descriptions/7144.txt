This gothic track features a cameo from 72-year-old drummer Clem Cattini , who played on The Tornadoes `` Telstar '' back in 1962 .
Weller said , '' It 's a definite nod to the Walker Brothers and those epic ballads .
I thought it would fitting to get the man who played on a lot of those records to play on it .
He 's seventy odd , but Clem -LRB- Cattini -RRB- came down and did it in literally two takes .
He 's that good . ''
This soulful , Dusty Springfield-style ballad was influenced by the work of Johnny Franz , a producer and A&R man at Philips , who worked with Dusty and The Walker Brothers in the '60s and later on the '80s soul sounds of Alexander O'Neal and Anita Baker .
Weller explained to Mojo magazine : `` I wanted to recreate that '80s soul sound .
But I 'm a big fan of Johnny Franz .
His orchestral arrangements really connect with the emotions and that 's definitely what we were trying to do on that song . ''
