This Mahalia Jackson number was one of several covers Rowley recorded for her album .
She explained to Mojo magazine April 2008 why she did this cover : `` When I hear those songs I say , That 's It !
That 's exactly how I feel Mahalia cuts to the core .
You can hear she 's sweating , she 's dripping wet .
On-stage I think about her and say to myself , This is what my whole life 's been building up to . ''
