This was the only single to be taken from the soundtrack of the movie Sex and the City 2 .
It peaked at # 16 on the Italian Digital Singles Chart , # 58 on the Japan Hot 100 and # 84 on the Australian Singles Chart .
Dido recalled to Canada.com in 2013 : `` I wrote it before -LRB- my son -RRB- Stanley was born , but it 's still so relevant now .
Before I had a family I would do anything and try anything , and then you have a family and you realize for the time you have something to lose .
So it 's about that moment when you realize it 's proper love and you care about losing it . ''
