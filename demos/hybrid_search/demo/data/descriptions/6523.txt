Guitarist Sameer Bhattacharya : `` Have We Lost is about growing up realizing you 've forgotten your dreams .
The end where it says , ` When we were young we spoke in tongues ' refers to the faith we have when we 're young with all of our friends and the love that 's there and growing up and growing apart and those memories becoming fuzzier and fuzzier . ''
