This is the second single to be released by teenage American singer-songwriter Sky Ferreira .
She penned the song with writer and producer Ryan Tedder , who is famed for his ballads such as Leona Lewis ' `` Bleeding Love '' and Beyonc√© 's `` Halo . ''
The track also was appears on the soundtrack of the Vampire Diaries and featured in a promotional video for the 2010-11 season of the show .
Ferreira told The Sun newspaper about the song 's subject matter : `` There are double meanings to it .
It could be seen as being about wanting fame but it 's also me joking about narcissism .
There are n't that many people willing to sing about themselves in that way .
It 's so untasteful , it 's almost tasteful . ''
This was supposed to be Ferreira 's proper launch single , but the teenage singer brought the whole thing crashing down when she publicly slagged the song off .
Speaking with The Guardian in April 2013 , Ferreira claimed that she was forced into recording the tune : '' -LSB- The label -RSB- were like , ` If you do this then you can do whatever you want later , ' which was n't true '' , she said .
