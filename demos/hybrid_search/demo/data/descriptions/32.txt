The origins of this moody , electronic ballad were a rejected demo that had one little part which the band liked .
`` Some songs we 'll come up with demos , and they wo n't ever turn into anything ... we 'll hear them , and we 'll know they 're not ever going to be a great song on their own , '' Mike Shinoda told MTV News .
`` But there may be a section of it , a little glimmer of cool something in it , and the song ` Until It Breaks ' is built from just those .
There were like four demos that we had made that were n't going anywhere individually , but when you put them all together , they make something really interesting .
It 's supposed to feel really jarring and weird , and for me it was a really fun song to make . ''
Guitarist Brad Delson provides a rare vocal on this song .
