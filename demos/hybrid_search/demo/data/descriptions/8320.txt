This 16-and-a-half minute environmental lament is a track from Psychedelic Pill , the first collaboration between Neil Young and Crazy Horse containing original work since the Greendale album and tour in 2003 and 2004 .
Regarding how the song came together , Crazy Horse guitarist Frank `` Poncho '' Sampedro told Rolling Stone : `` We played it one time and the next thing we know we 're doing overdubs .
Then he played it for us .
The playback just blew our minds .
We had no idea we 'd done something that big .
I imagine it 's about Earth being destroyed by this giant , and we 're screening the planet for survivors and s -- t. I have all these images going through my head .
It 's really crazy . ''
