Lyrically , the song describes Kearney 's first meeting with his wife Annie at the Anthropologie store in Tennessee that she was working at .
After courting Annie for a few months , he stole her heart and they married on June 5 , 2010 .
`` I do n't really call her Mama that much , '' Kearney revealed in our interview .
`` Maybe joking around the house , but not regularly .
I think she thinks the song is cute . ''
Kearney says that he did n't set out to write a song about his wife , but somehow it came out that way .
He told us : `` It 's so funny , in the creation of songs , I 'm not thinking of necessarily what it 'll mean later .
If it 's good and it resonates with you and it 's gripping , then it 's cool with me .
And then later you 're like , Wait a second .
I 'm writing a song about how we met and our marriage .
Well that 's going to be a point of discussion now with every interview I do , and are we okay with that ?
-LRB- laughing -RRB- And oh yeah , I 'm talking about this -- I 'm hard to please , you 're hard to get .
You start realizing that 's going out into the world . ''
A fan of Hip-Hop since childhood , Kearney turned to the genre for inspiration when recording his fourth studio album , Young Love .
`` I approached Young Love like a singer-songwriter would approach a Hip-Hop record , '' he said .
`` We would start with beats or grooves that your body already responds to .
It was a fun and fulfilling experiment . ''
This was the song that ignited that experiment .
Kearney said : `` The album really began with ` Hey Mama . '
After clapping into my laptop and programming this beat , I was dancing around the room actually freestyling words .
This was n't me sitting around with some friends and an acoustic guitar .
It was this visceral writing experience .
I tried to find a way to write stories to these beats . ''
The song was released as the album 's lead single on May 10 , 2011 .
