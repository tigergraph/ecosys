This is the title track from American rock band Heart 's thirteenth studio album .
The album was produced by Ben Mink -LRB- kd lang , Barenaked Ladies -RRB- and was Heart 's first set of new material since 2004 's Jupiter 's Darling .
During an in-the-studio interview with Billboard magazine , guitarist Nancy Wilson explained the recording process of the record was organic .
`` We 're recording with just a real woodshed , small acoustic element , people playing together at the same time and -LRB- in -RRB- the same room - like what they used to call a hootenanny , '' she said `` There 's no ProTools feel to it at all .
We 're just sitting around playing guitars together and going for a performance that is on the spot . ''
Nancy Wilson told the story of this song on the band 's website : `` When I first said those words , I knew it right away that it was a phrase worth using in a song .
Sue Ennis - our friend and our co-writer from way back - was in town and really needed a rescue from the Hollywood hotel where she was attending a seminar .
I said , `` Are you kidding me ?
I 'd come get you in a red velvet car .
I wrote it down immediately .
Ann took that title and ran it .
`` Lead singer Ann Wilson added : `` Nancy is like Ringo in that sense .
She 's always been great at coming up with cool turns of phrase that do n't really need to be explained because they communicate something powerfully .
Musically , I 've got to give it to Ben Mink , because I wanted the song to have that R&B sensuality to it , but also something fresh , and I think together , we got it . ''
