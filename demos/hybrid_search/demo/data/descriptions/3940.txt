In an interview with KROQ/Los Angeles , Clare talked about recording live trumpets in New Orleans for this bayou-flavored track .
`` I really , really loved New Orleans , actually .
We started the album there and it just blew my mind .
Just the whole vibe of the place .
It was awesome , '' said Clare `` The trumpets in the background are recorded from a little dictophone in the streets .
It was an amazing place and it definitely rubbed off . ''
Two other The Lateness Of The Hour tracks - `` Relax My Beloved '' and `` Up All Night '' - were also recorded in New Orleans .
