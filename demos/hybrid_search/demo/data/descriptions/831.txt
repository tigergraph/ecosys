DJ Fresh -LRB- real name Daniel Stein -RRB- is a British-based drum & bass producer .
He teamed up with Kosheen vocalist Sian Evans for this song , which was released on July 3 , 2011 as a digital download .
The song was used as part of a Lucozade Lite advertising campaign in the UK and Ireland .
Stein explained to Ministry of Sound : '' ` Louder ' came to be used in the Lucozade Sport Lite advert after the Lucozade team saw the video for ` Gold Dust ' and heard my last single ` Lassitude ' ; they then approached me and Ben Newman , the video director of ` Gold Dust ' to work together on the ` Louder ' video and Lucozade ad .
I think that even I have managed to catch the advert on TV - I hardly ever get time to watch TV so that 's actually pretty amazing !! '' Stein told the story of the song in an interview with Ministry of Sound : `` I started ` Louder ' at the end of last year , it began as an instrumental though it was always supposed to be a song with a vocal .
I played it out at a festival in Belgium and the crowd went nuts !
Sian Evans -LRB- who I knew from her days as frontwoman of Kosheen -RRB- and I had been talking about working on something together for a while and it seemed like the perfect track .
I had a muffled recording of the chorus -LRB- with slightly different words -RRB- , and I 'd excitedly got out of bed to sing into my phone at about 3 o'clock in the morning one night .
When Sian started scatting around it it worked perfectly , we changed a few words , notes etc and then wrote the verses , the whole song was written like that in just one night ! ''
According to the UK 's Official Charts website , the song was the UK 's first dubstep # 1 single .
