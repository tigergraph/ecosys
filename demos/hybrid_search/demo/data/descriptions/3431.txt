Mother Love Bone was comprised of future Pearl Jam members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament , along with Bruce Fairweather , Greg Gilmore , and their frontman , Andrew Wood .
The Mother Love Bone album was n't released until 1992 , two years after Wood died from a heroin overdose and the year after Pearl Jam released their debut album .
A band composition with lyrics by Wood , the song finds him expressing his intractable love as he shuts out the outside world .
Stone Gossard of Mother Love Bone later formed a band called Brad with lead singer Shawn Smith , who learned a lot by watching Andrew Wood at work .
In our interview with Smith , he talked about how this song came together : `` I had a 4-track and a little reverb unit .
Andy lived across the street from me , and sometimes he would call me over to bring over my 4-track , because he had a song or something .
So I recorded him doing the first version of ` Gentle Groove . '
That was cool .
And then I got to see a soundcheck a little while later , the full version with the band , with Love Bone .
And it was just mind blowing .
To see something go from a little acoustic song on my 4-track and then transferred into a band with two Marshall stacks , it was just a huge songwriting moment , where it 's like , ` Oh , that 's what happens . '
You can have the little , teeny thing , and then you can put it in a band and make magic just explode . ''
