Guitarist Synyster Gates told MusicRadar.com that for this song , `` We wanted a really impactful , riff-based intro but one that would also feature our dual lead harmony approach .
It 's pretty cool how it fits into the slow groove of the track and just hammers through . ''
Gates added that all his solos were improvised initially -- the guitarist would go in , get his bearings and see what he came up with .
For this song he , `` was hearing something chaotic in the intro , a machine-gun spray that would build into something more melodic . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Andrew Baird -LRB- Cage The Elephant , Carrie Underwood -RRB- .
The clip is described in the press release as `` a grisly street fight on the dark streets of an urban metropolis .
Haunted by dark creatures and lost souls . ''
The song is n't about military warfare , rather it concerns the internal battles within our minds .
Vocalist M. Shadows explained to Kerrang !
magazine : `` Lyrically , it 's not about going to Iraq and shooting people .
It 's more about the war inside your head , and living with the decisions that you make that everyone 's battling in their own way . ''
