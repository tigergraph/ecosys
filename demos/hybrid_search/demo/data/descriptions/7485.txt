This rootsy paean is the title track of the fifth studio album by American musician John Mayer .
Produced by the singer with Don Was -LRB- Rolling Stones , Bonnie Raitt -RRB- the record marked a change in Mayer 's musical style , incorporating musical elements of Folk and Americana .
The song finds Mayer attempting to come to terms with his true self , as he despairs that , `` it gets hard to fake what I wo n't be . ''
The song is reprised at the end of the album in a rootsier version with more harmonica .
That 's Mayer himself on the opening harmonica .
The track also features multi-instrumentalist Greg Leisz on lap steel guitarist , whilst David Crosby and Graham Nash contribute supporting vocals .
Mayer 's parents concluded an uncontested divorce on May 27 , 2009 , and he addresses that heartbreak when he sings : `` I still got faith .
I call on both of my brothers .
I got a mom , I got a dad .
But they do not have each other . ''
The Born and Raised album debuted at # 1 in six countries : Australia , New Zealand , Canada , Denmark , Netherlands and the United States .
It also hit the top position on iTunes in 30 territories worldwide .
