Running to a mere 2 minutes and 4 seconds , this downtempo track from the Birds album is folk stripped right down , just Bic and a simple guitar melody .
In a June 2006 interview with Sally Fairfax of Radio Leeds she said it came about after she decided to write a song in the style of Alan Lomax.Although he was himself a musician , Bic was clearly not referring to his guitar style but to his song collecting - for want of a better phrase .
Alan Lomax -LRB- 1915-2002 -RRB- was the son of John A. Lomax , and followed in his father 's footsteps .
Between 1937 and 1942 he worked for the Archive Of Folk Song , part of the Library Of Congress , to which the father and son team contributed more than ten thousand folk recordings from around the world .
In the 1950s he relocated to London where among other things he worked with the BBC.His monographs include The Folk Songs Of North America and a biography of the jazz musician Jelly Roll Morton.In March 2004 , the American Folklife Center - part of the Library Of Congress - added The Alan Lomax Collection to its archives bringing his entire life 's work together under one roof .
