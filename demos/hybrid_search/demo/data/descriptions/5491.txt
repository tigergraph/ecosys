This was originally earmarked to be the second single from London indie pop band The Hoosiers ' sophomore album , The Illusion of Safety with a release date of October 17 , 2010 .
However on 14 , October 2010 , front man Irwin Sparkes announced on The Hoosiers ' Official Twitter Page that there was a change of plan and it would no longer be released as a single .
Regular Hoosier collaborators Diamond Dogs -LRB- Phil Sansom and Olly Williams -RRB- directed the music video .
It features the band as explorers in a volcanic land where Time forgot - in reality a quarry in Derbyshire .
Guitarist Martin Skarendah described this to 4Music as , `` a very uplifting track and the most exciting track on the album .
It 's really in your face and it has very memorable lyrics .
It 's been a favourite track to play live and it gets a really good response .
It 's that mix of a dancey feel with a band playing . ''
