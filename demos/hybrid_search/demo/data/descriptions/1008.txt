The Beatles were known for having fun with journalists , rarely giving a straight answer at their early press conferences .
The title of this song -LRB- and the album -RRB- comes from something John Lennon used to say in response to the constant question , `` How did the band get its name ? ''
Lennon 's reply : `` I had a vision that a man came unto us on a flaming pie , and he said , ` You are Beatles with an A. ' And so we were .
`` McCartney conceived much of the Flaming Pie album while he was working on the Beatles Anthology project ; he explained : `` Watching the Anthology also reminded me of the time that we did n't take to make an album and of the fun we had when we did one .
The Beatles were not a serious group ... So I wanted to try to get back into some of that ; to have some fun and not sweat it . ''
Jeff Lynne sang on this track , played electric guitar , and produced it with McCartney .
Paul decided he wanted to simulate a typical early Beatles session for this track , which meant recording three songs in about four hours .
McCartney sang it live while he played the piano and Lynne played guitar ; drums and bass , then guitars and backing vocals were then added .
