Wainwright wrote this song while his mother , Kate McGarrigle , was dying of cancer at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal .
He addresses his mother 's illness directly but this is no clich√©d eulogy .
Instead , it 's a collection of assorted memories .
All of the songs on All Days Are Nights : Songs For Lulu are performed by Wainwright accompanying himself on piano rather than the lush orchestrations and arrangements that have marked most of his other work .
He explained to Billboard magazine : `` This album is a product of my reaction to the various momentous occasions I was experiencing , whether it was my mother 's health or the opera -LRB- Prima Donna -RRB- or the Judy -LRB- Garland -RRB- show or my touring .
I was really drawn to the piano , the main reason being that it was where I could be alone and I could sort of tell everybody to skidaddle , and these songs started to come .
It was a way for me to exorcise or sacrifice music to this great hurt and wounded and volatile part of myself ; instead of perhaps going out and doing it at the bar , I decided to do it as music . ''
