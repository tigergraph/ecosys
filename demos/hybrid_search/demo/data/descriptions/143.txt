This rough-and-tumble , uptempo cut opens with the lines , `` You got the bullets , I got the gun/I got a hankerin ' for getting into something/I hit the bottle , you hit the gas/I heard your '65 can really haul some ass . ''
It finds Lambert revisiting the firearms theme she 's previously sung about on tracks such as `` Gunpowder & Lead '' and `` Time To Get a Gun . ''
Lambert penned the song with her Pistol Annies bandmate Angaleena Presley .
She told Billboard magazine : `` To me , that 's classic Miranda .
That 's a song everyone would expect to hear from me .
It 's one of my favorites . ''
The music video was shot in late June 2012 , and features a guest appearance by NASCAR driver Danica Patrick .
`` Danica was the person I thought of immediately when I envisioned the video , '' said Lambert .
`` We had so much fun playing two bad ass chicks up to no good .
Danica has a really busy schedule , and I 'm thrilled she was able to take time to come to Tennessee and be a part of this .
`` Actor W. Earl Brown , who is known for his role as the brother of Camera Diaz in the movie There 's Something About Mary , also appears in the clip .
`` Earl is a true character , and he brings so much charisma and authenticity to his scenes , '' said Lambert .
