This is the second single from British R&B singer Jay Sean 's American-debut album -LRB- third world-wide -RRB- , All or Nothing .
Sean Paul told MTV News : `` Jay Sean got a hot song and I got a hot eight bars on it .
He gave me fire , in the vein of ` Down , ' so of course I had to step to it . ''
When this entered the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 , Sean 's previous single , `` Down '' was still at # 7 on the chart .
This meant that the British singer became the first male soloist to double up in the Hot 100 's Top 10 with two titles from a debut release since 2003 , when Chingy 's first hit `` Right Thurr '' shared top tier space with follow-up `` Holidae In . ''
The song features Jamaican Reggae singer Sean Paul and Crunk artist Lil Jon .
Sean told MTV News that Paul 's contribution is largely due to their meeting in September 2009 on the MTV Video Music Awards red carpet .
He recalled : `` On the red carpet , doing an interview .
Sean Paul is over there and he goes , ` Yo !
Yeah man , Jay Sean ! '
And I said , ` Hi Sean ... Paul . '
This was the first time I 'd ever met him .
And he just said , ` Me and you need to work together . '
Two days later I called him and sent him the track , and sent it back to me the same day - and he was in Jamaica . ''
The `` block party '' music video was shot in Los Angeles on November 11 , 2009 , with Sean Paul and Lil Jon .
Cash Money / Young Money artists , Birdman and Tyga also made cameo appearances .
`` I love the idea of the street vibe , '' Sean said to MTV News .
`` Having folks together , out in the street at midnight .
The video is all about having fun , having a party , enjoying yourself .
So , we did the whole block-party thing ! ''
