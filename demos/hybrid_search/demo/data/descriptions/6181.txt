This was written about the death of Christine Gail Hinton , who was Crosby 's girlfriend , muse and partner .
Crosby explained to Mojo Magazine January 2008 why he wrote about such a tragic subject : `` I guess you can feel exposed but what else are you going to write about ?
If you are going to write and record material which moves people it needs to be pulled from real life .
You do n't really have a choice . ''
