Weller said on his website : `` Thematically , it ties in with the title track .
We 've got to reclaim our heritage and our culture .
Claim it back from the f -- ing politicians and the establishment . ''
Weller expanded on this song to The Independent April 24 , 2010 .
He described it as : `` A clarion call to wrest our country back from the Government 's hands .
I do n't want to make some grand political statement because I 'm still looking for answers myself .
But I think we settle for second best and we 're treated like c -- ts .
I have n't voted in the past two elections because they all look the same to me .
But I may have to revise that opinion this time ; I ca n't think who else to vote for but Labour . ''
Weller 's daughter Leah sung backing vocals .
She is his second child from his marriage to Wham !
and Style Council singer Dee C. Lee .
