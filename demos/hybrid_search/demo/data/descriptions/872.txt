Nicks reunited with her former beau and bandmate , Lindsey Buckingham , to perform on and help finish this track .
She told Billboard magazine it `` is truly my most sacred and revered song . ''
`` We recorded it live and did some harmonies , and then he did some little lead guitar things and it was perfect , '' she added .
`` There 's no other players , just me and him .
Not only did we create something that 's probably as Buckingham Nicks as we have been since 1973 , but ... I think that song really brought Lindsey and I back together .
He said to me as he was leaving on that second day , ' I feel like we 're closer than we 've been in 30 years . '
It certainly opens a lot of doors . ''
During a show at Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles on May 26 , 2011 , Nicks explained the genesis for this song was a day in 2005 , which she spent visiting wounded soldiers at a hospital .
On her way out , an emergency crew rushed in another set of the wounded .
`` I went in a girl and came out a changed woman , '' she told the audience .
The experience inspired her to write a poem .
Four years later she tried to turn it into a song after witnessing the media response in London to news , that seven British soldiers had been killed in Iraq .
Nicks spent close to a year fruitlessly trying to pen the tune before eventually turning to Buckingham for help .
