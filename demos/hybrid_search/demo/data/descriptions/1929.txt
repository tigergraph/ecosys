This song tells the tale of two twentieth century war photographers and their deaths in their line of work .
Polish-German Gerda Taro died when a tank collided into the side of a car she was riding on during the Spanish Civil War .
Taro 's Hungarian companion , Robert Capa , met his end after stepping on a mine in a hostile war zone in Indo-China .
`` It was only after reading all this that I discovered she was his love interest and they were engaged , '' frontman Joe Newman told the Guardian .
`` I liked those two and that story .
That really gripped me and I really trawled through as much as I could to get a good song out of it . ''
The song features additional vocals from St Ronan 's School Choir , who are based in an independent co-educational prep school near Hawkhurst in Kent .
The children also feature on the An Awesome Wave track `` Bloodflood . ''
Speaking to NME about this tune , Newman explained : `` The song 's about that period just before he steps on the landmine .
The two seconds before and two seconds after .
It 's a four-minute song about four seconds . ''
