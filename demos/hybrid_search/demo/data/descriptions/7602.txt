This Country-Rock stomper finds Swift reminiscing about a relationship that ran on `` New York time '' where for a short period , `` everywhere we stood is holy ground . ''
Regarding whom she is singing about , as far as we 're aware , two of Taylor 's exes were based in New York - Joe Jonas whom she had a relationship with in 2008 and Brokeback Mountain star Jake Gyllenhaal whom the songstress dated for about three months in late 2010 .
Jeff Bhasker , the man behind much of Kanye West 's , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy album , produced this song .
It is one of several tracks on Red that finds Swift collaborating with a variety of different writers and producers .
She told CMT News : `` This album was such an amazing experience because , for my last album , I just wrote it by myself .
And so this one , I wanted to approach it differently because I never want to make the same album twice .
So I would just call my songwriting and producing heroes and say , ` Hey , you want to work together ? '
And I got to work with some of my heroes , and I feel like I learned so much about other people 's processes and other people 's ways of doing things .
It 's so healthy as an artist to consistently put yourself in a room with people who are so different , style-wise , and so different in the way that they approach music than you are because it teaches you things .
It teaches you new tricks . ''
