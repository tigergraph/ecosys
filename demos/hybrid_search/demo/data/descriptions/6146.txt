Matt Davies-Kreye -LRB- vocals -RRB- told Kerrang !
magazine September 13 , 2008 the origins of this song : `` I think this was one of the first songs that was completed for the record from a bunch of ideas we had compiled during the last few tours of 2007 .
I remember thrashing the verse and chorus ideas around my house on a mini-Martin acoustic guitar that I love to write with .
The chorus really shone even on acoustic and the guys really liked where the song was going , so we sat down together and worked on a middle section and pre-chorus idea until it clicked . ''
Davies-Kreye told Kerrang !
: `` The song itself is about the power of words and how they can change the way you see the simplest of things . ''
