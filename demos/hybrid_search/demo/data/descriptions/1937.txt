This is the opening track from American rapper Nicki Minaj 's debut album , Pink Friday .
She explained the song 's meaning on her website : '' ` I 'm the Best ' is the intro to my album .
It chronicles my journey from underground rapper to border-line mainstream artist .
It speaks about the doubters in my life and it speaks about overcoming every challenge I was ever faced with .
It 's a toast to the girls who 've gone hard .
Who 've been told they 'd never make it .
It 's also the only song where I speak about my family and childhood .
Though hard to speak about at times , it 's necessary for my healing process . ''
