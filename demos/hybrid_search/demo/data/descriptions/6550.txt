This was the Scorpions ' breakout song in America , where it hit # 1 on the Mainstream Rock chart .
The band is from Germany , but had tremendous success in English-speaking countries , something that might have to do with their unusual perspective .
In our interview with Scorpions guitarist Rudolf Schenker , he explained : `` We had a big single with ` Nobody Like You ' in ' 82 .
People asked us , ` Why are you guys coming from Germany , and you have this # 1 single in the United States ?
What is this secret ? '
I said , ` Maybe it is because we see things in a different way .
We explain things differently , and we go very deep inside with the music and the lyrics , and we have a different view .
And people start liking this view because it 's not the same as the views of other people . ''
