This song was penned by Angaleena Presley many years before The Pistol Annies were formed .
She told Billboard magazine : `` When I first moved here , I dated this boy who worked on the railroad , he drove a big Chevy truck with a lift kit on it , and we 'd go up in the hills and go muddin ' .
One night he got his truck stuck and literally it sank down , and we had to get a backhoe to come up there and get it out .
That guy , he 's my dad , he 's their dad , he 's our uncles . ''
