This song is in the key of B , said Gilbert .
Is it about a real spaceship , or his car ?
Who knows , and when you can play guitar like this , who cares ?
The title track from this CD is simply an ego trip to exhibit the fretboard wizardry of one of the fastest guitarists on Earth .
It was apparently recorded `` live '' in the studio ; Gilbert , his drummer and bass player were dressed in space suits during the video they made for it , and were clearly having fun .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England -RRB- See Gilbert preparing for launch in Song Images .
