VH1 asked Jackson if she felt this song created the mold for her baby-making songs on her later albums .
She replied : `` I was just a baby myself when I did that .
I 've heard people say that that has kind of a Jackson feel , that it 's reminiscent of stuff my family 's done in the past , musically speaking .
I guess it does .
Thinking about it then , I did n't hear it , but thinking about it now , it kind of does .
It was just giving people a chance to see another side of me .
Just a little glimpse into a world that later they 'd see a lot . ''
Jazz bassist Stanley Clarke covered this song on his 1988 album If This Bass Could Only Talk .
This was another song penned by the songwriting/producing duo Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , along with Janet Jackson .
With the Control album , Jam and Lewis helped the singer shatter her image as the Jackson family 's sweet little sister and introduced a sexy young woman ready to show the world her true identity with an innovative blend of R&B , Funk , Disco and Rap - and a heavy dose of sex appeal .
