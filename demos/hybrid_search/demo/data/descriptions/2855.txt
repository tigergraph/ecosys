During the writing of Days Go By , frontman Dexter Holland decided that as most of the material was heavy and serious , he needed to pen a couple of more whimsical tunes .
`` Secret Family '' is one of them .
He told Spinner : `` The idea of a secret family is something I 've heard about .
You always hear the story of a pilot who has families in different countries .
The other family is his ` secret family . '
It 's a funny thing to sing about .
In this story , it 's a guy who goes into a strip club .
The idea is he 's so infatuated with this girl he wants to have a secret family with her .
It 's not a nice compliment , but the guy in the song assumes it is . ''
