Man On The Moon is a concept album split into five acts about a journey through Cleveland rapper Kid Cudi 's consciousness .
Boomy-voiced rapper Common narrates it and this thoughtful track sets the scene .
HipHopDX.com asked Mescudi what the `` moon '' in the album title and cover art represents .
He explained : `` The moon is pretty much my place of peace , whether it 's a room or my mind .
It 's really your own personal space .
It could be interpreted any different way .
I did n't wan na have it so literal .
I want kids to interpret it and find their own moon in their world . ''
Kid Cudi -LRB- real name Scott Mescudi -RRB- 's father passed away from cancer when he was eleven-years-old .
His death had a significant effect on both his personality and music .
In this song Mescudi notes that , `` Since my father died , I ai n't been right since . ''
He told HipHopDX.com : `` It 's definitely important to me to make mention of my father because I think that does play a major part in why I am who I am , like my character and how I think and how I move in life .
And this album was my way of finally letting out a lot of feelings that I 've yet to even mention to my mother . ''
On this track , Cudi sings that he 'd like to experience `` carefree living like Jay-Z . ''
Djbooth.net asked the rapper if he feels such an aim is truly realistic for an artist .
He replied : `` I wrote that song from an ignorant standpoint , man -- I wanted to have ignorance be the undertone of the whole song .
And it really is to show what one thinks when his back is up against the wall .
It 's really to flip Jay 's line and kind of use it in my favor .
It worked -- it 's the only way I could 've explained the situation . ''
