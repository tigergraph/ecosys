Little Green is about the child that Joni Mitchell gave up for adoption in 1965 .
Mitchell explained in a 1998 interview with Toronto Globe and Mail : `` I was dirt poor .
An unhappy mother does not raise a happy child .
It was difficult parting with the child , but I had to let her go . ''
Joni and her daughter were reunited in 1997 .
-LRB- thanks , Todd - Atlanta , GA -RRB- Mitchell 's daughter Kelly Dale Anderson was born February 19 , 1965 .
Mitchell chose the name Kelly after the color kelly green , which represented spring - thus the song 's title .
Kelly 's adoptive parents David and Ida Gibb renamed her Kilauren .
