This song skips from one cultural reference to the next .
It touches on social discontent -LRB- `` Twenty years of schoolin ' / And they put you on the day shift '' -RRB- , drug busts -LRB- `` The phone 's tapped anyway/Maggie says that many say/They must bust in early May/Orders from the D.A. '' -RRB- , violent policing witnessed at civil rights protests -LRB- `` Better stay away from those/That carry around a fire hose '' -RRB- and the fight against authority -LRB- `` Do n't follow leaders/Watch the parkin ' meters '' -RRB- .
John Lennon was apparently so captivated by this song , he worried he would never be able to write anything that could compete with it .
American radical left group , the Weathermen , got their name from the lyric `` You do n't need a weatherman/To know which way the wind blows . ''
The promotional clip for this song is arguably one of the most famous music videos of all time .
Shot in 1965 as part of the documentary Do n't Look Back -LRB- chronicling his tour of England -RRB- , it features Dylan standing in an alley behind the Savoy Hotel in London .
He is holding cue cards , which he flips through as the song progresses .
On the cards are select phrases from the song 's lyrics , often with purposeful misspellings .
These cue cards were written by Dylan along with the Folk singer Donovan , the musician Bob Neuwirthand , and the beat poet Allen Ginsberg -LRB- these latter two can be seen in the actual video , standing just behind Dylan -RRB- .
This video has been spoofed countless times - notable parodies include Weird Al Yankovic 's video for the song `` BOB , '' INXS ' `` Mediate , '' and Les Claypool 's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade 's `` Buzzards of Green Hill . ''
The lyrics resemble a stream of consciousness , a writing technique championed by beat poets such as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg , both of whom were a major influence on Dylan .
Musically , Dylan told the LA Times the song was inspired by Chuck Berry : `` It 's from Chuck Berry , a bit of ` Too Much Monkey Business ' and some of the scat songs of the forties . ''
Musicians continue to allude to this song today .
Jet named their 2003 breakthrough album Get Born after the song 's lyric `` Ah get born , keep warm . ''
Radiohead alluded to the track on the album , OK Computer , which features a song titled `` Subterranean Homesick Blues . ''
The Gaslight Anthem 's song , `` Angry Johnny and the Radio '' includes the lines `` I 'm still here singin ' thinking about the government '' and `` Are you hidin ' in a basement mixin ' up the medicine ? ''
both of which are referring to the opening lyrics to `` Subterranean Homesick Blues '' : `` Johnny 's in the basement mixing up the medicine/I 'm on the pavement thinkin ' about the Government . ''
Artists to have covered this song , meanwhile , include Red Hot Chili Peppers , Harry Nilsson and Glenn Campbell .
This was Dylan 's first ever Top 40 hit , peaking at # 39 on the US chart .
Bringing It All Back Home is Bob Dylan 's fifth album .
The record is divided into an electric and an acoustic side .
This introduction of electronic instruments lead to Dylan becoming increasingly alienated from the folk community .
Furthermore , the album saw Dylan withdraw from protest songs to instead write on more abstract , personal issues .
