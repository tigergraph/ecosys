This is the title track of the second studio album by American Rock band Mayday Parade .
Frontman Derek Sanders explained to Artist Direct why the band named the album after this track : `` That song originally was n't going to be called ` Anywhere But Here , ' '' he said .
`` It was just going to be called ` Secret Love ' because that 's the first line of the chorus , but then we did n't want to have ` Kids in Love ' and ` Secret Love . '
So we changed the name of the song to ` Anywhere But Here ' because that was obviously a line of the chorus .
We liked it enough and we were like , ` That 's a cool title for the CD too ! '
It went from the lyrics in the song to the title of the track to the title of the record . ''
