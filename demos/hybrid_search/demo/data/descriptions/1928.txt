This Tom Nichols and Kirsty Roper penned song was originally intended to be sung by Roper , who was a solo performer signed to Nichols ' manager Gary Davis ' label .
However , when it was played to Tracy Bennett , an executive at London Records , he decided that he wanted the song for All Saints .
Co-songwriter Tom Nichols said in 1000 UK # 1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh : `` William Orbit produced it and it came out sounding fantastic .
It was completely different from the demo . ''
Former Miss UK Kirsty Roper married Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli , the same year that she wrote this song .
After putting her career on hold for ten years to raise their three children , Roper launched her first album Elusive in Switzerland , where it went straight into the top 20 of the album charts .
Not that she needs the money , she shares an estimated # 7.4 billion fortune with Bertarelli and is said to be Britain 's richest woman .
The song was commercially successful becoming The All Saints fourth UK # 1 single and also reaching the top ten in several other countries , including Ireland , Italy , Sweden and New Zealand .
The song 's music video was shot by Johan Renck , and contained scenes of a couple arguing with each other with each All Saint appearing beside them at various points .
None of the girls appeared together as they were n't speaking to each other at the time .
It also featured special effects very similar to the Bullet Time effect used in the movie The Matrix , which was state of the art at the time .
