This track features Alter Bridge singer Myles Kennedy .
Slash recalled to Musicradar.com : `` This particular song was the one I thought was the best on the record in terms of the way it was arranged and the music and everything .
I could n't figure out who would be right vocalist and all of a sudden Myles Kennedy just popped into my head .
I contacted him and I sent him the song , and a couple of days later he sent me back a demo of the lyrics and vocals he 'd written , and it was f -- king amazing .
I was really excited to record that .
I wanted to get Jack White , but he did n't want to sing .
He said I 'll play drums , I 'll play guitar , but I do n't wan na sing .
He was one guy that I wanted to work with .
Pretty much everyone else that I went after I managed to get .
It turned out to probably be a blessing because Myles really fit that song .
Jack would 've fit it too but it would have been a different kind of a trip . ''
