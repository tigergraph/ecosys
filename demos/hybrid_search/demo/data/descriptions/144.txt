Brown addresses potential paramours on this Messengers produced ballad , in which asks them not to judge him by his chequered past but to , `` take me as I am . ''
Later on he admits , `` I wo n't deny what they 're saying .
Because most of it is true . ''
The song is one of several tracks on Fortune that finds Brown returning to his rhythm-and-blues roots after releasing a series of Hip-Hop and EDM tunes .
`` It was important for me to go back to the basis of what people love me for , and that was my R&B , '' he explained to MTV News .
`` You know , the ` crooner ' kind of record , '' he added with a smile .
`` So , on this album , you get to see the different textures within Chris Brown .
But I think all in all , you get that R&B guy again , you get the love songs and the more intimate songs . ''
