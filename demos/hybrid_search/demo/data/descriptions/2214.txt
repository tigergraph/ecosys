The first full offering from English singer-songwriter Laura Marling 's third album , A Creature I Do n't Know , is an ode to a mythical deity .
She explained to the NME : `` There 's an idea that Sophia is God 's female counterpoint .
I became quite obsessed with that .
She was a woman who kept men in check and told them off for doing nasty things . ''
Marling told NME that she became fascinated by the academic theory that Sophia is God 's female counterpoint .
`` It was a really fascinating idea that God had this kind of ... moral nag , '' she explained .
`` Those really conflicting ideas of femininity I found really interesting .
How can this kind of very sexual being with the long blonde hair be seen as angelic ?
That 's something I always find really difficult , this kind of idea of sexualising women and kind of putting them in a maternal role and where do they fit in ?
I find it all wonderfully confusing -LRB- laughs -RRB- . ''
For those of you without a theology degree , `` Sophia '' is the ancient Greek word for wisdom and in Christian theology is used to describe the higher wisdom of God .
Gnosticism , which is a set of religious beliefs and practices that integrates aspects of Christianity , Ancient Greek philosophy , Hinduism and Buddhism sees Sophia as a feminine figure , allied to the human soul but also simultaneously one of the feminine aspects of God .
This song was inspired by Robertson Davies 's novel Rebel Angels , `` which is about God 's female counterpart , '' explained Marling .
`` In the book she was this nagging figure , God 's guilt , basically , keeping him on his toes , and I thought that was absolutely brilliant .
So it 's an homage to Sophia , and to the idea of the feminine divine -- which comes up in ` The Beast ' too .
And it 's kind of two fingers up , and meant to be funny . ''
