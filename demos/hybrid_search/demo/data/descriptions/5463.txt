This Tony Martin and Josh Thompson penned song is the opening track of Set You Free , which Allan sequenced to be a break-up album .
He explained to American Songwriter magazine : `` It starts with ` Tough Goodbye ' and goes through anger and whiskey and all the things that would go along with a good break up .
Then it winds you out with ` Good As New . ' ''
