Faith Evans and Mary J. Blige both sing on this .
Both were up and coming R&B artists who were signed to Diddy 's Bad Boy Record label .
Blige went on to massive success , as Diddy promoted her as `` The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul . ''
Evans eventually married Notorious B.I.G. .
This samples DeBarge 's song `` Stay With Me . ''
