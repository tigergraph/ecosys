This wounded power ballad is a collaboration between Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler , keyboard player Russ Irwin and Marti Frederiksen , who has worked with the band since the mid-1990s .
The song finds Tyler wailing about a failed relationship : `` Marti and I had both been through divorce : Do you ever have feelings about that ?
Do you ever think about that ? ''
Tyler told Rolling Stone .
`` It started from there : ` What could have been love , it should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be , could n't see what was right in front of me . '
So many people are getting divorced now .
When you 've got kids , you still love the mother a little bit .
Anyone worth their soul will admit it . ''
The song was Aerosmith 's first entry on Billboard 's Adult Contemporary chart since 1998 , when `` I Do n't Want To Miss A Thing '' reached # 13 .
Both Russ Irwin and Marti Frederiksen also sing backup vocals on this tune .
Irwin , while never an official member of the band , wrote songs with the band and has toured with them on keyboards since the '80s .
In 2012 , he released a solo album called Get Me Home , which featured contributions from Steven Tyler .
