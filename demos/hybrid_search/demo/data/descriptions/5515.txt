A fan of fantasy games and movies such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter , Eric Hutchinson is a self-confessed dork .
The Washington DC-born singer admits on this cut that he 'll never be cool .
`` There 's a line in the song where I say , ` Cool people , maybe they 're just born with it , ' Hutchinson told Aol Music - `` that 's sort of how I feel .
I tried so hard for so long to be cool .
Then there 's sort of your own personal cool . ''
