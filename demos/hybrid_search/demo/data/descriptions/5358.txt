This song features the legendary Rock singer-songwriter and guitarist Lou Reed .
Q magazine January 2008 asked The Killers if they were scared when they met the notoriously grumpy Reed .
Frontman Brandon Flowers replied , `` You tend to be respectful .
It 's a respectful fear .
It took a day to break the ice with him .
The second day of recording was a lot nicer than the first - on the first day we were all really stiff .
It 's funny because you refer to him as `` Lou Reed , '' not `` Lou . ''
I remember somebody came into the studio .
They could only stay in the room with him for 2 minutes .
They left saying , `` Lou Reed 's really freaking me out .
`` Guitarist Dave Keuning added : `` He 's got his own vibe .
We asked him to work on ` Tranquilize ' with us .
We sent him the track and he said yes .
It was a real honor , but we 've learnt that if you try asking , it works out sometimes .
`` On a similar vein Flowers revealed to the Daily Mail December 7 , 2007 : `` At first , I felt that Lou was testing us .
But after a day , I think we passed the test .
He wanted to know whether we were using real drums .
Thankfully we were , so that was fine .
Those were the sorts of things he hounded us on .
We had to work for his approval , but in the end he was great . ''
This won Best International Alternative/Indie Track at NME 's first ever USA awards .
-LRB- thanks , Kylie - Ventura , CA -RRB- Flowers told the New Musical Express October 20 , 2007 : `` It 's one of our more depressing songs , there 's a desperation to it , but there 's light at the end of the tunnel . ''
