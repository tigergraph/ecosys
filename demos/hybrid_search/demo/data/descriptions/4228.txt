The three Genesis band members - Tony Banks , Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford - wrote the music to this song , and Rutherford wrote the lyrics .
The Duke album was the first where the band wrote the songs together , typically by working up the tracks in improvised jams .
Once an arrangement emerged , one member of the band would then take on the lyrics .
Rutherford , whose other lyrical contributions with Genesis include `` Follow You , Follow Me '' and `` Land Of Confusion , '' says that he writes the `` simple '' songs for the band , although fans may disagree .
`` Turn It On Again '' begins , `` All I need is a TV show , '' and then talks about the familiar characters on television that give the singer comfort .
Rutherford might find the lyrics simple , but they explore an interesting theme : how we can work up imaginary relationships with the folks with see on TV while putting aside our real friends and family .
In England , where the band was much more popular , this was released as a single before the album .
In the US the single , which did not chart , came out six months after the album was released .
Genesis recorded this at Polar Studios in Sweden , which is owned by Abba .
This continued Genesis ' transformation from theatrical , progressive rock to radio-friendly pop .
Many of their core fans felt they were selling out , but they had huge commercial success as a result .
The Duke album was the first where the band used a drum machine .
This helped Phil Collins focus on singing and songwriting .
`` Turn It On Again '' is the title to Genesis ' 1999 Greatest Hits album .
This is the first track .
