This is a track from 12 Song Program , the debut solo album from Tony Sly , the frontman of Californian punk band No Use For A Name .
Sly told Spin magazine about this folk-inspired number of introspective longing , which is backed by acoustic guitars , accordion , and sweeping strings .
`` This song is about the inevitable and constant consumption of alcohol that goes along with being on the road , '' he said .
`` It 's supposed to make tours seem shorter , but it 's a method that does n't really work and is terrible for your liver . ''
