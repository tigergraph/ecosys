According to press materials , The Big To-Do is themed loosely around crime and -LRB- self - -RRB- punishment .
This song , for instance , is both a true story , which was seen on Court TV , and the closest frontman Patterson Hood -LRB- the son of bassist David Hood of the famed Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section -RRB- has come to making the movie he started out to make a decade or more back .
The song tells the true story of a Tennessee woman who killed her God-less church-minister husband .
Hood told Gibson.com why he decided to write a song about the court case : `` That story seemed to be following me around .
I was in Norway when it broke , and it was news even over there .
A year later I was in Mississippi , with the TV on , and they were showing the court proceedings .
They pulled out the wig , the go-go boots , and other things -LSB- the pastor -RSB- would make her wear .
You could actually hear the gasp in the room , as if it were an episode of Perry Mason .
I knew then that I was going to write a song about it . ''
