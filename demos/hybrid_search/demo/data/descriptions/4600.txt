Tempah explains on this aspirational track how his huge musical ambitions and confidence led to him being accepted by the grime boys of east London .
The rapper told The Sun September 24 , 2010 : `` At the time , urban music was still very much underground .
And it was very cliquey .
A lot of the underground artists went to the same schools or were from the same areas .
I was just ` that kid from south London . '
Fitting in and trying to be one of the lads and respected was a very difficult thing for a long time .
But it was where it was happening and I got into pirate radio and mix tapes and it all started . ''
