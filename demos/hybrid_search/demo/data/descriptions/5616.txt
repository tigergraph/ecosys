This almost-instrumental vignette is the latter half of an older song the band had .
Frontman Jonathan Higgs explained to The Line Of Best Fit : `` It was n't quite up to scratch for the record and it made the whole thing a bit too long .
`` Bassist Jeremy Pritchard added : `` When we first drew up the album tracklist ' _ ARC _ ' was not on it but sonically it is a kind of a plateau in the middle of the record .
It actually makes the album a slightly easier listen . ''
Speaking to NME about the concept behind the album , Pritchard said that the title predicts the end of the world as we know it .
`` It has the biggest theme of all : the coming environmental disaster .
The arc of the title is the arc of the shape of human civilization - I think we 're at the beginning of the downward curve . ''
