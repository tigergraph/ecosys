The opening track of J. Cole 's debut album is the third of a series of songs with the same title detailing his artistic struggle .
The previous two ` Dollar and a Dream ' tracks appeared on his earlier mixtapes , The Come Up and The Warm Up .
`` Just to be able to start the album with the third -LSB- song -RSB- in a series does a lot , because it 's an instant connection with the fans who have been there for a while , '' Cole told Billboard magazine .
`` And -LSB- it prompts -RSB- the new people to go back and do their homework . ''
