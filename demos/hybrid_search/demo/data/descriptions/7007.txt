Gabrielle recorded this song for the soundtrack to the film Bridget Jones 's Diary .
Released as a single , it became a worldwide hit , topping the charts in Spain and reaching the Top 10 in many other countries including the UK , Australia and New Zealand .
The Kevin Godley directed video features Gabrielle singing the song whilst wearing dark sunglasses and a large black leather jacket , intercut with clips from Bridget Jones 's Diary .
The singer has never been confident about her appearances in music promos .
She told The Independent in 2013 : `` I love other people 's music videos With my own , I 've always said to the director , `` Ca n't you put other people in them ? ''
I do n't think I 'm good at performing -LSB- in them -RSB- .
I particularly hate the one for ` Out of Reach ' ; I look awful in that video -- just horrific ! ''
