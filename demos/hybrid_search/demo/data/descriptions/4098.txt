Patti Smith based this '60s - flavored ballad on a poem she had written about Amy Winehouse after her death at the age of 27 in July 2011 .
Smith told Uncut magazine : `` The little song for Amy just blossomed in the studio .
We were at -LSB- New York studio -RSB- Electric Lady doing a whole other song and I wrote Amy a little poem when she died and my bass player , Tony Shanahan , wrote a piece of music and the two matched perfectly . ''
Smith told Spin magazine she did n't actually know Winehouse , `` I wrote it out of respect for her artistry and her youth . ''
