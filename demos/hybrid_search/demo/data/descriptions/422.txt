`` My daughters and I were watching a documentary on Yellowstone , which talked about how the volcano erupted 600,000 years ago and covered a third of North America in ash , '' he explained to Rolling Stone .
`` My daughter said , ` Would that kill us ? '
I said , ` There 's a far greater chance human beings wo n't survive long enough to see the next time it erupts . ' ''
