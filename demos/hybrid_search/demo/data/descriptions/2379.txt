In our interview with Mutemath drummer , Darren King , it was revealed this song is about the paranoia which can emerge from a religious upbringing : `` That song is all about how we were raised .
You 're raised in this scene where there 's a lot of talk of demons and you just talk of the Rapture , and as a kid , when a little airplane would fly overhead and you 'd hear the sound , I would literally run and go check to see if my mom was still there , because I wanted to make sure that that sonic boom was n't the Rapture .
And if it was , I knew my mom would be gone for sure , because she was the best person I knew .
So if Mom got raptured , and I 'm still around , then I 'm in trouble .
So it was this paranoia .
Or if you look at a dirty magazine for the first time when you 're 11 or 12 , and then for the rest of that year you wonder if you 're going to go to hell -- that 's a true story of mine -- and then toil over that .
And then I went back to the gas station and I tried to apologize to the gas station attention for looking at the dirty magazine , and it was a completely different person that owned the place , they did n't have dirty magazines anymore .
Weird stuff like that . ''
`` Walking Paranoia '' features on Odd Soul , Mutemath 's third album .
King told us the entire record carries this theme of religious upbringing and social awkwardness : `` Well , to me , it represents the idea that I 'm strange .
I mean , I remember growing up as a kid thinking that to be me , to be a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant teen , growing up in Missouri , was sort of the absence of culture .
I thought that I was raised with a blank canvas regarding culture and that I had nothing in that regard .
And then as I get older , I do start to see it differently .
And I bear both this pride and also embarrassment for who I am culturally and religiously .
And I feel strange .
I feel like a weird person . ''
