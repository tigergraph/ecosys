Vocalist Simon Neil told Kerrang !
magazine about this semi-mystical anthem : `` We played this during some of our summer shows .
It 's about that feeling where you can almost do anything if you stick together .
`` He added : `` There 's a lyric , ` We can change the world , despite our enemies fighting on if you listen to your heart and sing .
Pray for love , it feels like a memory .
But if we hold on , there 's a victory over the sun . '
It 's about seeing the light through the darkness . ''
Simon Neil told NME : `` It 's about pleading with someone you love to sort themselves out .
It makes you wan na dance . ''
