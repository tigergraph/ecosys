Love The Future was released on Star Trak Entertainment , a record label founded by Pharrell Williams and his production partner Chad Hugo .
Instrumentalist Maxwell Drummey recalled to Complex Magazine that this song nearly did n't make the album .
He explained : `` When we first presented the album to Pharrell and Chad we left that off because we thought they were going to have beef with it .
As soon we were done playing it for them , Pharrell asked , ` Why do n't you put that super slow one on it ? '
And we were like , ` Alright cool ! ' ''
