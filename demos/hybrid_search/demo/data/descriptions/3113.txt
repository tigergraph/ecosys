Some lyric interpretation : `` Jesus Christ , that 's a pretty face , the kind you 'd find on someone that could save . ''
- Jesus died for our sins but he would find it hard to believe that he got into heaven .
`` And I will die all alone , and when I arrive I wo n't know anyone . ''
- None of his friends will be where he goes in heaven or hell .
`` Well , Jesus Christ , I 'm alone again , so what did you do those three days you were dead ?
Cause this problem 's gon na last more than the weekend . ''
- Jesus died and was in hell for three days : Friday , Saturday and Sunday .
So what he is saying is he is going through struggles and he wants to know how Jesus got through his hard times .
`` Well , Jesus Christ , I 'm not scared of dying , I 'm a little bit scared of what comes after .
Do I get the gold chariot ? ''
- This is referring to the Bible were Elijah the prophet ascended to heaven in a chariot of fire .
`` And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands ? ''
- When Jesus was resurrected , Thomas needed proof that it was really him , so he asked to see the scars from the nails that nailed him onto the cross .
`` I 've had some time , O Lord , to hone my lying technique '' - We will never know when our time to go is and that he might not be ready at this moment .
`` So do you think that we could work out a sign so I 'll know it 's you and that it 's over so I wo n't even try . ''
- This is asking Jesus to tell him when he is beyond saving so he can stop trying to be good and just give in .
He knows that the time will come for Jesus to come and that everyone has sinned and we all fall short of God .
