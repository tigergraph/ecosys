In this song Ross pays tribute to rapper MC Hammer , who placed 10 entries on the Hot 100 between 1989 and 1994 , including his signature hit , `` U Ca n't Touch This . ''
How does Hammer feel about the tribute ?
`` Arguably , right now , -LRB- Ross is -RRB- the hottest dude in the game .
He 's spitting fire , '' said the MC in Billboard magazine .
`` For a cat on that level , with his skill set , to have a record called ` MC Hammer , ' because it pays a lot of respect and homage to what I laid down , you ca n't help but be honored by that.I done got every award that a man can get in the music business , every one .
I got 'em all .
Diamond awards , Grammys , American Music Awards , People 's Choice Awards , you name it .
Everything that you can do and every accolade you can receive .
But that record that Ross did is on the level of all that .
That 's how it feels to me . ''
