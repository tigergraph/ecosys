The songs from Dar Williams ' ninth studio album , In the Time of Gods , borrow from classic tales of Ancient Greece , but the singer-songwriter weaves in her own personal experiences .
Williams wrote this song for her husband , with whom she shares a Hudson Valley home .
`` When I go on the road , there 's an understanding that it is part of our relationship , '' she said .
`` In the Parthenon , there is one goddess - Vesta , goddess of the hearth - who sits in the middle of the hall stoking the fire .
I never thought that I needed a hearth , but that 's my home , and also my marriage , an anchor in my life that just gets better all the time . ''
