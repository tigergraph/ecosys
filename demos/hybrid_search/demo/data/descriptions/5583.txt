This was used in the movie Clerks .
The director Kevin Smith also directed the video , which featured the movie 's characters Jay and Silent Bob .
Smith and Soul Asylum got to be friends ; the band 's song `` We 3 '' was used at the end of Smith 's 1997 movie Chasing Amy and `` Misery '' was used in the 2006 sequel Clerks II .
Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum told us : `` When I was first watching Clerks , the dialogue was so sharp and so smart , that at the time all I could really associate it with was noir , like old Hollywood where there were so many words .
Nowadays it seems like you ca n't get away with that many words because Bruce Willis needs to do so many things in an action sequence .
It seemed like Kevin was flying in the face of all that .
That sort of rich dialogue is what informed the Seth Rogans and the Jonah Hills and the more intelligent , more sarcastic , more foul-mouthed characters in movies that are smart .
And that 's a big deal .
So to that effect I 'll always be a huge fan of Kevin .
I just think he 's a great intellectual with a great sense of humor .
And that does n't happen all the time . ''
