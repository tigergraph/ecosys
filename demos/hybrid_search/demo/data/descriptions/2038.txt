`` Dreamlover '' was built around a sample of The Emotions ' 1970 track `` Blind Alley . ''
The Emotions ' Soul tune was previously sampled by the rapper Big Daddy Kane on his 1988 track `` Ai n't No Half-Steppin ' . ''
Carey 's vocal performance , like many others of her earlier recordings , was inspired by Minnie Riperton , an American singer and songwriter noted for her five octave vocal range .
Riperton is best known for her 1974 international hit `` Lovin ' You . ''
In the same Billboard interview Carey discussed her songwriting technique : `` For each album , I try to have a book that I write the whole thing in .
It started - this was a long time ago .
I do n't have birthdays , I only have anniversaries .
-LRB- laughs -RRB- But actually , this was the last birthday party I had ... I think it was my 21st birthday , even though I 'm only 12 .
We had it in advance .
-LRB- laughs -RRB- Cyndi Lauper came to the party , and I 've always been a big fan of hers since I was growing up .
She gave me this book , and I wound up writing the whole Music Box album in this book , which I still have . ''
In the US , this was the biggest hit of 1993 , according to Billboard .
This marked the start of a trend for Carey using samples as backbones for some of the songs .
She told Billboard magazine in 2008 : `` I hate it when people are like -LRB- uses a dramatic voice -RRB- : ` She 's taking a new direction with Hip-Hop . '
I 'm like , ` Will you please freakin ' research ? '
I 've been doing this for a long time - working with -LRB- writer-producer -RRB- Dave Hall on `` Dreamlover , '' using the ` Ai n't No Half-Steppin '' loop.I think that it was Q-Tip - he said this to me in '97 - that I was really the catalyst for so many of these artists who are now trying to infuse -LRB- songs with Hip-Hop -RRB- .
It was just digging in the crates with Dave Hall and coming up with , ` Hey , let 's use this loop ! '
And from then on , I did it anytime I could . ''
