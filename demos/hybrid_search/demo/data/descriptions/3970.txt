This jazz-frosted song finds Bush singing about falling for a snowman who melts away after a night of passion .
She wakes up the next morning with wet sheets and a pile of twigs .
The singer admitted to The Washington Post that she ca n't explain where such songs come from .
Said Bush : `` By that point I had really homed in on writing about snow .
It 's like , where does anything come from ?
That 's the fascinating thing about creative work .
One minute it 's not there , the next minute it is . ''
