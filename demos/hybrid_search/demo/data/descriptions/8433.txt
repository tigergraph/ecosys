This track is # 6 on the album Figure Number Five .
The album was going to be named after this song instead of the third track off the album -LRB- `` Figure Number Five '' -RRB- , but the band decided against that as this would give hints that soilwork were breaking up .
-LRB- thanks , Jason - Hamilton , New Zealand -RRB-
