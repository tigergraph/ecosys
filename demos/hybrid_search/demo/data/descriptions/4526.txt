This was written for the 1975 movie Cooley High , which is about a predominately black high school .
In the film , it 's used to reflect the powerful emotions that many students feel when high school ends and they must move on .
The feelings described in the song apply to anyone who must leave something behind , and it is often used at funerals .
It appears in the funeral scene of the movie Lethal Weapon 3 .
The original version used in the movie was sung by G.C. Cameron , who was a member of The Spinners before the group left Motown records and he stayed with the label as a solo artist .
This 1975 version hit # 35 in the US .
Boyz II Men were signed to Motown Records , and Cooleyhighharmony , which was named after the movie Cooley High , was their first album .
The group met at the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts , and their a cappella recording of this song helped establish Boyz II Men as a classic vocal group similar to the Doo Wop groups of the '50s that often started singing in high school .
It was their second single after `` Motownphilly , '' which introduced Boyz II Men as a Philadelphia group with a classic Motown sound , and included an interlude by Michael Bivens where he described the origins of the band .
The marketing was authentic and it worked , as the group scored 5 # 1 hits in the '90s and established themselves as one of the top vocal groups of all time .
They quickly became more famous than their mentor Michael Bivens , who was a member of New Edition and Bell Biv Devoe .
This was written by the Motown producer and songwriter Freddie Perren and his wife , Christine Yarian .
Perren co-wrote many hits of the '60s and '70s , including `` ABC , '' `` I Will Survive '' and `` More Than A Woman . ''
Boyz II Men dedicated performances of this song to their tour manager , Khalil Roundtree , after he was murdered in Chicago when the band was on tour with MC Hammer in 1992 .
