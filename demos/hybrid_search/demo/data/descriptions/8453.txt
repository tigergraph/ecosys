The Gaslight Anthem vocalist and songwriter Brian Fallon was inspired to write this song after attending a solo show by Soundgarden singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell .
He explained to Artist Direct : `` I went to see one of Chris Cornell 's solo acoustic shows at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank , NJ .
I saw his name on the marquee , and I was like , ` I 've got to go ! '
I got in , and he was awesome .
He was really on fire !
He just killed it .
When I got home , I was really buzzed on the whole vibe of his show .
I used some Soundgarden-style weird chords I saw him play that I never really learned before .
I watched his hands and thought , ` Look at that chord !
I wonder if it would sound good with these chords I normally use . '
It was a cool growing thing .
That song came out really quickly in about 20 minutes .
It was a good stride . ''
Whilst The Gaslight Anthem 's first three albums were steeped in Americana , Handwritten is rooted in frontman Brian Fallon 's own experiences .
`` Now I am no angel but I got nothing to hide , '' he rasps on this brooding track .
`` Can you say the same thing for yourself tonight ? ''
`` It 's supposed to be a letter to whoever is listening , '' explained the singer .
`` Like , this is what we got beat up by and maybe you did too .
There 's so many things that I just never wrote about , real personal stuff that I just was n't ready to talk about yet .
Now I think being an adult I have some reflection on it . ''
