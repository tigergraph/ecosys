Johnette Napolitano 's lyrics are littered with spiritual references in which she equates religion with personal salvation or emotional love .
Here she sings , `` Some call it Allah .
Some call it God .
Some call it Buddah .
I call it Love . ''
Speaking about her religious beliefs in an interview with Happening , Napolitano said : '' I 'm always asking questions , which is what we 're here to do .
Question everything around us .
I have a Catholic background but I lean towards the Tao and Buddhist philosophies .
I look to the Eastern religions , especially when I 'm in a quandary .
They make more sense to me , they explore the cycles of life - the ups and downs .
It 's the cycle of birth and death , day and night .
In the end , you choose to live or die .
As good as something is going for you today , you have to realize that the equal force can be returned to you tomorrow , and you have to accept that as a way of life . ''
