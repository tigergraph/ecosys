F.R. David -LRB- birth name Elli Robert Fitoussi -RRB- is a Tunisian-born French singer .
He began his career as singer and guitarist with French garage band Les Trèfles , who mutated into Les Boots , but achieved very little commercial success .
Fitoussi went solo in 1967 and enjoyed minor hits with the Éric Charden penned `` Symphonie '' and a cover of The Bee Gees ' `` Sir Geoffrey Saved the World . ''
He worked with Vangelis in the early 1970s , appearing as vocalist on some of the Greek electronic musician 's early solo recordings , and then joined rock outfit Les Variations in 1974 , the only French band signed direct to an American label .
`` We had two managers , it was too much , '' Fitoussi recalled to Mojo magazine in 2012 .
One of those managers was David Krebs whose other clients included Aerosmith.Kerbs ' eyes were on David , who he thought had potential .
After the band folded , David was back in France .
He remembered to Mojo : `` Krebs wanted me to write more melodic songs than Variations , to change , to quit the rock .
Among the demos I had was ` Words . '
It could remind you of Roy Orbison , It 's a mellow song , but the reactions were so strong .
They made me an offer I could n't refuse .
But it synthesized a lot of experiences I had . ''
The plaintive ballad reached # 2 in Britain in the spring of 1983 .
The song 's eventual UK success was caused by its exposure on BBC TV 's Top of the Pops .
The disc was featured on the first edition of a special Euro-slot incorporated in the program .
The demo was issued as a single , whereupon it ascended the French charts .
It went on to sell 8 million records across the world , topping charts around Europe in late 1982 .
The song also went to # 1 in South Africa and spent 25 weeks on the charts there .
It remains his most well known song .
Fitoussi told Mojo he was `` caught in such a big promotion , but I did n't feel like following the big hit .
I never want to do the same thing the next time . ''
