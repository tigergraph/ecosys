In this song frontman and songwriter Brian Fallon draws on his own life to articulate feelings of loss .
He explained to Musicradar.com : `` Loss is the first thing I knew .
I was born into loss .
My mother had me and raised me .
So I did n't have two parents like all the other kids in my neighborhood .
I remember going , ` Wait , Johnny down the street has a mom and a dad - where 's my dad ? '
And then you go to school and you feel like you do n't fit in .
That kind of stuff puts a real indelible stamp on a child.Thankfully , my mom remarried , and my stepfather was very cool .
He pretty much taught me everything I know about surviving in this world .
But we moved around a lot because of their jobs , so I wound up going to all these different schools .
Again , I never felt like I belonged ; I was always the new kid.Losing people was a way of life for me .
Any time somebody came into my life , I had to view them as temporary because I knew that I was probably going to be yanked away from them soon .
It plays with your head .
Most kids were looking to the future and thinking about what they were going to gain , whereas I looked ahead and all I could think was , What am I going to lose next ? ''
