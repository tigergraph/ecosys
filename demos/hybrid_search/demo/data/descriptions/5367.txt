This is a tribute to women who stick by their men through good times and bad .
This samples `` Angel Of The Morning , '' a hit for Merrilee Rush in 1968 and Juice Newton in 1981 .
They got the idea when Rikrok came into the studio singing it .
Shaggy put the beat together before adding lyrics to this .
West Indian vocalists Rayvon and Rikrok sang on this .
Shaggy helped them put together solo albums in return .
The bass line is sampled from `` The Joker '' by Steve Miller .
It was one of the first times Steve Miller allowed one of his songs to be sampled .
He let Run-D.M.C. use `` Take The Money And Run '' with Everlast on vocals at around the same time .
In 1990 , Miller won a lawsuit against rap group The Geto Boys when they used `` The Joker '' without his permission .
The album sold 5.5 million copies in 2001 , more than any other .
