This Balearic Disco chiller is sung by West Coast soft-rock songwriter Paul Williams -LRB- David Bowie , the Carpenters , the Muppets -RRB- .
His lyrics are about the existential world beyond oceans and mountains .
`` It is a cosmic super song with very poetic lyrics and very pure , '' Daft Punk told French publication Le Nouvel Observateur .
We talked a lot with Paul Williams of the direction of this album , and it was worth it to put words to our ideas . ''
