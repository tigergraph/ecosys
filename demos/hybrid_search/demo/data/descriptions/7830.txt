This was the first song to be released by Canadian R&B / Soul singer/songwriter Melanie Fiona from her debut album , The Bridge .
It was a Top 20 hit in Canada and several European countries .
The song heavily samples the 1968 hit `` Time of the Season '' by The Zombies .
Fiona explained why she chose to borrow from this tune to Killahbeez : `` I was already a fan of that song from time !
It 's a classic !
When we started working on the music for the album , we knew we wanted to pay tribute to the `` old '' by putting a ` new ' spin on it .
That sample is familiar and easy to vibe with ... it was the perfect fit for the lyrics . ''
The song has a message of empowerment for women .
Fiona told Killahbeez : `` I feel so strong every time I sing or perform that song . ''
She added : `` It was written by a super talented songwriter and producer on the album , Andrea Martin .
She knows me very well , professionally and personally , it 's a real reflection of the type of woman I am .
I feel like there should be no shame in expressing what you want , and not settling for the things you do n't .
I feel proud to know that it will empower people ... not just women , but everyone who feels the same . ''
