This traditional American Gospel song is based on Jesus Christ 's admonition for total dedication from his followers in Luke 9:62 .
The verse reads : `` No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God . ''
Bob Dylan recorded the song for his eponymous debut album , cutting it in a single take .
According to Dominick Cavallo 's A Fiction of the Past : The Sixties in American History , when recording the LP , Dylan turned down requests to do second takes .
`` I said no .
I ca n't see myself singing the same song twice in a row .
That 's terrible . ''
