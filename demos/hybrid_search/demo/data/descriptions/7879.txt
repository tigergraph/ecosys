This is the second single from California alternative rock band Say Anything 's self-titled fourth album .
Frontman Max Bemis -LRB- from Alternative Press -RRB- : `` This is a song I wrote later on in the writing process .
It 's about the recognition that we live in a flawed society .
I wrote the lyrics first .
They were a criticism about myself and , like , this really negative song .
What I realized when I finally finished the lyrics is that I had overcome a lot of the things that I was making fun of about myself , and that to write a song about those things would be a novelty or sort of typical Say Anything act - to make a negative , self-deprecating song .
So my goal was to write a positive , uplifting song , but still have it be very `` Say Anything . ''
It 's about the ability every human being has to fulfill his or her potential .
It does n't mean we can all be godlike , but we can do better than how we tend to do .
Once you realize that , you have a lot more options open to you as a human being . ''
