This song finds Ciara cooing come-ons to her partner over Soundz 's seductive synthy soundscape .
Soundz previously worked with the songstress on her 2010 album , Basic Instinct , including the single `` Gim me Dat . ''
He also co-produced another Ciara track , `` DUI , '' with The Rockstarz .
The song title is only sung once by Ciara right at the end .
` Sophomore ' is a synonym for `` second , '' but in this instance it is used as a play on words on ` soft and more ' meaning the singer 's soft body leaves her lover wanting more .
The song was originally leaked by DJ Orator in September 2012 .
