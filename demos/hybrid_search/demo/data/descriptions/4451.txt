`` Vitamin R '' stands for Ritalin , a drug often given to children to calm them down .
-LRB- thanks , Jared - Shoemakersville , PA -RRB- This was inspired by a friend of the Loeffler brothers who was misdiagnosed with ADHD , and developed an addiction to Ritalin .
As a result , he would often do crazy and odd things , such as drive around aimlessly for hours , determined to hear a specific song on the radio .
