Kingston told Blues and Soul magazine about this song , regarding the hardship of watching his mother and sister being sent to prison when he was just 15 years old : `` I always had my brother .
But , when my mother and sister went away , it took a lot out of me : My sister went away for four months , while my mom has been away for over two years now -LRB- allegedly for either tax evasion or identity fraud -RRB- .
But , while I missed her like crazy , I actually used that as my motivation for writing that song .
I 'm basically telling her ` We 've been through a lotta stuff and the struggle 's been crazy .
But do n't cry - everything 's gon na be cool . '
While in the verses I 'm also explaining to other people how the whole situation put me under pressure .
You know , while most people around 14/15 have their mom around them , go to school and live a normal life , I was homeless doing lawnmower services - cutting grass and doing whatever I had to do to get money . ''
