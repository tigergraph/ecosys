This sexed-up rocker finds Mars referencing drugs , alcohol , and the pleasures of the flesh in true rock 'n' roll fashion as well as some cussing .
`` It 's about good old animalistic sex , '' Mars told Rolling Stone .
So why the gorilla on the Unorthodox Jukebox album cover ?
Mars explained to MTV News that the primate is there because , `` that was the first song we wrote for this album and it really set the tone for the entire project and it kind of became the mascot .
Why not put it on the cover ? ''
Mars was arrested in 2010 for possession of cocaine , and Rolling Stone asked the singer whether he was concerned the lyric `` Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker '' might remind listeners of the drug bust .
Mars did n't seem concerned .
`` To take that line out would dilute my art , '' he replied .
`` The song needs a sense of danger .
When I was a kid , pop could be dangerous but still massive .
Michael Jackson would grab his crotch .
Prince would rock assless chaps .
With this album , I wan na let loose . ''
The song 's steamy music video was co-directed by Bruno Mars and his frequent collaborator Cameron Duddy .
It finds the singer and his band performing the song in a seedy south-of-the-border strip club .
The opening sequence features a cameo appearance by Puerto Rican American actor Luis Guzman -LRB- Boogie Nights , Traffic -RRB- as the club 's sleazy owner and the clip also co-stars Slumdog Millionaire actress Freida Pinto as Isabella the stripper .
