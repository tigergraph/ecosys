This is the fastest DragonForce track to date .
Speaking in an interview on Roadrunner Records ' website , the band 's guitarist and songwriter Sam Totman said that before he sets out to write any songs , the first thing he decides in his head is the tempo .
He said : `` With ` Fallen World , ' I was like , let 's do a song at 220 bpm .
Most of our fast songs are usually 200 , so that was the first thing I thought of , was let 's do one at 220 .
We had one other song , a bonus track on Sonic Firestorm called ` Cry of the Brave , ' that was 215 .
So it was n't so much like , let 's be faster than ever before , because I could have done it at 250 , but our music does n't work that way .
You 've got bands like Slayer who are up at like 230 , but I 've tried writing songs at that speed and it does n't really work , for some reason , with the vocal melodies and stuff , but 220 seemed to work quite well .
But there was definitely a plan behind it , because it just gives it a bit of a different feel .
It 's not hugely different , it 's only about 20 beats per minute faster , but it 's different from the rest of the fast songs . ''
