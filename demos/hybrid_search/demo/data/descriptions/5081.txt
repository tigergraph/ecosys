This song was penned by the Country singer-songwriter Katrina Elam -LRB- the Rascal Flatts ' collaboration with Natasha Bedingfield , `` Easy '' -RRB- , Nashville songsmith Melissa Pierce -LRB- David Nail 's `` Red Light '' -RRB- and John Paul White , who is one half of the folk duo The Civil Wars .
Frontman Mike Eli admitted to The Boot that the song differs from their usual material .
`` For me as a singer , it 's incredible fun to sing , '' he said .
`` The song is something we have n't done before lyrically , and it gives us the opportunity to do something a little different . ''
The song touches on matters of the heart , a topic the band are not comfortable writing about together .
`` It 's kind of a sappy love song , which is tough for the four of us to sit down and write , '' Jones told CBS Local .
`` To hear it done really well compelled us to give it a shot .
It was a different kind of song for us that we had never really attempted before . ''
`` We 're songwriters and we love to write songs , '' added Eli , `` but a great song is a great song .
We heard one of -LSB- White 's -RSB- versions that he had recorded and just loved it . ''
The song 's music video features a robot , and we believe it to be the first science-fiction promo by a Country artist .
Bass guitarist Jon Jones told The Boot : `` When we saw the first line of the treatment , and saw that it said a robot does this , we were like ` What ? '
But by the end of the script , we were like , ` This is OK .
I get it . '
The way it was shot , which makes the robot come to life , is very cool . ''
