K'Jon got his first major song placement in 2004 on the 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack .
He hoped that would open some doors but nothing happen .
Four years on K'Jon found himself frustrated with his singing career , which was when this song came to him .
`` I was sitting in the middle of nowhere , in L.A. , writing for other artists , away from my newborn child and the song just hit me , '' he recalled to Billboard magazine .
`` I felt like I was on a deserted island and I could see my rescue ship , but I could n't get on it .
` On the Ocean ' became a metaphor for what I was waiting on . ''
Asked of his opinion on why this song received such a positive response , K'Jon said in his press biography : `` I think the song relates to so many people who are hoping for a better situation in life .
That ` ship coming in ' as referred to in the song has many meanings .
It 's about never giving up ! ''
