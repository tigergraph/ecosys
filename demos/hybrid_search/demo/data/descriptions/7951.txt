Ciara explained this song to MTV News : `` Basically , I say , ` If that boy do n't love you by now , he 'll never ever love you . '
And sometimes we wait around and we go through so many different things .
And if that person is not showing you the affection you need and not giving you the right love , then you got to let it go .
I talk about the confusion of love - being confused about staying or leaving or letting go . ''
Producer Polow da Don told MTV News : `` Hard midtempo is back .
Where dudes can ride around in their cars and listen to R&B and not feel like a girl .
-LSB- ` Never Ever ' -RSB- is hard like a rap record , and that 's why Jeezy had no problem jumping on it - 'cause it 's hard . ''
Ciara told MTV News that the song 's video is , like the record , about confusion .
She added that the song , `` is talking about the confusion of love and that 's just the little story -LSB- within the video -RSB- : We tell the many angles of love ... or of the love confusion . ''
This song features the rapper Young Jeezy as a male counterpoint .
According to Ciara on her MySpace blog , he was there to `` Represent for the Fellas . ''
The song 's chorus samples Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes ' 1971 hit , `` If You Do n't Know Me By Now , '' which was later successfully covered by Simply Red .
