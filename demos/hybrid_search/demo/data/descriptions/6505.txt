This song harks back to vocalist Bradford Cox 's confused teenage years , when he was searching for identity , be it punk or simply trying to `` find some release . ''
Cox penned the tune at a friend 's house in New York .
He 'd temporarily gone north from his hometown of Atlanta to get away from some personal difficulties .
Cox ended up playing bass on the track , but he told Billboard magazine this was n't because of the departure of Deerhunter 's long-time bassist Josh Fauver .
`` I played a lot of stuff on that song , but that 's only because the demo is so confusing because I was drunk when I made it , '' he said .
`` I was in character for that song . ''
La Vie Antérieure is French for a past life , ` Vie ' meaning ` life ' and ` Antérieure ' meaning ` prior to ' or ` previous to . '
