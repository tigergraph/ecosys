Guitarist Benji Madden described this to Spin magazine as `` a classic Good Charlotte song . ''
He added : `` It 's one of my favorite songs on the record .
It 's a metaphor for where our country is with the recession and the economy .
We look back to the depression and its recovery .
We 're telling people , ` Hey , the storm 's almost over . ' ''
Benji told Alternative Press : `` This song is written about true love - a love each member of the band has with someone or something .
It 's about how the ups and downs show the strength of love .
The dream is to make it last forever . ''
