It was released on Norwegian radio on April 24 , 2009 , having only been completed the night before .

Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman is credited as one of the photographers in Foot of the Mountain 's booklet .
Berryman took the picture of the mountain that the front cover is based on , whilst on a trek across the Norwegian national park with Furuholmen .
The song is based upon the track `` The Longest Night '' by a-ha guitarist/keyboardist Magne Furuholmen , which was released on his 2008 solo album A Dot of Black In The Blue Of Your Bliss .
The song 's music video was filmed in two German locations , the city of Berlin and on the Baltic Sea coast of Western Pomerania .
Guitarist and principal songwriter Paul Waaktaar-Savoy explained in publicity materials that that the song is about the buzz of New York City versus the beauty and isolation of Norway .
He said : `` It 's the dilemma of loving a city life , yet secretly wondering if we 'd be happier being surrounded by open fields and sweeping mountains . ''
