Edens Edge guitarist Dean Berner wrote this song with Nashville songwriters Laura Veltz and Vince Melamed .
The same trio also penned the track `` Cherry Pie '' for the band 's eponymous debut album .
Edens Edge started playing this cheeky song during the 2011 fall Reba McEntire tour , and from the crowd reaction the trio knew they had to include it on their debut album .
Said Berner : `` We always say if you 're from the country , you 've probably done this -LRB- whether you want to admit it or not -RRB- , but if you 're not , I bet you 'll want to after you hear the song . ''
