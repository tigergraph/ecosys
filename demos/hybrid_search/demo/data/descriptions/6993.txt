This flamenco-tinged track was inspired by Spanish guitarist Vicente Amigo .
It also incorporates a salsa section .
Baxter told the Daily Mail March 21 , 2008 : `` The Latin piano came from a rehearsal .
It just worked . ''
After being dropped by Sony , Baxter released Skybound on his own label , Sylvian .
A gifted painter , Baxter partly funded its release by painting a canvas illustrating each one of the ten songs on the album .
The paintings , later used for sleeve artwork , were sold for # 2,000 apiece .
Baxter explained to the Daily Mail : `` It was a great way of getting a record out .
I had wanted to do something similar with my first album , but it would n't have worked so well on a big label .
I also liked the notion of getting back to the vinyl era .
With singers like David Bowie , the artwork was as important as the music .
It kept things fresh for me .
I did n't want to be seen as just another singer-songwriter .
I was surprised at how much money I raised from the canvases , but I put a high price on them because I hoped that people would be ready to invest in a piece of original album artwork . ''
