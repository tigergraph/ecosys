This brooding , menacing rocker was written during a thunderstorm by Babyshambles frontman Peter Doherty , guitarist Mik Whitnall , bassist Drew McConnell and former vocalist of the English Blues/Rock band The Bandits , John Robinson .
Doherty told NME : `` We wrote this in the Pyrenees , where I was convalescing with the parents of a ballerina .
Drew found me and turned up with Mik and John and we wrote it in the granny house at the bottom of the garden .
A house of happiness it was . ''
Drew McConnell added : `` We actually wrote it in real time .
We were in a shed drinking French wine , there was a big huge storm outside and we just started freestyling the lyrics -- one line each . ''
