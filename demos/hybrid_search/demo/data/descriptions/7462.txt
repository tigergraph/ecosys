This is the opening track from Plastic Beach , the third studio album by the virtual band Gorillaz .
The band is a creation of Blur frontman Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett , co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl .
Gorillaz is composed of four animated band members : lead vocalist and keyboardist 2D , bass guitarist Murdoc Niccals , lead guitarist Noodle and drummer Russel Hobbs .
Murdoc added : `` This little symphony was recorded with the Sinfonia Viva orchestra , in Derby , around April 2009 .
I recorded with them in the old Rolls Royce engine factory , where they built the engines for the World War II spitfires .
Which fits the soul of all this - a bygone era , the remnants of war and planes and decay . ''
Murdoc discussed this orchestral piece on the Gorillaz website : `` I needed something other-worldly to open the record .
This album 's been a while in the making and this needed to be The Big Reveal .
It needed to be portentous , vast and ... oceanic .
But graceful .
Like the morphine 's just gently kicking in as the listener glides into the Plastic Bay .
Mmmm . ''
