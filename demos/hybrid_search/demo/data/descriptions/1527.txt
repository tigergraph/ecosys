This free download single was made available prior to the release of the Welsh rock band Funeral for a Friend 's fifth studio album , Welcome Home Armageddon .
The song sees drummer Ryan Richards take lead vocals , about which he told CMU : `` It was a lot of fun for me to do a lead vocal again on a track , as it 's probably something I 've not done since way back on the first record - and even then it was a co-vocal with -LSB- frontman -RSB- Matt -LSB- Davies-Kreye -RSB- on tracks like ` Red Is The New Black ' and ` This Year 's Most Open Heartbreak . ' ''
Richards contributes finger snaps to the track , about which he told CMU : `` It 's also the first track I 've ever done finger snaps on too !
I remember reading the liner notes to Michael Jackson 's Bad and seeing him credited with ` Vocals and Finger Snaps ' and it inspired me to one day be credited as such on one of our albums .
I 've now dreamed the dream - and it 's a beautiful thing . ''
