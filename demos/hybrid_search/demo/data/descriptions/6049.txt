Orton told Jam !
Music that the blueprint for the production of Sugaring Season was Roberta Flack 's debut album First Take , which includes her classic hit tune , `` First Time I Ever Saw Your Face . ''
She explained to Jam !
Music : `` I was obsessed with making an album based loosely on the sound of that record and the feel of that record .
It 's kind of a classic sound , sort of a timeless thing .
There 's no irony .
It 's just fully honest , fully realized , in the moment .
`` This song features Beth Orton 's live vocal on top of a rehearsal take - her band did n't know she was taping .
