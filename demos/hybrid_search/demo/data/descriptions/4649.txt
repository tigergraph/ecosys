This is the second single released by the British singer-songwriter Clare Maguire .
It was premiered on Huw Stephen 's BBC Radio 1 show on January 3 , 2011 the day it was announced that Maguire had come in 5th place on the BBC Sound of 2011 list of the year 's most promising new artists .
Maguire discussed her song writing process in an interview with CMU : `` It happens differently all the time , but usually I will feel something very strongly and then almost make stories with visions in my head , and the words just flow out ; though I usually hear the music first . ''
Maguire wrote the song a day after the death of her childhood hero , Michael Jackson .
She penned the tune in response to the misplaced comments some people were making about the musical legend following his passing .
She explained to Artist Direct : `` I wrote ` The Last Dance ' just after Michael Jackson passed away .
I was really angry with the hate people were spreading about him on the internet .
I thought it was really wrong because he spread so much happiness with his music .
Two days later , I went in the studio , sat at the piano and wrote the song in about 15 minutes .
I withdrew my anger and sadness from that .
Then , there were other things in my life happening at the time that came into the song .
It 's one of my favourites . ''
