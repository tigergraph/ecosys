This piano-led ballad was an instrumental backing track languishing in the Rolling Stones ' archives , but was pulled from the band 's vault and re-recorded with an entirely new lyric for release on the 2010 update of their 1972 album , Exile on Main St. .
Jagger said to The Sunday Times May 9 , 2010 of the Nicky Hopkins original piano-led track : `` I 've always liked it , but I never quite knew what was going to happen to it .
`` In another interview , Jagger added : '' `` It 's a good feeling when it all comes together .
There 's a track called ` Following the River , ' which is a ballad .
It 's a got beautiful piano on it , which I did n't play .
And I 'd heard this before but it did n't have any lyrics at all .
I could hear different melodies but I did n't know how I was going to get the melody to fit with this already existing track , which is very heavily piano .
And when it came together , I was just singing onto it , I was putting it on the stereo and I was singing along , trying out different melody lines and trying out different words .
And when it actually came together , it 's a very good moment , you know ?
There 's a moment - there 's a frustration , there 's a build-up of this -LSB- makes discouraged face -RSB- , and then try , try , try , try , and there 's a moment when it really comes together for you . ''
