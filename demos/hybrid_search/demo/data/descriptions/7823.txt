Toby Keith penned this light-hearted rocker about two buddies with the Nashville songwriter Rivers Rutherford .
He explained that the song 's title was something his father used to say .
`` I always thought it was funny , '' he said .
`` See a pretty girl and go , ` Look out , boys .
That 's the size I wear right there . '
It 's like when me and Scotty -LRB- Emerick -RRB- wrote ` As Good As I Once Was . '
That 's something my dad used to say , too .
He also used to say , ' I do n't know what I 'd do if your mama ever left me ... guess I 'd just go with her . '
Me , Scotty and Dean Dillon wrote that one -LRB- `` Go With Her . '' -RRB-
`` Stuff like that is very intriguing to me and I had it laying around , '' he continued .
`` Rivers took off on it and we decided it was about a couple buddies drinking .
I had the ` Five-foot-two , 95 pounds .
Round in the places she 's supposed to be round ' and Rivers just flipped over it when I told him the idea .
There was another little piece that did n't work , but Rivers fixed the chorus and then we wrote the verses .
It 's just comical . ''
