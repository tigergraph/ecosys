Bob Dylan wrote this following his split from Suze Rotolo , who he dated between 1961 and 1964 .
The song details what was the pair 's initial courting : `` I once loved a girl , her skin it was bronze/With the innocence of a lamb , she was gentle like a fawn/I courted her proudly , but now she is gone/Gone as the season she 's taken . ''
Dylan goes on to admit he was a poor partner to Rotolo , who he once cheated on with folk singer , Joan Baez : `` Myself , for what I did , I can not be excused/The changes I was going through ca n't even be used/For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose/The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime . ''
Dylan criticizes Rotolo 's sister , Carla : `` For her parasite sister , I had no respect/Bound by her boredom , her pride to protect/Countless visions of the other she 'd reflect/As a crutch for her scenes and her society . ''
Bob and Carla had a very difficult relationship .
The song details a violent fight which took place between them in March 1964 , on the night Bob and Suze finally split up : `` Beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound/Her sister and I in a screaming battleground/And she in between , the victim of sound/Soon shattered as a child ` neath her shadows . ''
Dylan concludes the song reminiscing about Suze : `` The wind knocks my window , the room it is wet/The words to say I 'm sorry , I have n't found yet/I think of her often and hope whoever she 's met/Will be fully aware of how precious she is . ''
Suze Rotolo forgave Dylan for this seething attack on her sister .
Rotolo told Victoria Balfour : `` People have asked how I felt about those songs that were bitter , like ` Ballad in Plain D , ' since I inspired some of those too ; yet I never felt hurt by them .
I understood what he was doing .
It was the end of something and we both were hurt and bitter .
His art was his outlet , his exorcism .
It was healthy .
That was the way he wrote out his life , the loving songs , the cynical songs , the political songs , they are all part of the way he saw his world and lived his life , period . ''
Dylan regrets writing this song .
He told Bill Flanagan in 1985 : `` Oh yeah , that one !
I look back and say ' I must have been a real schmuck to write that . '
I look back at that particular one and say , of all the songs I 've written , maybe I could have left that alone . ''
Dylan added : `` I would n't really exploit a relationship with somebody .
Whereas in ` Ballad in Plain D' I did .
Not knowing that I did it .
At that time my audience was very small .
It overtook my mind so I wrote it .
Maybe I should n't have used that . ''
Another Side of Bob Dylan was Dylan 's fourth album .
Dylan deviated from politically-charged lyrics to instead write on more personal issues for this album - a move which prompted backlash from fans who claimed he had lost touch with his audience .
