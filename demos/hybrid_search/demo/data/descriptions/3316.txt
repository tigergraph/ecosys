Here 's another link between the song 's performer and its songwriters : Cruz wrote Jennifer Lopez 's 2011 single `` I 'm Into You , '' whilst Hajji , AJ Junior , RedOne and Jimmy Joker penned together Lopez 's follow-up release , `` Papi . ''
The song features vocals from Cuban-American rapper Pitbull , and was penned by the duo along with Bilal Hajji , and AJ Junior .
Frequent Lady Gaga collaborator RedOne and Jimmy Joker produced the track .
Cruz told Digital Spy about working with the energetic RedOne .
`` He 's one of those producers that brings people together because he has such a positive energy about him , '' he said .
`` He 's always jumping around and singing crazy hook lines in the studio .
He also speaks five languages and is always pulling references from loads of different places .
He 's a family man as well , so his son was often hanging around the studio . ''
