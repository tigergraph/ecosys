British singer Maverick Sabre 's first single from his self-titled debut album is hard to place in any specific genre .
He told Female First in an interview : `` All my music is a mix of everything I 've listened to over time .
Some people listen to it and say that 's a soul track , it 's got a hip-hop influence , a bit of blues .
Really , all I want my music to be everything I 've been influenced by , and my own stamp on that .
I do n't really know what label to put on it .
If I had to say something it would be hip-hop inspired soulful folk music .
` Let Me Go ' is just another little branch of that . ''
The song was released on July 22 , 2011 as a digital download in the United Kingdom .
The video was shot on location in Las Vegas and directed by Luke & Barber .
The song samples the female vocal refrain in the chorus of `` Glory Box '' by Portishead , which itself borrows from Isaac Hayes ' 1971 song `` Ike 's Rap II . ''
Lyrically , the song deals with addiction .
Sabre explained the its meaning to The Sun : `` I had a problem with Jack Daniel 's .
Everyone has their demons .
That 's why people can relate to that song , whether it be drugs , a relationship , gambling , alcohol , sex , whatever.For me Jack Daniel 's is my evil .
It 's such a universal song and I 've had people thanking me for helping them overcome their problems through that song .
How proud am I to hear that . ''
