This song is about how people get foolishly caught up in the world of Punk Rock .
The song tells a story about a rocker and his girlfriend , and their self-destructive lifestyles .
The line , `` The story never changes , just the names and faces '' implies that we all need to wake up before we end up like the people in the song .
-LRB- thanks , Blake - Chico , CA -RRB- A modified version of this song was a big hit on Radio Disney , as were several Bowling for Soup songs .
The Disney connection helped get the band the gig performing the Phineas and Ferb theme song .
So how does this Disney success effect the band ?
Lead singer Jaret Reddick told us : `` Bowling for Soup is its own thing .
When ` Punk Rock 101 ' and ' 1985 ' were on Radio Disney , we were in their top 3 for the better part of about three years .
Our audience did get young , but we pretty much stayed true to who we were .
Going from being a bar band to a band that 's got a hit and on Radio Disney , the audience got a little bit younger , and our live show changed a little bit in that it was n't rated R or NC17 anymore .
Our big thing is , look , we can do PG13 .
And if it 's a fair or something like that , we can do PG .
But it 's impossible for Bowling for Soup to do a G-rated show , because lyrically you just ca n't get around it .
We 've only done one G-rated show ever , and it was for Radio Disney 's tenth anniversary .
And I had to sing all of the edited lyrics .
That was a great challenge for me , trying to sing the songs the way they do n't go . ''
