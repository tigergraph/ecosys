The title track of American indie rock band Yeah Yeah Yeahs fourth album finds Karen O singing about those pesky blood-sucking insects .
She told NME : `` I basically wanted to write songs about things that I felt strongly about and mosquitoes turned out to be one of those things - I have a strong dislike for mosquitoes .
I 'm surprised there are n't more songs about mosquitoes actually . ''
Fun Fact : Did you know that mosquitoes are particularly attracted to people that have recently eaten bananas ?
The Shimbe Shim-directed video takes a rather literal interpretation of the track whereby a mosquito lands on a little boy 's hand and starts sucking his blood , changing color with each gulp .
The album cover was created by Korean-born , San Diego-based illustrator and animator Beomsik Shimbe Shim .
He told NME : `` I imagined a giant , hairy , female mosquito dragging up a helpless boy into the night sky .
It could be happening onstage while Karen O is singing - or even in your room at night . ''
He added : `` Karen really wanted the mosquito to be a sexy and beautifully gross female .
In the end I considered the mosquito as Karen O herself - the warrior-like female rock star . ''
Karen O told UK newspaper The Sun the band thought ` Mosquito ' was a great album title , `` as they 've been around since prehistoric times and are n't going anywhere . ''
