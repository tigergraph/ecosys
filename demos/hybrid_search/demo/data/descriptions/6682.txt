This was released as the first single from the American Psychedelic Pop band Yeasayer 's third album , Fragrant World .
Guitarist/keyboardist Anand Wilder told Complex magazine : `` This was a single that we were all really excited about as being a new direction for the band .
There 's a great sounding sub-bass in it , and a pretty good melody that goes back and forth .
A lot of good drops . ''
Multi-instrumentalist Kishi Bashi played strings on this track .
He has toured internationally as a violinist with such acts as Regina Spektor and Of Montreal .
Several of the Fragrant World tracks combine upbeat instrumentation with dark lyrical content , but on this song the band switches things round .
Guitarist/keyboardist Anand Wilder told Complex magazine : '' ` Longevity ' is super slow and sludgy , but it 's actually a song about relationships and having good memories about some .
I think conversely maybe some of the uptempo songs have darker context .
I think it comes from searching for new ways to make sounds . ''
