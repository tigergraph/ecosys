This song is based around Dead Or Alive 's 1985 UK # 1 `` You Spin Me Round -LRB- Like a Record -RRB- . ''
In this song 's debut week in February 2009 , this was downloaded 636,000 times , thereby breaking the record already held by Flo Rida , in January 2008 when `` Low '' was purchased 467,000 times .
It also broke the record for most downloads in a debut week , which had been set by Eminem 's , Dr. Dre and 50 Cent 's `` Crack a Bottle , '' which was purchased 418,000 times in its first seven days .
Flo Rida told Billboard magazine about the Dead or Alive sample : `` I always listened to those kinds of records growing up .
But , it was actually my A&R from Atlantic that brought the beat to my attention .
So , we went in the studio , Dr. Luke did the sample and made the production , and I recorded it . ''
Some have interpreted this song as Flo Rida saying that he 's upset that the woman is taking so much of his money .
He clarified the lyric to djbooth.net : `` You know , in this record , it 's not really sayin ' that I do n't want 'em to take my money ; it 's the fact that I 'm enjoying myself , and just really gettin ' the female 's attention , like , ` Hey , when I 'm havin ' a nice time in the club , you just might watch me make it rain .
You might get some of my money . '
So I 'm not really sayin ' I do n't want 'em to take my money , it 's really that I 've come to enjoy myself . ''
One of the credited co-writers was Bruno Mars , two years before he found fame with his own chart-topping singles `` Just The Way You Are '' and `` Grenade . ''
The tune features Ke $ ha , whose song `` Chain Reaction '' was featured in the MTV reality show The Hills .
The singer/actress also can be seen in Katy Perry 's `` I Kissed a Girl '' video .
Later in 2009 , she picked up steam as a solo artist with her single `` Tik Tok . ''
Flo Rida explained to MTV News that the song , `` is about a young lady , she might be in the strip club and she 's got my head spinning round .
Or any young lady that I might see walking past me that 's getting my attention .
She got it going on !
I 'm going crazy over her .
I might go to the club and make it rain ... in the club on her because she got it going on . ''
On this song , Flo Rida raps about pole dancers .
Digital Spy asked him if he was `` a connoisseur when it comes to that sort of thing ? ''
Flo Rida replied : `` Oh yeah !
You 're not wrong .
With my ` Low ' record and all my success last year , going to strip clubs was my staple .
Now with my new record I 'm sure it 's going to be just the same !
When I go to a strip club and my music is being played , it feels great to know everyone 's getting off on it . ''
Ke $ ha was asked to appear in the video , but declined .
In an interview with Esquire magazine , she said , `` They -LSB- Flo Rida 's team -RSB- wanted me in the video , and I said , ` Nah , I want to make my own name for myself . ' ''
