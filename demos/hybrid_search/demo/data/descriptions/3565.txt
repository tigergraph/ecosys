This song is a duet with Luciano Pavarotti singing in Italian and Zucchero singing English lyrics written by U2 's Bono .
Zucchero composed `` Miserere '' with Pavarotti in mind .
The success of this song led to the longrunning Pavarotti and Friends concert series , in which Zucchero was a regular guest .
Pavarotti was reluctant to record without first hearing a demo .
During auditions for a demo to send to the Italian tenor Zucchero , he came across a blind lawyer who worked as a piano player in a bar in Pisa .
The pianist was a then unknown Andrea Bocelli , who agreed to make a demo with Zucchero .
After hearing the demo recording , Pavarotti at first urged Zucchero to use Bocelli instead of himself , but then agreed he would accompany Zucchero .
Andrea Bocelli later turned into one of the best selling Opera and Pop singers in the world .
Michael Kamen was in charge of the orchestra on this .
