This song tells the story of a woman ending her relationship with a gentleman , who dated her , after catching him cheating on her with another girl .
The woman tells the gentleman to go get another dumb blonde because he was n't going to be with her anymore .
-LRB- thanks , Margaret - Worcester , MA -RRB- This was used in the 2000 movie Snow Day , which gave the song a great deal of exposure .
The music video had a snow theme to coincide with the film .
