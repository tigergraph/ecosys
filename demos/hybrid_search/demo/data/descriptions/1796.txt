This is a single from Canadian metal punks , Cancer Bats , fourth full length album , Dead Set On Living .
Frontman Liam Cormier told Terrorizer magazine how an online hater influenced the cut .
`` This is the first song that I actually wrote , lyrically , for the record , '' he explained .
`` I think it went up somewhere on the internet , but there was some thing like ` Cancer Bats are starting to work on a new album ' and all these kids were like ` aw , this is the best , ' writing comments like ` fu -- ing ca n't wait !
, ' ` so stoked ' and then somebody wrote like ` f -- k this band , when are these guys gon na stop making music ' and I looked at it and was like , ` oh you do n't want us to make any more music ?
Well guess what mother fu -- er , I 'm gon na make music forever , just to piss you off .
Like f -- k you ! '
Like , how is me being in a band really affecting your life , where just like this is the worst , the fact that we 're putting out a new record .
So I kinda thought of this funny response to all s -- t talkers , you know like in all thrash songs they 'll have this funny kind of aspect to it , this is like my vibe .
So any of those s -- t talkers , it was the idea of a pack of ogres going into to their bedrooms and smashing their computers and eating them alive .
That was my mentality for the song , so a fun song about that . ''
