American Indie Rock band Grouplove formed in 2009 following a chance meeting at a Cretan artists ' retreat .
This song was penned by vocalist Christian Zucconi and keyboardist Hannah Hooper .
Zucconi told the story of the song to ILikeMusic : '' That came from my past .
When I got back from Greece and my band I was playing with kind of fell apart , Hannah and I started playing that song acoustically .
When we brought it to the studio we were just throwing out ideas and rhymes , and Colours came up and they heard it and were like ` what 's that !? ' Then we just started playing this awesome drum beat to it , and the way it used to be to where it 's come to now is like a whole new breath of fresh air .
The speed is better ... it 's slower and it 's got harmonies on it . ''
The song features on the soundtrack for the video games Madden NFL 12 and FIFA 12 .
