Ohio-born and raised singer-songwriter Joshua Radin turned to music when he moved to New York City and bought a guitar .
This was the first song he wrote .
He recalled to American Songwriter magazine : `` I was walking through the East Village where I was living and I kept thinking ' I should know who I am by now . '
And that became the first line of my first song .
It came out of frustration . ''
The song has gone on to touch many people .
Radin told American Songwriter magazine : '' ` Winter ' is a song that I hear people really have been moved by .
A lot of people play that song at funerals , so I know it 's an emotional response people are having . ''
In 2004 , the American actor Zach Braff introduced this song to Scrubs ' creator , Bill Lawrence , who included it in the `` My Screw Up '' episode .
He ultimately used several of Radin 's songs in various scenes of the hit television series .
