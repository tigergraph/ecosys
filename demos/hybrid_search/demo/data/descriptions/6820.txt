On August 20 , 2010 , Charles Haddon , the frontman of north London band Ou Est Le Swimming Pool , killed himself after performing at Pukkelpop festival in Belgium .
The singer feared he had seriously injured a young girl in a stage dive and distraught , he jumped from a telecommunications mast in the backstage artists ' parking area .
Haddon was a childhood friend of Tribes singer Johnny Lloyd and this song was inspired by his pal 's tragic death .
Lloyd told The Sun : '' ` Nightdriving ' was weird to write - I was in my living room demoing that song when I got the phone call that Charlie had died .
I left the vocals off for weeks and weeks .
Then I did it .
I went out for a drive that night and thought it would be a nice title . ''
