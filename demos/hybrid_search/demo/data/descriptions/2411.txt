Martina performs this cut with a sensual swagger .
The singer penned the song with Leslie Satcher and Rachel Thibodeaux , and she told Billboard magazine : `` Leslie had the idea for the song .
She said , ' I want you to do something sexy and different .
She played a little bit of the idea , and I just loved it .
It is different for me , but it also feels very comfortable and natural . ''
