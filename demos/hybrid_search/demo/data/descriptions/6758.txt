This was the theme song to the movie The Legend of Billie Jean , which was a box office bomb despite the success of this song .
The 1985 film starred two unrelated Slaters : Helen and Christian .
Simon Climie and Holly Knight wrote this empowerment anthem .
Climie 's songwriting credits include `` I Knew You Were Waiting -LRB- For Me -RRB- '' by George Michael and Aretha Franklin , and `` Ecstasy '' by Jeff Beck .
Knight wrote Benatar 's 1983 hit `` Love Is A Battlefield . ''
In our interview with Holly Knight , she says of `` Invincible '' : `` I love that song .
It 's one of my favorite songs .
I 'd love to hear that song cut by an alternative band , like Foo Fighters or something . ''
