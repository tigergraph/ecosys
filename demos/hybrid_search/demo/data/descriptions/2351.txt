This quirky party song was penned by Chris Tompkins , Mark Irwin and Joe Collins .
`` I just put the vocals on it ; it 's gon na be awesome , '' Brice told The Boot with a big smile .
`` It 's called ` Beer . '
-LSB- laughs -RSB- It 's a guy song .
I 've got so much love stuff out , and that 's a part of me .
But I 'm also a fun , rowdy fella .
` Beer ' is different - it 's country , it 's rock 'n roll and it 's everything that I am ! ''
Brice explained why he wanted to cut this for his sophomore album : `` It starts out as a good feeling country song , all laid back and easy going like Billy Currington , and then it goes into heavy rock .
My band is really a rock 'n' roll band at heart , and they play my music with a passion .
` Beer ' just has that going on , and I thought , `` What redneck country listener is n't going to want to scream a song titled ` Beer ? ' ''
The simple images in the song are all true , and I wanted people to see that that part of me is still there . ''
