This song was inspired by Anthony J. Showalter and Elisha A. Hoffman 's 1887 hymn `` Leaning on the Everlasting Arms . ''
Showalter penned the classic spiritual tune after receiving letters from two of his former pupils saying that their wives had died .
As the former teacher wrote letters of consolation , he was inspired by the phrase in the Old Testament Book of Deuteronomy 33:27 - `` The eternal God is thy refuge , and underneath are the everlasting arms .
`` The hymn features prominently in the scores of the movies Night of the Hunter and the 2010 version of True Grit .
Vampire Weekend debuted the song live during their show at the Metro Theatre in Sydney on January 23 , 2013 .
Singer Ezra Koenig told NME : `` I 'd been obsessed with this 19th century American hymn ` Leaning on The Everlasting Arms ' , where they talk about how the stability the singer gets from their faith , but with our song there 's a darker riff on the same idea - someone who 's maybe in a bad place and yearning for that . ''
Ezra Koenig was brought up in a Jewish family , and this song refers to the eternal peace found in the embrace of a faith community .
`` There have been times I felt marginalized , being one of the only Jewish kids where I grew up , '' he told Spin magazine .
`` And there 've been times when I felt like part of something bigger , when I meet other Jewish people .
There are times when I feel alone in a crowd .
Those are struggles that I think everybody has .
It 's a beautiful idea , being part of a community .
But you lose some sense of your own ability to reason and your own individuality when you become part of a group .
Religion is a great jumping-off point for thinking about how to live , period . ''
