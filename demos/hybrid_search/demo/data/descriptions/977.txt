Until Scotty McCreery 's life turned upside down after winning the tenth season of American Idol , he 'd spent all his life in the North Carolina town of Garner .
He said that this Neil Thrasher , Casey Beathard and Tony Martin penned song speaks to him about `` staying grounded . ''
Explained Scotty : `` When I was younger , everybody said , ' I ca n't wait to get out of my hometown and go to college 500 miles away so I do n't have to see anybody again . '
It talks about getting back home and chatting with Mama and how you would do anything to get back home .
It 's a fun song about staying grounded and not forgetting where you came from , and no matter where you go , it all comes back around.I always loved my hometown , but of course , everybody grows up saying they ca n't wait to get out of there and go experience life outside of the little bubble they 've been in .
Now that I have been away for so long and seen what life is like out here , I ca n't wait to get back and see family and friends that I have missed for so long .
What I would give to take another English test in class !
Like the song says , I ca n't wait to get my feet back on the ground in Garner , N.C. ''
