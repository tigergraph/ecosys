Bassist JoJo Garza told Billboard magazine about this prayerful song : '' ` Forgiven ' is kind of like ` Heaven ' in that it 's about asking for help from the Lord through hard times .
But at the end of the darkness , there 's still a light .
That 's something Los Lonely Boys have always talked about . ''
The album was recorded on a soundstage , like a live show .
The San Antonio News July 4 , 2008 asked JoJo Garza why it was done that way .
The bassist replied : `` For one thing , the last two album we had done , we always felt , like , it was n't being captured , what we do live was n't being captured .
When we met Steve Jordan , he said , ' I know how to get this sound .
Because you guys have a swing that is n't coming out in your records .
I can see it and I can hear it live , and we 're gon na get that . ' ''
Steve Jordan produced the album .
Jordan 's CV includes producing and playing with John Mayer and tours with Keith Richards , The Blues Brothers and Eric Clapton .
