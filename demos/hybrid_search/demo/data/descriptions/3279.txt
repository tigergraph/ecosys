This mid-tempo '80s flavored synth-pop number is the first track Keane have ever recorded with songwriter/pianist Tim Rice-Oxley singing lead vocals .
The band 's usual singer , Tom Chaplin , told Consequence of Sound why he did n't record the vocals for this song : `` Had we gone into the studio intending to make a full album , I do n't think we would have given Tim the job of singing .
But because of the way we made this record , we just ran out of time to record my vocals for it .
The longer we lived with the demo vocal Tim had done for it , the more we liked it .
I really love that song and love the spirit in which it came about as well . ''
Chaplin told Consequence of Sound about the song : `` I think it 's a very sad and powerful song about that sense a lot of people get of clinging on to old romances .
It 's a sense of nostalgia or melancholy about the past . ''
