This racy number was titled `` Go-Kart '' when the Monkeys debuted it with three other new songs at a gig in New Zealand 's capital Wellington .
The original title came from its last line , `` Would you like me to build you a go-kart ? ''
According to The Sun newspaper , the song was inspired by frontman and songwriter Alex Turner 's beloved Mini car .
One Wellington audience member said : `` They played four new songs .
Everyone was rather surprised by one called GoKart .
A pal of Alex was saying it was inspired by the love of his life - his Mini , called Floyd . ''
