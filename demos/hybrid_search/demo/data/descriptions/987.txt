In an interview with The Boot the comment was made that American Ride shows a softer side to Keith .
He responded : `` As I get older , that stuff comes out more .
It started when I wrote -LRB- 2001 single -RRB- ` You Should n't Kiss Me Like This . '
That 's a three-and-a-half minute song about a five-second kiss .
If you want to talk about that five seconds as good as you can talk about it , it 's going to take three-and-a-half minutes to tell it ... I try to think of those little thoughts in ` Tender as I Wan na Be ' -- this guy 's pretty bold , he does n't give in very easy and he 's saying , ' I know you need me to be that way , I 'm just not .
But , when we 're doing what we 're supposed to be doing , then that 's plenty tender enough for me .
I do n't know if it is for you , but by God , it is for me . '
The secret recipe for learning how to write those kind of songs is to put down a bunch of stuff in the lyric that you would never actually say to the female .
So , there 's no way a guy like me in real life is going to be that tender .
You wish you could be but there is a wall there . ''
