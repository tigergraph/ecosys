This wistful ballad is sung by Shane MacGowan from the perspective of a World War One veteran .
The Pogues vocalist based its melody on `` Wild Mountain Thyme , '' a Folk song penned by Francis McPeake in 1957 in a traditional Irish style .
When accordion player James Fearnley first heard the song , he realized Shane MacGowan 's songwriting had gone up a level .
`` Musically that song had a timeless eternal vibe , '' Fearnley told The Irish Post December 16 , 2013 .
`` I really enjoyed the chords ; it felt like there was a circular motion about the chord progression .
The vocal melody was sublime and there was this instrumental section which had a real purity about it .
I found that very appealing . ''
`` Against that music you have lyrics which I found difficult to track , they were almost counter to the music and that was very exciting , '' added Fearnley .
`` He -LRB- MacGowan -RRB- would smash up an image in shards and rearrange it as a way to find the story .
I love the way you have Shane as narrator and how he gets through the story of the song .
There 's a jaded irony about it where he 's making light out of dismemberment and the horrors of war ; I always like that about Shane 's songs-they pack an extra punch because he holds back the punch . ''
The song was the first by The Pogues to make the UK singles chart , peaking at # 72 .
The song 's music video was directed by Alex Cox -LRB- Sid & Nancy -RRB- , who also used Rum , Sodomy & the Lash producer Elvis Costello , in his film Straight to Hell .
The clip portrayed Margaret Thatcher as a supreme , Big Brother-like authoritarian figure .
It was said to be comment on a totalitarian government and the politics of the then British Prime Minister .
