The Gaslight Anthem close their fourth album Handwritten with this string-filled closer in which Brian Fallon makes clear his feelings about digital distractions .
Having ditched his laptop in favor of writing lyrics with paper and pen , Fallon 's intention is to remind people that there are better things in live than looking at a screen .
`` I wanted to get away from computers , '' he told NME .
`` Writing by hand gives you clarity and makes you think more about what you 're going to say . ''
