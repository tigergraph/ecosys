Hugh Pescod is a Bristol born DJ and dance producer .
He started out in the early 2000s with a series of Drum & Bass releases under the moniker of DJ Clipz .
By the end of the decade , he had developed a different garage/house-based sound under the name of Redlight .
He also set up his own ` Lobster Boy ' label in 2009 for his own and other productions of similar style , starting off with The Lobster Boy EP .
Redlight achieved his first UK singles entry in early 2012 , with `` Get Out My Head . ''
This retro-dance tune is its follow-up , which was premiered on Annie Mac 's BBC Radio 1 show in June 2012 .
The song features vocals by Lottie Benardout , who is the lead vocalist of Tricity and Baby Sol .
She was born in a small town in Zaire , now known as the Democratic republic of Congo .
Sol moved to the UK in 1990 at the age of 16 , and in 2002 after auditioning with a local youth choir in West London she was signed to a management duo under Kool Music Entertainment .
The Congolian singer became part of Michelle Escoffrey 's Kindred Spirit Collective in 2004 and three years later she quit her day job to pursue a full time career in music .
Sol has since featured on DJ Ironik 's debut album and toured the UK , Europe and Australia with Paloma Faith as well as supporting Daniel Merriweather on the UK leg of his tour .
