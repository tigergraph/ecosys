This Phil Lynott composition is the opening track on the 1979 Black Rose album , and runs to 3 minutes 53 seconds .
It was also released as a single backed by `` Just The Two Of Us '' .
Although it has the trademark Thin Lizzy duel lead guitar , this track is primarily drum based , with an unusually heavy beat .
Also notable is Lynott 's allusion to the recently deceased Elvis Presley as the song fades out .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 3 -RRB- In 1977 , Eddie And The Hot Rods had a big hit with `` Do Anything You Wan na Do '' , so it is tempting to suggest that Lynott was influenced by or even plagiarised this slightly earlier song ; he would undoubtedly have heard it .
However , even the most cursory comparison suggests this is not the case ; the free-spirited Lynott was obviously writing from his own viewpoint , and apart from the similar titles , the two songs have about as much in common as has Bowie 's '' ... Laughing Gnome '' with Al Stewart 's '' ... Elf '' ; rather it is simply another of those coincidences that happen so often in music , in other disciplines , and in life itself .
