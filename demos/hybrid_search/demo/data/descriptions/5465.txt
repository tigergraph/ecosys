Lovett claims that this song is based on a true story .
He once tried to ride a pony across a pond -LSB- Hopefully it was not a deep pond and the pony was never uncomfortable .
As far as we know , Lovett is good with animals and children -RSB- , and thought it would be easier if he had a boat .
This is the lead track off of Lovett 's second album .
This album expanded his audience beyond just country music , while songs like this helped to retain some of that crowd .
