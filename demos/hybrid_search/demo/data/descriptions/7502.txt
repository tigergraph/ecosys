Singer Isaac Slade and guitarist Joe King penned this song in a remote studio in Leipers Fork , just outside of Nashville .
Slade told the story of the song to Denver Westword : `` This one came from thin air , you know ?
We started with this idea of twins , two sisters , one makes it one does n't .
We really wrote it about the one that is left , the survivor , who 's sort of wracked with guilt , like ` Why me ? '
We kind of put it in contrast to this African concept of Sankofa .
It 's basically this concept of : If your village burns down , go back to it and pick through the ashes and find anything good and then take it with you and leave and never look back .
It 's like an acknowledgment of tragedy and hardship , alongside celebration , almost , and thankfulness for what you have .
Kind of run as fast as you can from that black hole of guilt . ''
The song 's music was filmed by director Declan Whitebloom -LRB- Taylor Swift 's `` Mean '' -RRB- in the Los Angeles suburbs on February 13 , 2012 .
