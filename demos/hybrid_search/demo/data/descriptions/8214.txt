Lead singer Sonny Sandoval : `` We met a young man through the Make-A-Wish foundation when we were recording this song .
He came out to San Diego and hung out with us .
We took him all over town and then back to the studio .
Truby taught him the chords on guitar and we got him in the vocal booth to scream out in the chorus .
He 's actually on the song with us - so , no matter what , he 'll be with us forever . ''
