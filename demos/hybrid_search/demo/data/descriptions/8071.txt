Many songs about funerals tend to be gloomy affairs .
However , this track by Northern California folk/pop singer and songwriter Brett Dennen is an upbeat number .
He explained to Spinner : `` That 's the thing I think about funerals : I think they should be celebrations .
I think you grieve , and you handle your grief , but it should be a celebration of life . ''
