Many people thought the chorus was `` I 'm blue and I 'm in need of a guy , '' and that the song was about homosexuality .
The correct translation is `` I 'm blue da ba dee di , '' and in no way relates to homosexuality .
The vocals were distorted using a device called a vocoder .
Cher used a similar technique on her hit `` Believe , '' although her sound was created using an Auto-Tune device .
The Eiffel 65 members are Jeffrey Jey , Maurizio Lobina and DJ Gary Ponte .
The song came about when Lobina started playing a piano riff while Jey was writing lyrics .
Jey recalls in 1000 UK # 1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh : `` I started thinking about this character I invented called Zoroti and the lifestyle he led , from the way he would buy his house , pick his girlfriend , his job or the neighborhood he would live in .
Then I came up with a color , a color I thought described the way he saw things . ''
The group is Italian and their name came from a computer called `` Eiffel . ''
The 65 came after a note was sent with 65 accidentally written in and the members believed it was fate and should stay .
