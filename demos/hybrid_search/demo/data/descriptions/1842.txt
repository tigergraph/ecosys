This theatrical number is based on the infamous Josef Fritz case .
Fritz is an Austrian father who imprisoned his daughter , Elisabeth , for 24 years in a windowless cellar in the basement of the family home .
Elisabeth was continuously sexually abused and raped by her father and she bore him seven children , some of whom Fritz raised upstairs with his wife , whilst others were kept imprisoned with their mother .
The incestuous monster was finally caught , when Elisabeth 's eldest daughter , Kerstin , became seriously ill and was taken to hospital .
This triggered a series of events that eventually led to the discovery of the horrors going on in the basement in 2008 .
