This ode to friendship is the lead single from Ringo Starr 's 16th studio album , Y Not .
It was penned by Starr and American composer Van Dyke Parks , whose best known for his collaborations with Brian Wilson for The Beach Boys .
The track was n't originally conceived as a potential collaboration with his Fab Four mate .
McCartney , according to Starr , was originally slated just to play bass on `` Peace Dream . ''
However Starr told Billboard magazine that he listened to some of the other songs and ended up contributing a vocal to this one .
`` He heard that one and said , ` Gim me a pair of -LRB- headphones -RRB- and give me a track .
I want to do something on that , ' '' Ringo recalled .
The song is a duet between Ringo and Paul McCartney , in which McCartney echoes Starr 's vocals one beat behind .
`` I had this little idea for a harmony on one of them , '' McCartney told USA Today , `` and I said , ` You probably do n't want this , but let me show you this idea . '
And he liked it , and so I ended up singing some harmonies .
He 's great to work with .
He always was and always will be . ''
It was the first song ever to feature the two former Beatles bandmates singing in a duet .
Y Not is the first of Starr 's solo albums on which he served as primary producer .
He began the album back in 2008 `` sitting at home with nothing better to do in L.A. '' and playing around with ProTools and synthesizers he keeps there .
`` I was just sort of building up these tracks ... just having fun and seeing what happened , '' he recalled to Billboard magazine .
`` When I finally got it where I felt , ` There 's enough music now . '
I started calling people in and played 'em two tracks and said , ` I 'd like to write a song with you on one of these .
You can pick whichever track . '
That 's how we started writing . ''
