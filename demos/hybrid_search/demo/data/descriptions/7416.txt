Say Anything frontman Max Bemis has been married to Eisley singer Sherri DuPree-Bemis since April 2009 .
He wrote this song about his willingness to put up with literally anything rather than lose his wife .
`` Condemn my race to genocide if it meant that I could lay with you , '' he croons .
So why did Bemis decided to title this song after his band 's name ?
The singer explained to Billboard magazine : `` We wanted to have a flagship song , and I think the mixture between not only the fact that it says ` anything ' within the song multiple times , but the fact that the song really is a mixture of romantic notions , hopeful notions , and this dark , sort of cynical light - I think that 's pretty indicative of what the spirit of our band is . ''
