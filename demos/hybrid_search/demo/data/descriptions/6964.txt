The song is about somebody having to undergo surgery and is now struggling whether to trust science or religion , only to realize that both do n't have all the answers .
At the release of the album there was a rumor that this song was written for Radiohead singer Thom Yorke .
Stipe denied this in a 1999 interview with Q magazine .
Leonard Cohen got additional songwriting credits for this , but not because he was actively involved , rather the band felt the song had strong similarities to Cohen 's `` Suzanne . ''
When R.E.M. played the song live before the album 's release , the title was `` Boomerang . ''
