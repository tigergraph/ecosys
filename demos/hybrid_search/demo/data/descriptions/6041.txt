Swedish House Mafia is a house music group consisting of Swedish club DJs and producers Axwell , Sebastian Ingrosso and Steve Angello .
This floor filling track is a vocal version of the trio 's instrumental , `` One . ''
The song was released in the United Kingdom on July 25 , 2010 and entered at # 7 in the UK Singles chart , instantly becoming one of the most successful chart singles for any of its collaborators , though Axwell did achieve a # 6 single with his own `` I Found You '' in 2007 .
The song features American rapper Pharrell Williams , who told MTV News how his vocals ended up on the song .
`` We just kept seeing each other at festivals , '' Williams said .
`` We were doing a show and they did this beat that they played in their set , and I was like , ` Man !
That beat is crazy ! '
Finally , he was like , ` Look , just one of these days , can you drop by the studio and just do something ? '
I played a couple of chords and sang , ' I wan na know your name . '
It was really quick and really simple .
So those guys just chopped it up and just used it as they did .
They are really talented guys . ''
Christian Larson and Henrik Hanson directed the video and Pharrell does not appear in the clip .
Few changes were made between this promo and the video for `` One . ''
