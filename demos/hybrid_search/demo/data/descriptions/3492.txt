This driving anthem was written by frontman Stephen Christian for Anberlin 's 2010 record , Dark Is the Way , Light Is a Place .
While the band liked the song , they felt it did n't fit its vibe , so the tune ended up sitting in Christian 's back pocket until they recorded it for Vital .
Christian 's lyrics examine the human struggle with self-absorption .
Speaking with Artist Direct , he explained that though the song is n't about Los Angeles per se , he did have in mind the lack of introspection that pervades the city 's movie stars .
