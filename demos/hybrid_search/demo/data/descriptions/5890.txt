The Limousines frontman Eric Victorino sings about `` that little space between yellow and blue '' on this track .
When we asked him about the lyric , he explained : `` The space between any two colors is another color , but it does n't exist until the action to mix the two is taken .
Once you 've mixed the yellow and the blue , you 've got green and you can never separate them back to what they were before .
You ca n't undo the past .
You are what you are . ''
