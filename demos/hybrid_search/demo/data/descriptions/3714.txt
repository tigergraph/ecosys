The Vaccines are a four piece Indie Rock band from London who comprise vocalist and chief-songwriter Justin Young , guitarist Freddie Cowan , bassist Anri Hjorvar and drummer Pete Robinson .
This is the closing track from their debut album , What Did You Expect From The Vaccines ? .
Young -LRB- from an interview with the NME -RRB- : `` This song is about being lied to by someone you did n't expect to lie .
It 's in two parts .
The first is sweet , the second bitter .
So a bit like life , I guess . ''
The song is a hazy paean to a summer romance .
`` I am quite a nostalgic chap , '' explained Young to The Independent .
`` All of the songs on the record are looking back , none of them are looking forward . ''
