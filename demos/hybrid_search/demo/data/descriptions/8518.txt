This song is a change from the band 's usual goofy and satirical style of music .
The music is rather dreary and haunting , and a story is told that Heaven is running out of space and we 'll all someday go to hell .
The last line of the song - `` Tonight belongs to you '' - is a message that it is up to us to save ourselves while we 're still on Earth .
