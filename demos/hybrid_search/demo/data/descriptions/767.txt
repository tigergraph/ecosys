This is a track from Whitney Houston 's seventh album , I Look to You .
The song is a defiant , reflective tale of survival and strength , which finds Whitney running through a list of the folks who have helped her and those who have counted her out .
She declares that even for the haters she has nothing but love .
This R&B club track was co-written and produced by Timbaland associate Nathaniel `` Danja '' Hills and uptempo specialist Fernando Garibay .
Danja told Billboard magazine that his contribution to this track was adding subtle elements to enhance the feel of the song .
`` I loved the essence of the original track .
I did n't want to change it , '' he said .
`` Just a little bit more knock in the drums , just make sure the chorus explodes , that everybody should -LSB- dance -RSB- when they hear it . ''
