Girls Aloud originally sang backing vocals on this , but they were later removed .
Annie explained to Digital Spy how she hooked up with them : `` Well , I was working with Brian Higgins , who produces all their records , on a song called ` My Love Is Better , ' which is the first track on my album .
Girls Aloud were in the studio next door recording ` Ca n't Speak French ' and we needed some backing vocals , so Brian asked them if they 'd like to help out .
They were really up for it and came into my studio and it was really fun . ''
Annie then explained why they were removed : `` Well , something came up with the record label and they could n't be on the record after all .
It 's a bit of a shame , but it 's not as dramatic as they said in the papers .
Nobody got nasty . ''
