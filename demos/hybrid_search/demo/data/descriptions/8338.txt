An early Beatles track , this was written as the follow-up to the Beatles hit `` From Me to You , '' but was bumped in favor of `` She Loves You , '' and appeared as the B-side of that track .
This is a rare Beatles song with twin-lead vocals by McCartney and Lennon where they are not harmonizing .
John Lennon wrote most of this song , with some help from Paul McCartney on the bridge , who came up with a chord change inspired by Joan Baez ' version of `` All My Trials . ''
The song was recorded in stereo , but that version has been lost .
This remains one of 4 Beatles tracks that exist only in mono .
The others : `` Love Me Do , '' `` She Loves You , '' and `` You Know My Name -LRB- Look Up The Number -RRB- . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France for all above -RRB-
