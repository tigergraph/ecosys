Madonna and MDNA co-producer Martin Solveig share a love of movies , and this '80s sounding jam was inspired by the French film Le Samoura√Ø .
The Parisian DJ told Billboard magazine : `` We talked a lot about movies ; she has a very impressive knowledge of French film from the '60s .
It 's the story of a killer , a very solitary person ; the cinematic of the whole movie is really special .
We liked it very much , and talked about that for a little while .
On the next day I had a draft of another song called ` Beautiful Killer ' referring to that . ''
