Allen co-wrote this song about acceptance being denied with writer and producer Joe King , the guitarist and songwriter from the Fray .
Allen performed King 's version of Kanye West 's `` Heartless '' on American Idol and a few months later the pair spent two days in Timbaland 's studio in Virginia Beach , working on this song .
King told MTV News he simply responded `` Yes '' to Allen 's e-mail .
`` I did n't even see most of the show because we were on tour in Europe and Australia , '' he explained .
`` But I found out he won when we got back and I saw he did ` Heartless , ' so I was aware of him when he contacted me .
It was a very good vibe in the studio .
There was no pressure - we just had breakfast , got to know each other , '' King added .
`` It was all very organic after that . ''
King said though they recorded in Timbaland 's studio , the super-producer was n't present during the sessions .
`` But Timbaland 's brother was there along with his crew , and it added this great energy to the session .
When the boys heard the track , they started hanging around . ''
