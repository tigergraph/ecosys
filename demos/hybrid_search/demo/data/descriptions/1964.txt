This is the opening track from Welcome Home Armageddon , the fifth studio album by Welsh rock band Funeral for a Friend .
Drummer Ryan Richards told Rock Sound magazine why they penned this as an introductory track for the record : `` This actually started as a short piece of music that gave us the melody we wrote ` Old Hymns ' around .
We went back to this piece after writing ` Old Hymns ' and decided that it would work really well , not only as an intro to the song , but to the album .
We 're on our fifth album and have never used an intro track , so it seemed like a good place to start as we meant to go on - by doing something that we had never done before on a record . ''
