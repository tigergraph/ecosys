Pharrell Williams of The Neptunes was hired to produce this track .
Multi-instrumentalist Babydaddy told The Sun about the band 's collaboration with the American pop and dance uber-producer : `` We 've loved what he 's done before and we went in as fans .
But he actually had real love for the band and a drive to do something that made our band even better .
It was n't about him .
It was n't about egos .
It was about the band . ''
Frontman Jake Shears admitted to The Metro that initially he felt tense at the prospect of collaborating with Williams .
`` When I go in the studio with someone , '' he said , `` I like to know them and have a rapport with them .
I 'd only had a phone conversation with Pharrell .
Writing a song is a pretty intimate thing and going in the studio with someone as talented as he is , with an alarming knack or melody , was a bit intimidating but we wrote one of our best songs ever .
Whatever it was , it worked . ''
