David Nail penned this song with Dave Haywood and Charles Kelley of Lady Antebellum whilst out on the road with the superstar country trio .
The two L A male members carry a set up with them allowing them to record demos whilst touring .
So Haywood and Kelley laid down a guitar and piano track before Nail added his vocals .
The Missouri native joked to The Boot that the Need You Now duo sweet-talked him into cutting the song for the record .
`` It was an unspoken formality to say that it was something I dug , '' he said .
`` Then Charles definitely put on the pressure and said , ` Hey , you better cut this , or we 're going to . '
I do n't know if that was a sales pitch or him trying to manipulate the situation to make sure I cut or if it was in fact true .
It worked itself out . ''
Nail told Roughstock : `` What I like about the song more than anything is , as a guy , we often think we 're doing a lot in relaying our love and appreciation to our partner , but in reality , we 're doing a really lousy job . ''
Haywood and Kelley started the song with another songwriter , Monty Powell .
Nail explained to The Boot that the L A pair , `` were stuck in the thought process of ` is this something we should continue to work on or should we move on to something else ? ' ''
Nail walked in just as Kelley was mumbling some lines that he was n't convinced about .
However , Nail thought the lyrics , `` were really cool and different than anything I would have pursued . ''
He sat back and watched Haywood and Kelley work and `` was more or less a referee to say , ' I like that ' or ` Maybe we should explore something else here . ' ''
He felt privileged to have the opportunity `` to sit on the bus and watch it all come to life . ''
Country music singer-songwriter Hillary Lindsey , who 's written several of Carrie Underwood 's hits , provided additional vocals on this song .
