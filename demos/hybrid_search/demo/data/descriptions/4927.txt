George Michael released this song to mark the thirtieth anniversary of his first entry in the UK singles chart .
He described the track as a `` thank you to everybody who has been a part of -LSB- his -RSB- success '' , adding : `` I mean everybody , including the press !! Long may it continue . ''
The song was made available to download on August 12 , 2012 , 30 years after George first entered the UK singles chart with Wham !
's `` Young Guns -LRB- Go For It ! -RRB- . ''
The release also contains a previously unreleased cover of Tim Buckley 's 1970 hit `` Song To The Siren . ''
The song references Michael 's battle with pneumonia in late 2011 , during which he came close to losing his life .
`` Was it science that saved me , or the way that you prayed for me ?
Either way I thank you , I 'm alive , '' he sings .
George Michael sang this during the London Olympic Games closing ceremony , marking the former Wham singer 's first performance since his life-threatening illness .
Whilst other artists sang some of their best known songs , Michael went with a new one .
Responding to criticism that he used the event to plug his new material , Michael said : `` It was my one chance on TV to thank you all for your loyalty and prayers , and I took it .
And I do n't regret it . ''
