This one of several songs on The Next Day inspired by Bowie 's fascination with medieval history .
The album 's producer Tony Visconti told Billboard magazine : `` He 's been reading history books , and we were having great conversations in the studio about , well , British monarchy for a start and stories related to them .
A couple of songs on this album are about historical subjects .
Some of the lyrics are blood-curdling , they really are - very , very strong lyrics about old wars , things like that . ''
According to Visconti , Bowie wrote many of the songs for The Next Day on keyboards , resulting in him tapping into his jazz roots .
This track in particular with its experimental sounds and polyrhythms is particularly jazzy .
Visconti told The Ottowa Citizen : `` The song called If You Can See Me has very wide , beautiful , crunchy jazz chords , with time signatures that Dave Brubeck would be proud of . ''
