Everlast wrote this and sang lead .
The term `` Put Your Lights On '' basically means `` Watch Out , '' and is frequently addressed to the `` sinners . ''
When Everlast -LRB- Erik Schrody -RRB- left House Of Pain , he gave up alcohol and nicotine , then converted to Islam .
The song has a religious meaning to him , and even includes the Muslim prayer `` La Ilaha Il Allah , '' which translates to `` There is only Allah . ''
Everlast was n't sure if he should leave that part in , but Santana , who is a very spiritual being , wanted it in there .
In addition to writing this , Everlast also sang and played guitar on this song .
-LRB- thanks , Jim - Oxnard , CA -RRB- Everlast had a house in the mountains where he could see a city below .
He was inspired by the lights that would come on one by one at sunset .
