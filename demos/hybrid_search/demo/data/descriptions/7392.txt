Despite name checking the Clan , this is a very un-Wu-Tang like track .
Noah `` 40 '' Shebib 's beat is a somber piano loop backed by percussion rather than borrowing from the Staten Island Hip-Hop act 's anthemic style .
Apart from one namecheck , Drake 's rhymes do not allude to the '90s group ; instead it finds him detailing some ex-girlfriends as well as his rapping success .
However , Drake does sample the title phrase from `` It 's Yourz , '' a triumphant track from the New York crew 's landmark 1997 album , Wu-Tang Forever .
Drizzy also start his verse by repurposing Raekwon 's opening bars from the same Wu cut : `` Machine gun raps for all my n -- s in the back Stadium packed , just glad to see the city on the map . ''
Jhen√© Aiko contributes some guest vocals toward the end of the track .
The Los Angeles singer-songwriter also hooked up with Big Sean on his `` Beware '' single and with J. Cole on his Born Sinner track , `` Sparks Will Fly . ''
Wu-Tang Clan member , Inspectah Deck , had some beef with the song title , posting on Twitter : `` After listening to the @Drake song , I agree with u. . .
It is in no form a tribute to WU and SHOULD NOT wear the title Wutang Forever ! ''
However , other members of his crew appeared to less bothered as some of them , including U-God and Method Man , recorded the tune 's official remix .
U-God said he only had a short time to write and record his verse for the remix while he and the rest of the Clan were on the road in Europe .
`` We only had like two hours in the studio to write this joint because we were on a tour when we got the remix , '' he explained to MTV News .
`` I did n't get a joint to marinate on it too tough , so I just threw my dart how I felt .
I was sayin ' some murderous s -- , I was sayin ' some rawness on there . ''
