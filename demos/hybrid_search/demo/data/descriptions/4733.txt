This is the second single from Blink 182 drummer and hip-hop producer Travis Barker 's debut album , Give the Drummer Some .
The song features Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Wu-Tang Clan de facto leader RZA on guitars plus the latter 's fellow Wu colleague Raekwon on the mic .
The song 's music video was directed by Petro Papahadjopoulos -LRB- TV on the Radio , Incubus -RRB- and simply shows the four friends jamming together .
`` There was never any corny ideas -LSB- for the video -RSB- , '' Barker said with a smile to MTV News . ''
-LSB- It 's -RSB- just us rocking out .
That 's what 's good about it .
The track 's raw ; it 's not candy-coated .
This is like ` punch you in the face , ' real hype music . ''
Barker explained to MTV News how he got the all-star line up on board : `` The song started with RZA and I in my studio , with him playing guitars and me playing drums , just jamming out , '' he explained .
`` Then I got Raekwon on it , and I showed it to Tom Morello , who was stoked on it , so he played on it . ''
The album title is taken from a 1988 track of the same name from Hip Hop group The Ultramagnetic MC 's .
The phrase `` Give the drummer some '' was popularized by James Brown .
