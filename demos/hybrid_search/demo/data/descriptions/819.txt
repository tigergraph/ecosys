The Little Big Town quartet wanted to showcase their live sound on Tornado , so they came into the studio at 6 p.m. to record as if they were rehearsing for a performance later that night .
`` We just wanted to do something different .
That was our producer 's idea , Jay Joyce , '' Kimberly Schlapman explained to Billboard magazine .
`` He wanted us to come in like we were playing a show and to have the energy and a little bit pressure like it is to put on a show .
He wanted us to sing it live and put us on the spot a little bit .
That was his idea and it worked like a charm . ''
This good-timin ' party song was written by the four members of Little Big Town with Nashville-based songwriter Luke Laird .
The version that ended up on Tornado evolved into something completely different than how it was originally written .
LBT 's Jimi Westbrook recalled to The Boot : `` We got in and experimented with it .
It turned into this thing that was so much fun and had so much energy .
The band was jamming on the outro on just one take and Jay said , ` That 's really cool , what you 're doing , let 's throw that part under the verse melody . ' ''
