This bittersweet tune represents to Civil Wars member Joy Williams , `` the ache of monogamy . ''
She explained : `` This is n't an ` I 'm leaving you ' song .
It 's a vulnerable confession of ' I do n't want to leave .
I want to work on this - with you . ' ''
`` Having said that , '' she continued , `` someone once told me a story about long-term relationships : to think of them as a continent to explore .
I could spend a lifetime backpacking through Africa , and I would still never know all there is to know about that continent .
To stay the course , to stay intentional , to stay curious and connected -- that 's the heart of it .
But it 's so easy to lose track of the trail , to get tired , to want to give up , or to want a new adventure .
It can be so easy to lose sight of the goodness and mystery within the person sitting right in front of you .
That continent idea inspires me , and makes the ache when it comes hurt a little less .
To know that it happens to all of us .
What I 'm realizing now is that sometimes the ` same old same old ' can actually be rich , worthwhile and a great adventure . ''
