Following a secret SXSW show in March 2011 , the Mystery Jets set up a home recording studio in a country house by the Colorado river in the Westlake area in Austin , Texas .
During their flight to Texas the band encountered a missionary from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who tried to recruit guitarist William Rees to the Mormon faith .
This song is based on that experience and the title is taken from her business card , which she handed to Rees as they landed .
