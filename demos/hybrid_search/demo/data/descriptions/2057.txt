Avril enlisted her fianc√© , Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger , to help her pen this song .
Other credited writers include Dave Hodges , Martin Johnson , J.Kash , and Serban Ghenea .
This marked Lavigne 's first release since she signed with L.A. Reid 's Epic Records in 2011 .
`` It 's really exciting for me , because L.A. Reid signed me , '' she told MTV News about working with her longtime mentor again .
`` He met me when I was 15 , and he signed me on the spot .
We did my first album together , and it was really successful and then what happens in the record industry , you know , changes are made .
We did n't get to work together , and I was so bummed out , 'cause I never had that connection with anyone ever again , like , my whole career at the record company . ''
Lavigne told Billboard magazine that Reid loved this song as soon as he heard it .
`` He came into the studio and I played him a bunch of tracks , and when ` Here 's To Never Growing Up ' came on , he stood up and was applauding , '' she recalled .
`` I wanted it to be the single , and I did n't say anything to him -- I just played him all the music , and he was excited about this one .
I wanted to write something that was a feel-good song , a summer song . ''
Lavigne kicks off the song with the line `` Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs . ''
She told Billboard magazine she is talking about the English band 's hit single `` Creep . ''
At the 2:06 mark on the video , we see Lavigne donning her signature `` Complicated '' look -LRB- white tie , board shorts and white tank top -RRB- .
She then skateboards through an empty high school hallway , as a visual homage to the clip for her 2002 breakthrough single .
L.A. Reid decided to lead Avril 's fifth album with this song as soon as he heard it .
`` It felt good when I was recording it in the booth when I was singing it .
I performed it at 11 o'clock at night and we were in this huge rush ... so the producer stayed in the studio and pulled an all-nighter , '' Lavigne explained to MTV News .
`` And when I came back in the next day I heard it .
I was like , ` That sounds like a single , I think this is it . '
And when we played it for L.A. , immediately he was like , ` This is it .
OK , let 's go ; let 's put it out . '
I 'm like , ` What do you mean ?
I 'm not done with my record . ' ''
The song was produced by Martin Johnson who is the frontman of Pop-Punk band Boys Like Girls , and has previously helmed tracks for the likes of Taylor Swift , Miley Cyrus and Good Charlotte .
Lavigne told Los Angeles radio personality Ryan Seacrest about the song : `` It 's a Pop-Rock tune , '' she said .
`` And it 's just about being young , having fun , being present , living in the moment and that 's what I love to do .
This is one of the newer tunes -LSB- we recorded -RSB- .
It was me and four dudes and I wanted to write something really fun , like a summer song . ''
Lavigne admitted to MTV News that she ca n't take credit for the high school prom-themed visual .
`` I had my own concept for this video , '' she said .
`` And then last minute , we changed it because the director -LSB- Robert Hales -RSB- came up with a concept and the concept was just ` prom ' .
And that was really it .
`` I thought , ` that 's an awesome idea , 'cause we can dress up , the band can be in cool tuxedos . '
That was way more fun than I anticipated , '' she added .
The song finds Avril reminding her fans that it 's OK to be forever youthful .
`` It 's pop rock , up-tempo .
It 's a fun song , '' she told MTV News .
`` It 's about wanting to be young forever .
Does n't matter what age you are ; it 's all about your spirit , state of mind .
And I know I certainly do n't want to grow up . ''
