The first single by Canadian rapper Drake , from his second studio album , Take Care , was produced by his longtime producers and collaborators Matthew `` Boi-1da '' Samuels and Noah `` 40 '' Shebib .
It first premiered on Drake 's blog , October 's Very Own , on July 31st , 2011 and was made available free to download .
Drake told Billboard magazine why he released this as the first single from Take Care .
`` By no means is it the best song on my album , it 's really just the song for this moment , right now , '' he said .
`` I always try to put forth a song with a message .
A lot of people pick their single by what 's the strongest song .
I do n't really do that .
I like to make sure that the content is very relevant to right now .
I want people to party to it but at the same time the fans , the people that care about my career , the people that follow me , will hear a message in it . ''
Shebib told MTV News how he and Drake had radio in mind when they cut this track : `` That 's a catchy song .
` They know , they know , they know , ' '' he said .
`` It 's corny , it 's catchy , it 's perfect .
That will run on radio all day .
You balance with those evils when you make music .
I understand what 's going to work on radio as much , sometimes I want to make different types of music .
But the thing is , you want to win .
You want to have your cake and eat it too . ''
The song finds Drake thoughtfully ruminating about the consequences of fame .
`` I might be too strung out on compliments , '' he raps .
`` Overdosed on confidence / Starting not to give a f -- k and stop fearing the consequence . ''
The video was directed by OVO crew members Lamar Taylor and Hyghly Alleyne and shot in Drake 's hometown of Toronto , Canada .
It is a family affair featuring members of some of the rapper/singer 's friends such as T-Minus , Noah `` 40 '' Shebib , The Weeknd , Boi-1da and Kromatik , but none of his Young Money label mates .
