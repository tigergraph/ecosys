Hanson open their Anthem album with this song , which Taylor Hanson described to The Idolator as being `` like the pregame -LSB- track -RSB- that gets people kind of going before an activity . ''
The song has been used by Fox Sports during their basketball coverage as well as by the band 's local Oklahoma City Thunder NBA team .
Taylor Hanson told The Idolator : `` We are huge Thunder fans , and I have to say Isaac is the biggest sports nerd .
He can go down every stat .
We love the Thunder .
A couple of years ago , we made a connection with them because we 're fans , and they asked us to sing the national anthem at a game .
So we got to know the team a little bit .
When we put out this record , we just stayed in communication with the team , and they were looking for music .
And ` Fired Up ' just seemed -LSB- to fit -RSB- the energy of the season . ''
