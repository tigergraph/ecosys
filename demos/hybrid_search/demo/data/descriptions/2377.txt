This is the lead single from the Glasgow rock band Glasvegas 's second album , Euphoric Heartbreak .
It was recorded in Los Angeles under producer Flood -LRB- Smashing Pumpkins , U2 -RRB- .
The official record title contains three forward and three backward slashes , which frontman James Allan claims represent , `` the ascent , the crest of a wave , and then the crash . ''
James described `` Euphoria '' to the NME as a song about choices , `` and opposites .
The crossroads , man , it 's the choices .
Vincent Van Gogh , Wheatfield with Crows .
The past , man , and the choices you have .
`` Van Gogh 's famous Wheatfield with Crows painting shows a large field of wheat against a dark forbidding sky , with crows circle menacingly overhead .
The observer is faced with the indecision of three separate paths in the foreground .
The song was inspired by an experience when James Allan and his guitarist cousin Rab Allan were in Santa Monica staying at the beach house .
James recalled to the Sunday Mail : `` One night when we were looking out over the sea , the sun looked so bright reflecting off the water it was like fireworks .
It seemed to dance with the music in my head . ''
The Euphoric Heartbreak album sleeve features an image of Marilyn Monroe shot during the filming of her last movie , the never-finished screwball comedy Something 's Got To Give .
Photographer George Barris took the shot on a Santa Monica beach close to where Glasvegas wrote the album .
In a freaky moment of serendipity , James Allan had expressed his fondness for the picture before he found out where it had been taken .
The sleeve is meant to show him looking out from the house towards Marilyn on the beach .
