The first single by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs from their Mosquito album finds Karen O singing about `` falling for a guy '' with a `` halo round his head . ''
The track was premiered on February 25 , 2013 on Zane Lowe 's UK BBC Radio 1 show .
The video stars British model turned actress Lily Cole as a promiscuous character who has a number of affairs with local residents -LRB- you might have seen her in in Terry Gilliam 's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus -RRB- .
None of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs members make an appearance in the conceptual clip .
Karen O told NME that the first version the band was recorded of this song was terrible .
`` Then it hit me , '' she continued . ''
` You know what would make it really great ?
A gospel choir . '
I 'd been listening to Lou Reed 's Transformer a lot and I loved those soulful back-up singers . ''
The bombastic , epic song 's concept of the violation of the sacrosanct is emphasized during its outro as a 24-piece gospel choir takes the song to a spiritual climax .
As the Broadway Gospel Choir recorded their vocals for this song , Karen O stood in the center of the group , absorbing the vibration of their pleading and praying .
`` I never experienced anything like that , man , '' she told Spin magazine .
`` It was hair-raising , it was spine-tingling . ''
Karen explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` You can think of this as someone who 's out of your league and not knowing if you can hold court with them , '' she said .
`` It also could be about finding out something about someone you do n't know already .
There 's a lot of Earth angels out there , man . ''
