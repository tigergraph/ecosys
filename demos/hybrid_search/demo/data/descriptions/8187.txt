This is the lead single and title track from Youngstown , Ohio native Emii 's debut album .
Produced by Adrian Gurvitz , the fun , sexy cut begs the timeless question : `` Is he the right one for me ? ''
Emii said of writing for the album : `` I loved writing these songs because of the challenge of translating what I was feeling into the melodies and lyrics .
That could be dangerous at times , but I knew as long as I put my heart into it the emotions would come out . ''
