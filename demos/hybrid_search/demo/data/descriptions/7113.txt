This is the title track and second single from Man on the Moon II : The Legend of Mr. Rager , the sophomore album from American rapper Kid Cudi .
The single was officially released digitally on iTunes on October 25 , 2010 .
Cudi explained the song 's meaning in an interview with Complex Magazine : `` This song is about someone who is fed up with reality , who looks for thrills and excitement by any means .
It 's just kind of how I was feeling at that point .
I was just so angry .
Doing coke revived me , and knowing I was so close to death every time intrigued me .
I liked the thought of it .
`` Cudi went on to discuss his drug problems , which he alludes to as well on other Rager tracks such as `` Wild 'n Cuz I 'm Young . ''
While the rapper did n't touch on alcoholism , he did vow to give up cocaine .
`` No more blow , '' he told Complex Magazine .
`` People do drugs to camouflage emotions and run away from their problems . ''
The album is a follow-up to Man on the Moon : The End of Day , which offered a portrait of Cudi as an introspected young man growing up in the shadow of his father 's death .
This second set deals with the protagonist 's difficulty in adjusting to his new found fame .
