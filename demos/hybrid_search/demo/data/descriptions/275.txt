In our interview , Whitechapel guitarist Ben Savage said that `` Make it Bleed '' is one of the songs he 's most proud of writing .
It was formed from a few separate riffs that the band had been toying with for a long time without ever being able to piece them together into a cohesive song .
However , they finally together very abruptly and spontaneously during a recording session , and `` Make it Bleed '' was born.Savage also noted that the song is one of his favorites to play live , thanks to how dynamically it flows .
This appears on the band 's self-titled 2012 album , Whitechapel .
The eponymous record saw an increased level of sophistication in the band 's sound and songwriting , and was almost universally well received .
The song is a furious exploration of whether or not there is any meaning to life on earth when there is so much pain and suffering , and if there is any possibility of a transcendent afterlife .
It also touches on weighty themes such as suicide -LRB- `` This life ; it 's a tragedy , someone get me out , someone please help tonight ; I have realized this is my last night to be alive '' -RRB- .
It 's ultimately an ambiguous , frustrated lament to the difficulty of finding meaningful things in the world .
The album cover , which depicts three stars inside of a circular sawblade , is a mash-up of the band 's logo and the Tennessee state flag , their home state .
