This contains snippets from the 2005 horror/thriller movie The Exorcism of Emily Rose .
The album title is taken from a lyric in this song .
Frontman Spencer Chamberlain told Christian Music Today why they named their set Lost in the Sound of Separation .
He explained : `` The whole story is all pretty much the last two years of my life .
It could be interpreted as me trying to separate the things that I should be doing -- what God is actually calling me to do -- and the things that I actually do .
As Christians , we fall all the time and do things that are selfish .
We know what we 're supposed to do , but ca n't always hear which voice in our heads is the right one and the wrong one .
Lost in the Sound of Separation is trying to string out and differentiate all the different voices talking at the same time in our heads : the conscience of God , best friends , parents , and anyone telling us -LSB- what do to and how to live -RSB- . ''
