Lead singer Ed Macfarlane told Drowned in Sound : `` I was feeling a little left out singing on my own , so I forced the other band members to sing along with me .
We wrote the vocal line ` climbing on , climbing on board ' and ever since then its been a constant struggle to remove the hook from our heads .
Its also the only song I know of which contains the word ` defibrilating . ' ''
This was used in North American television commercials for the Nintendo Wii Fit .
It also featured in the trailer for the Play Station game Gran Turismo 5 .
