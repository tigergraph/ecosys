1 -RRB- .
The song is a collaboration with `` I Got ta Feelin ' '' producer David Guetta .
Flo told MTV News : `` David Guetta has been a guy who I look up to .
He 's definitely been big around the world and has always been there to let me know that my music is hot , and vice versa .
So I definitely appreciate doing this big record with him . ''
The song also features on the soundtrack of the Disney movie Step Up 3-D .
This was Flo Rida 's second UK # 1 following his debut trip to the summit , `` Right Round . ''
He was also a featured artist on Alexandra Burke 's chart-topper `` Bad Boys . ''
Guetta recalled to MTV News how the collaboration came about : `` I was always playing a bootleg with ` Love is Gone ' and ` Low , ' from him , '' Guetta recalled .
`` One day , his record company called me and asked me if I would produce records for him .
I was like , ` Yeah !
Of course !
Because I knew it was working in every club I was playing already . ''
The song 's music video is set in an opulent , extravagant club party .
`` This video right here is just , if you 've ever dreamed about having the biggest party of your life , ` Club Ca n't Handle Me ' definitely represents that , '' Flo Rida told MTV News .
`` Lotta energy .
Lot of diamonds , ice sculptures .
Just showing that boss vibe .
So I mean really , the club ca n't handle me . ''
Flo Rida told Billboard magazine the song was inspired by `` just traveling around the world , '' which included some shows with Guetta .
`` Every time we did a show together it was like we were the life of the party , '' he recalled , `` so we were talking about definitely hooking up and doing a record together .
-LSB- Guetta -RSB- sent me the production and I created my own lyrics , and that 's how we made the track . ''
