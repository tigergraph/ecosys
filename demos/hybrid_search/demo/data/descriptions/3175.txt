Bennington told Rolling Stone that he formed Dead By Sunrise as an outlet for some new songs he 'd written , `` that felt and sounded really good , but were n't right stylistically for Linkin Park .
They were darker and moodier than anything I 'd come up with for the band . ''
Bennington told Artistdirect.com about this song : `` I wrote that song specifically about being away from my family and my wife , and how I really do n't like that .
I get into a very dark place .
I 'd battled relapse at that point .
I 'd been away from her for so long that I was like , `` I 'm not doing well -- I want to drink or do something . ''
That 's the kind of thought process that my brain goes into -- well , it 's bad , let 's make it worse .
That 's not cool , you know ? ''
