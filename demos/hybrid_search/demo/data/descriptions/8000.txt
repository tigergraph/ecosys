Billboard magazine asked if the Mr. Richards character in the song is a politician .
Frontman Michael Stipe replied : '' ` Mr. Richards ' is definitely a political figure .
It 's about injustices and one of those great injustices - and you 'll find plenty of examples of it in the current U.S. administration - is people that get away with something that is almost inhuman .
Rather than that being shameful , they wear it like a badge of honor .
The fact that they did something so corrupt and actually got away with it , rather than just dropping it into the bottom drawer of their desk , it 's like , ` I 'm even more Teflon than you think I am . '
Like , ` Look at what I can do . ' ''
