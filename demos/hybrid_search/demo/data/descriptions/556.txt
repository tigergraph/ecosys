The second single from Brad Paisley 's debut album , Who Needs Pictures , this became his first Country # 1 in December 1999 , holding the top spot for one week .
This was written from the perspective of a son of a single mother ; we hear how the single mom begins dating a new man who immediately builds a relationship with the child as well .
Lovelace co-penned it from personal experience having become a step-dad to McCain Merren when he married his wife , Karen .
According to an interview with the songwriter in USA Weekend magazine , Paisley said to him , `` Let 's make a song about you two that will make your wife cry . ''
The song was later included on Paisley 's 2009 album , Playlist : The Very Best of Brad Paisley , as well as on his 2010 Hits Alive record .
The song was penned by Paisley with his frequent co-writer and best friend Kelley Lovelace and based on the latter 's relationship with his stepson McCain Merren . ''
` He Did n't Have to Be ' was probably the most life-changing three minutes that I 've ever written , because I really believe we would n't be sitting here anymore talking , '' Paisley said .
`` Maybe we 'd be sitting here with me having written a # 1 song for somebody else , but I do n't think I 'd still have a record deal without that song .
It broke the ice for me with radio .
It was like you could see potential in it , and that 's an important thing .
I was really lucky , it was n't like we knew what we were doing .
I just happened -LSB- to write -RSB- that with my best friend from the bottom of my heart about his situation . ''
Top session drummer Eddie Bayers played on this .
The winner of the Academy of Country Music 's Drummer of the Year Award for eight straight years , Bayers has played on songs by the likes of John Denver , George Straitt , The Beach Boys , Garth Brooks , Glen Campbell , Kenny Chesney and Elton John .
