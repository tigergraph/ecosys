This party anthem was inspired by an incident when Labrinth was touring .
He explained to The Sun : `` On the tour we had loads of moshpits and at one point a girl came up to me and showed me she had a tooth knocked out because it was so crazy .
She was saying it was the best night of her life .
I said ` What are you talking about ?
You 've lost a tooth ' . ''
