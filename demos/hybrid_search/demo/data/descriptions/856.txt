The Script open their third album with this track which reflects the band 's philosophy of enjoying music and having fun .
The band 's pals back home in Dublin inspired the song .
Guitarist Mark Sheehan told The Sun that it is about spending time with friends in their drinking establishment : '' ` Good Ol' Days ' was born out of excitement , '' he explained .
At our local pub , people would bring in instruments like a tambourine , a tin whistle or a banjo .
Someone would stand up to tell a poem , a story or sing their heart out and we 'd all listen .
You 'd be engrossed or there 'd be tears .
That 's what that song is about .
It 's about tipping the hat to those traditions that are slightly lost today .
We need the good ol' days in the future .
It 's a positive spin on a night out . ''
