In an interview on Coldplay 's website , frontman Chris Martin said that he felt the songs on Viva La Vida and the Prospekt 's March EP are `` all part of the same family . ''
He added that because this song is , `` a little heavier for example , we felt like , ` Let 's put the album out and then if it does OK we 'll put out those songs that we were maybe a little shy about putting out . ' ''
