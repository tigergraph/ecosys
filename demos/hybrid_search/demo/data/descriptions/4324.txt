Kimberly Schlapman of Little Big Town lost her husband to a heart attack in 2005 , and that event inspired this song .
Phillip Sweet of LBT told us : `` We kind of vicariously lived through Kimberly 's emotion of her losing her husband to a heart attack several years back .
We let her play the role of the actress , of the loss that you experience in the song .
But she really experienced a loss of death in her own marriage .
So there was a lot of emotion to dig from in there .
But we started writing that in the previous record , and then when we came around to writing for The Reason Why , we dusted it off , and that 's when we changed the ` oh well ' to ' I guess . '
And everything came together , and we were like , ` this song feels perfect . '
It says it . ''
The band started recording this song for their 2007 album A Place to Land , but they could n't finish it .
Speaking of how Schlapman gets through the song and reviving it for The Reason Why , Sweet says : `` I think she was at the place where she was strong enough to play that emotion out without it overwhelming her .
I think she had a few moments where it was emotional , but she was strong enough to step out and come back in .
It was n't like just total breakdown , which it had been in the previous record .
That 's why we could n't go there and really make that for A Place to Land .
It was n't ready.A lot of songs can stick around and then they find their life , they find their home .
So to us , we always just try to stay open and we always try to sift through some of the ones that did n't make it from the last one .
Very few of those even make it to the next process , because you always want to write the next thing or the new thing or this new idea you 're inspired by . ''
