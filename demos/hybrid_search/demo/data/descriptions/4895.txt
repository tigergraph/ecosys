This was inspired by George Orwell 's 1946 essay Decline of the English Murder , in which he lamented the way traditional domestic poisoning dramas were disappearing .
Pete Doherty comments in the October 2007 edition of Q Magazine that he meant to call this song `` Decline of the English Murder , '' but he `` could n't remember the Orwellian bent on it . ''
