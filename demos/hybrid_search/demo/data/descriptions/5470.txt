Earthshine , an astronomic phenomena first described by Leonardo Da Vinci in the Codex Leicester between 1506 and 1510 , is the term describing the sunlight which is reflected by the Earth to illuminate the Moon .
This happens every 29.5 Earth-days , hence the lyric `` on certain nights , when the angles are right ... '' Alex Lifeson , Rockline , May 13 , 2002 : `` Earthshine was the first song that we wrote .
At the time we both felt that we were n't going to be too precious about it , it was part of that early period that we went through with the writing , about 5 months into the project I guess ?
Six months ?
We reviewed the song and decided to completely rewrite it .
There were some lyrical changes , but 100 % of the music was thrown into the garbage , and we started over again with it .
Which was really a testament to working this way without a deadline , and how important it was not to have a deadline with this record . ''
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Mountlake Terrace , Washington , for all above -RRB- Geddy Lee , Rockline , May 13 , 2002 : `` Earthshine was just not right in its original incarnation .
The lyrics were very interesting , and very evocative , but I did n't feel in the end-and Alex agreed-that the music really equaled what was there lyrically .
We were selling the lyrics short .
So we had this jam music that we really were excited about , especially this riff , this main riff , that is the verses for Earthshine , and I rebuilt the song vocally around that riff .
Then we proceed to just carry on with it , and before we knew it we had a whole knew song that was really exciting . ''
