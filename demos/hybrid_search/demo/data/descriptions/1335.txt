Escovedo trades lines with Bruce Springsteen on this tightly woven upbeat tune .
The two rockers had previously teamed up in 2008 when Springsteen invited the Texan singer onstage for a joint performance of the Real Animal track `` Always a Friend . ''
Escovedo told Express Night Out about this collaboration : '' ` Faith ' was the song that I wrote that I really thought would sum up the record in a way .
Soon as I wrote it , I had heard that Bruce might be interested in singing on it .
So it seemed like a perfect song for him to sing , and I kind of wrote it with that in mind , in a way . ''
