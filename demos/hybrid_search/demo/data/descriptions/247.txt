This tale of verbal abuse finds the protagonist taking refuge in the strength of language .
Williams explained to Elsewhere : `` The person inside the song is dealing with one of those situations you find yourself in when you are in the wrong relationship and there is yelling and someone is verbally abusing you . ''
`` It 's about the victim finding salvation and shelter within her words , '' she continued .
`` She can go to that place that nobody can touch , and her songs can become a way of vindication . ''
`` You have to be able to become the subject of the song to have the passion for the subject , '' Williams added .
`` But even when I 'm writing in the third person I 'm always writing about myself . ''
