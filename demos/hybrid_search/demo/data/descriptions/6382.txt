Alison Goldfrapp whistled the bird noises that are heard at the end of the song .
Blackbook magazine asked Alison Goldfrapp about why the duo used clown imagery on the album .
She replied : `` It came out of one of the songs being called ` Clowns . '
They 're still a fascination for a lot of artists .
-LSB- But -RSB- it 's more a harlequin image that I used .
There 's a certain mystique about a harlequin and the idea they can be very throwaway or trivial but also quite cunning .
Playful , but in a melancholic way . ''
This was the first song the duo recorded for the album .
`` Clowns ' '' origins were in a jam session , its dreamy folk sound was to set the agenda for the rest of the album .
Will Gregory told Pitchfork Media that the string arrangements on this were inspired by those of Robert Kirby , who is best known for his work on the Nick Drake albums .
He said : `` Robert Kirby 's string arrangements are brilliant - they 're so lovely .
That became a of a goal , the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , if you could like - if we could get strings that sounded anything like that .
And we never did , and it was probably wrong to even try .
But yeah , they 're lovely . ''
