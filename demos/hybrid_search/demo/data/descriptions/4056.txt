Darius Rucker -LRB- from his record label 's website -RRB- : `` It was inspired by -LSB- songwriter -RSB- Chris Stapleton .
We were talking about how much he loves to call people when he 's drunk , and he 'll either be really sweet or he 'll cuss them out .
When I used to drink I did that , too .
That song was n't written so much about my view of life now ; it 's more where I was six or seven years ago , in the middle of being a rock star .
I do n't feel like one any more and that 's a good thing .
The Jammer mentioned in the song is one of my best friend 's bars in Charleston .
That 's one thing that I really want to express in my country career : I want to give my music a sense of place and who I am .
I 'm from Charleston .
I want people to know that in the same way that they know George Strait is from Texas , or Bruce Springsteen is from New Jersey . ''
