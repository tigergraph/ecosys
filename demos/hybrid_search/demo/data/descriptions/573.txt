Appearing on the `` Achin ' '' side of Bundy 's Achin ' and Shakin ' album , `` Cigarette '' is a song about regret that the stage actress-turned-singer wrote with producer Nathan Chapman .
The idea is that instead of kissing the guy , she should have smoked a cigarette , because it would have been healthier .
In our interview with Laura Bell Bundy , she explained : `` This whole Achin ' & Shakin ' stuff is about relationships , and it 's about vices .
And the time I was in my life was the time where I was coming into my own and I stopped judging myself for trying these things , and for making mistakes .
And yeah , I 've been in a situation where I 've cheated , and I 'm sorry about it , and I do n't want to do it again , and I could lose somebody for doing it .
So that 's personal .
I 've been in a situation where I have regret , where I should have left my lipstick on the cigarette . ''
Bundy told us that this is her favorite song on the album , adding , `` I like the second verse .
Your first verse is better than your second , the second one can sometimes be a throwaway .
But this song , it was like , Oh my god , we love the second verse .
It was all this comparison with ashes to ashes , cigarette smoke , and dying slowly .
And I love the idea of I should have left my lipstick on a cigarette .
I love that it 's a beautiful way and an ironic way of having regret . ''
