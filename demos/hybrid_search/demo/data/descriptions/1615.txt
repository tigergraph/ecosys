This song finds Dave Gahan crooning : `` The angel of love is upon me .
Lord , I feel so small , so weak , '' suggesting a conflicted soul .
Guitarist/keyboardist Martin Gore told Q magazine with a laugh : `` It 's got a head-banging quality , which is different for us , but it 's still our usual kind of love song with a bit of religion thrown in . ''
The teenage Martin Gore went along to St Paul 's Methodist church in Basildon as an observer with the more devout -LRB- ex Depeche Mode member -RRB- Vince Clarke and -LRB- current keyboardist -RRB- Andrew Fletcher .
There are `` souls '' all over Delta Machine 's lyrics and this song reflects Gore 's memory of church-goers , speaking in tongues .
He told Q magazine : `` To this day I wish that I could follow some kind of religion , but I find it impossible . ''
