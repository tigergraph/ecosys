Many of the tales told on National Ransom are sad , heart-rending stories .
Costello explained to Spinner UK why he concludes the album on a positive note .
Said the singer : `` I take it from that we 're in a moment that we 've been in before in many other circumstances , that people are all sharing the experience of song .
We 're going over the edge of a cliff maybe here .
I think the humanity in the characters , all the little struggles that are described in these songs , I always hope that we 'll take it out that really the best that we can find within ourselves in these times is not the appeal of fanaticism , intolerance - that 's the truth of it .
That 's why I think songs are worth singing and worth hearing and being together .
That 's why the record ends like it does , with ` Voice in the Dark , ' which is a hopeful song .
So there has to be something better within us than all of that .
I 'm looking for that , even the smallest bit of light in the picture in all of these songs .
I 'm trying to find some beauty in all of this , otherwise it would truly be intolerable .
There would n't be any reason for us to make any more records or sing any more songs . ''
