Chairlift vocalist Caroline Polachek told NME that the song started life as a dream .
She explained : `` In my imagination of what 's happening in that song , something really bad is about to happen and I 'm trying to scoot my whole family out before the bad thing . ''
Polachek described Something as an autobiographical record , `` not super literally , but in terms of the moods . ''
It reflects the tension that the duo felt with regard to the `` different kinds of relationships and all of the normal bulls -- t that comes with growing up .
`` She went on to say that , `` there 's something really sexy and groovy about the way , '' this song `` sounds superficially , '' adding , `` but then you listen to the lyrics and there 's this kind of dark tension there , but yet there 's still a kind of catharsis in it .
It 's not dark for the sake of being dark .
It 's just describing the push and pull . ''
