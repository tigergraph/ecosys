Train frontman Pat Monahan wrote this song with the Country Music songwriter Allen Shamblin , whose biggest hit , `` I Ca n't Make You Love Me , '' was co-penned with Mike Reid and recorded by Bonnie Raitt .
This simple acoustic love ballad finds Monahan celebrating the freshness of a new love before it becomes more complex .
Monahan told Radio.com the story of the song : `` Somehow Allan inspired that vibe in me , '' he said .
`` It 's a definite truth , that song .
I sent it to my manager in New York and he was like , ` How did you think of this ?
Actually , the better question is , how is this the first time anyone has thought of this ? '
He said , ` It 's so simple .
It 's so true .
Love feels so good at first and then it starts to get funny and complex . '
I do n't know why that song got written but it 's definitely a real place inside of me . ''
