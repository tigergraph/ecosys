This is a track from Australian country artist Keith Urban 's seventh studio album , Get Closer .
A theme that loosely runs through the record is Urban 's connection to his wife , actress Nicole Kidman , to whom he 's been married since June 25 , 2006 .
Urban told The Boot how he came across this song : `` A friend of mine happened upon this song somewhere and called me up and said , `` You 've got to hear this song , you would swear that you wrote it . ''
And sure enough , it was uncanny how much it was suited to my life .
I think if I 'd written something like this , I would have felt it was too literal , not poetically disguised enough .
Maybe it 's because I did n't write it that I was able to hear how authentic and truthful it is . ''
The song is not to be confused with `` Without You , '' a track Urban recorded on his self-titled debut album in 1991 .
Urban reflects in this song on the importance of his relationship with Kidman , having for a long time previously been consumed by his job .
Despite its personal nature , the song was penned by two outside writers Dave Pahanish and Joe West , who also authored Toby Keith 's `` American Ride '' and Jimmy Wayne 's `` Do You Believe Me Now '' Producer Dann Huff told Billboard magazine the song is `` the most autobiographical thing that he 's never written . ''
Pahanish told The Boot about Blue Sky singer Emily West 's contribution towards getting this song cut : `` I put an early version of the demo on my album as kind of an extra before it was actually finished , '' he recalled .
`` Emily had a copy and gave it to Keith at a party they were at and told him this tune was his life .
Keith called me personally the next morning and said he wanted to record it for his album .
He put some finishing touches on it lyrically , recorded it , and now it really is climbing with a bullet . ''
