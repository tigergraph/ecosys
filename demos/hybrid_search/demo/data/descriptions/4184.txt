Ashley Monroe and Miranda Lambert wrote both this song and `` Beige , '' which appears on their debut album , Hell On Heels , the night they invited Angaleena Presley to join the Pistol Annies .
Lambert recalled to Billboard magazine : `` I was actually pouring a drink of Bacardi and turned around to Ashley and said , ` dear sobriety ! '
She 's like , ` what about it ? '
`` She continued : `` We were thinking ` where are these songs are gon na fit ? '
We had already been listening to -LSB- Presley 's -RSB- records .
Me and -LSB- Monroe -RSB- went campin ' in my Airstream all by ourselves , and we were like , we have got to do something with these songs .
` Dear Sobriety ' and ` Beige , ' they have to be sung by full on women women .
So we were like , ` hey , you wan na be in a girl band ? '
`` Monroe added : `` But we did n't put ` Dear Sobriety ' on our first record , and our manager was kept saying , ` that 's very special , you need to do this . '
Obviously , it stuck out to us , too , it was just a serious topic .
But as soon as it started laying down it was , ` oh my god . ' ''
