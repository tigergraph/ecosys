Guitarist Joe King penned this track during The Fray 's European tour for their eponymous sophomore album in Zurich .
He told the story of the song to Denver Westword : `` We had just gotten in .
This was during the second record tour .
I had n't been home for a good couple of months , and literally , I just got to my room - it was pouring outside , I 'd been in a plane all day , cooped up in plane , and I was tired , but I did n't want to just stay in the room .
Another cold hotel room with modern lamps and TVs mounted on the walls .
I was just so annoyed about where I was at , physically.So being in a beautiful city , I decided to go outside and walk in the rain , and so I just got outside , and pretty much , I felt like I was the only one out in the city .
It was probably eleven at night , I was walking through the alleyways and streets of Zurich , soaking wet .
I got back to the room and started writing .
I was missing home and missing feeling.I felt like I was dried up and so I kind of started messing around with this song .
I was also missing my honey at that time .
I was wanting her and could n't be with her and so there 's this element of desire in the song of this need that 's unmet that I can not meet and what that was doing to me .
So I just kind of captured that night with this one . ''
This is the only Scars & Stories track on which guitarist Joe King takes lead vocals .
Previous Fray songs that he sings lead include `` Heaven Forbid '' and `` Ungodly Hour . ''
