This is the closing track from American Metalcore band A Day to Remember 's fourth album , What Separates Me from You .
The album was recorded at Wade Studios in Ocala , Florida , from May to July 2010 and produced by Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory and Andrew Wade , who was also behind the boards on Homesick .
It peaked at # 11 on the US Billboard 200 .
McKinnon told Artist Direct that it felt right that this song should conclude the record .
He said : `` When we started putting the songs together and they actually became full songs , that seemed like a good ending .
It 's kind of negative , but it 's positive .
The song is happier-sounding .
To me , the whole record was a really dark place , to be honest with you .
Even the more poppy songs are darker .
` If I Leave ' is one of the songs that is n't at all .
It 's more of an upbeat , happy song , even though you 're talking about serious stuff .
To me , it was a breath of fresh air .
You 're coming out of it which is exactly what the future is going to be . ''
A Day to Remember singer Jeremy McKinnon explained the song 's meaning to Artist Direct : `` It 's all about different things you got through being on the road .
Things do n't always work out in your favor .
It talks about a relationship ending when you 're not really around enough to actually take care of it in person .
It 's about growing apart as time goes on . ''
