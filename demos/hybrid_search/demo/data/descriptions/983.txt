Toby Keith explained the original inspiration for this song written by him and Bobby Pinson on the press release for That Do n't Make Me a Bad Guy .
Said Keith : `` Bobby was having a beer with some friends .
He called me and said a girl came up to him and asked , ` Where are you from ? '
And he thought , ` In the time it would take me to tell you where I 've been , I could take you places you 've never been before . '
He did n't actually say it .
He started to , because Bobby talks that way .
Then he realized how it would sound , so he said , ` Honey , in the time it would take ... we 'd be here all night . '
It 's a just a very odd song , but that 's the kind of stuff I like to be involved in . ''
