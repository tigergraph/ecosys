Frehley wrote this after surviving a car crash in 1983 that almost killed him .
The song deals with his drinking addiction and the invincible feeling many rock stars get when they become famous .
-LRB- thanks , Cam - Cambridge , Canada -RRB- When asked in the same interview if he found it difficult to sing a tune in concert that deals with such a personal , traumatic experience , Frehley replied : `` The message of the song is an anti-drug song , about drinking and driving .
So I have no problem singing about it .
I 'm glad to sing about it because I 'm trying to give a message with this song so I feel really good about performing it . ''
Ace Frehley wrote this with Chip Taylor .
Among the other hits Chip Taylor has penned are `` Wild Thing '' and `` Angel Of The Morning . ''
Frehley explained to American Songwriter Magazine March/April 1988 how their collaboration worked : `` Chip wrote most of the lyrics and I wrote most of the music because I 've known Chip for years and he was aware of the incident that went down in the summer of '83 when I had the car accident and he thought it would be a great idea to write a song around it .
