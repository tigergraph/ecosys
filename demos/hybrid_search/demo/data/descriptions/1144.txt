Kian Egan of Westlife discussed this song , which was written by Scott Cutler and Anne Preven : `` This is a song that we all absolutely love .
It was one of them songs that kinda came out of nowhere .
We went to a studio in LA to meet these two song writers called Scott and Ann who did ` Listen ' for Beyonce and ` Torn ' for Natalie Imbruglia .
And they penned us two songs .
` The Difference ' just like kind of automatically like jumped at us .
When it gets to the second verse and there 's a thumbing beat that comes in underneath it , it just lifts you up straight away and it has that real kinda up lifting feel to it .
And then by the time it gets to the chorus it 's just this big massive song .
It almost feels like something you 'd hear U2 do in a sense with the drum feel on it .
You know , I 'm not comparing Westlife to U2 but it certainly has a bit of that kind of feel to it . ''
