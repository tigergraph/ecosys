This song was written around a cello sample and debuted by the band on Conan O'Brien 's talk show before they 'd even recorded it .
Said Guitarist/keyboardist Anand Wilder to Complex magazine : `` Yeah , we wanted to play something new rather than play a song off Odd Blood , and I think our record company was not too happy about that .
-LSB- Laughs . -RSB-
It does n't really help to sell albums to play a song that 's not on any albums .
But I do n't think -LSB- Conan -RSB- really cared .
It was kind of an honor for us to be playing a song on his show that no one had ever heard before .
It was totally exclusive .
Conan 's really cool . ''
Elliot Bergman , the frontman of the Michigan Afro-Beat band Nomo , stopped by to play kalimba on this track .
The kalimba , also known as the thumb piano , is an African musical instrument consisting of a wooden board to which metal tines of varying lengths are affixed .
It was also played on Vampire Weekend 's Contra track , `` Horchata , '' and was a favorite of Maurice White from Earth , Wind & Fire .
