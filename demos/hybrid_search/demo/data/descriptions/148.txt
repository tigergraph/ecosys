The 9513 asked Julianne Hough which was her favorite song on the album .
She replied : `` My Hallelujah Song really hits home because it talks about , ' I ca n't believe I finally made it here , ' and , ' I feel like I 'm right where I belong . '
And it 's the actual truth , because everybody 's helped me along the way , and I ca n't thank them enough .
This is really my dream .
And everybody has their hallelujah song , whether it be in work or just in life having a family or anything , it 's about you being in the right place right now in your life , and feeling like you 've worked so hard for it , and finally you 're getting there . ''
This was written by Music Row hitmakers Craig Wiseman and Steve McEwen -LRB- Just A Dream -RRB- .
Julianne Hough commented on her website regarding this up-tempo track , which is about being thankful for our most cherished moments .
Said Hough : `` I just feel like everybody needs a hallelujah song .
No matter what you 're doing in life - whether you are working at your dad 's company , playing soccer or being a little ballerina - that 's your hallelujah song .
It 's when you feel like you 're right where you 're supposed to be and I 'm happy right where I am . ''
