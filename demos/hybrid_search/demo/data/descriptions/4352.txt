The song is titled after the ancient pagan practice of killing a bull over a grated altar so that the blood poured onto a white-robed priest below .
It is basically a jazzy confessional with a syncopated chant of `` I ca n't keep myself from evil , '' and a finger-snapping rhythm that Banhart said was inspired by West Side Story .
