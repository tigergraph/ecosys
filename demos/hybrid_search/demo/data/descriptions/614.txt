This is the first single from Country music artist James Otto 's third studio album , Shake What God Gave Ya .
The song was written by Otto , along with Al Anderson and Carson Chamberlain .
This song was inspired by the shag music of South Carolina , which Otto listened to when he grew up .
He explained to The Boot : `` I did hear it some growing up .
My actual first real shag experience was from Alabama 's song , ` Shagging on the Boulevard . '
I heard that , and then I got more into shag music ... it 's a soulful sound , and it embodies that beach sound , and that 's what we wanted to do was to bring summer into your mind and really celebrate all the great things about summer .
It was a light-hearted , fun take on what makes a lot of summer songs as popular as they are .
People want to feel that wind-in-your-hair , top-down kind of thing that summer 's all about . ''
Otto explained the cut to his hometown station , Nashville 's WSM-FM : `` It celebrates all the things you love about summer .
It 's got that groovy , country-soul sound that really sets the tone for the whole record . ''
