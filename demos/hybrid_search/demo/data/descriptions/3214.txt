Themes of faith are evident throughout No Line on The Horizon , but especially on this hymn of praise .
This song of worship is arguably U2 's most up front Christian-based number since 1981 's `` Gloria . ''
This was at one time titled `` French Disco . ''
This song entered the Billboard Hot 100 at # 79 the same week as Rick Ross ' entirely different track `` Magnificent '' debuted at # 88 .
Two other instances of different songs with the same title debuting the same week were on the chart July 3 , 1976 , when both Fleetwood Mac -LRB- # 74 -RRB- and D.J. Rogers -LRB- # 100 -RRB- arrived with two entirely different songs titled `` Say You Love Me '' , and on Feb. 13 , 1993 , when Mary J. Blige -LRB- # 47 -RRB- and Mick Jagger # 84 -RRB- debuted simultaneously with songs titled `` Sweet Thing . ''
This song features additional keyboards by will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas .
Co-producer Daniel Lanois told the Canadian newspaper The National Post about his contribution to this song : `` That was born in Fez .
We wanted to have something euphoric and Bono came up with that little melody .
And he loved that melody , and stuck with it .
Almost like a fanfare .
And then I was involved in the lyrical process on that , because we wanted to talk about sacrifice that one makes for one 's medium or one 's art .
I thought it had for a setting New York in the '50s ; looking out a small bedroom window .
Maybe a Charlie Parker kind of figure .
That 's what we started with .
We placed ourselves in Charlie Parker 's body . ''
