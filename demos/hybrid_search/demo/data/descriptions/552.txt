The third single from Country act Thompson Square 's self-titled debut album , was written by the husband and wife couple with Jason Sellers and Paul Jenkins and released on May 9 , 2011 .
The retro-themed music video is a take-off on '70s variety shows with the Thompsons portraying hosts closely resembling Sonny & Cher .
`` When Keifer was writing the song , ' I Got You , ' it reminded us of the Sonny & Cher 's ' I Got You Babe , ' Shawna Thompson told Country Weekly .
`` We thought that if we ever got the chance to do a video on this song , it would be cool to do a sort of spoof on the whole variety-show thing . ''
Keifer Thompson added , `` We brought our video concept to Wes Edwards and he made sense of it all , plus he enhanced the idea a little further . ''
