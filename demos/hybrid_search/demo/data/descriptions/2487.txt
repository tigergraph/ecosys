Like the album 's lead single , `` Live Like We 're Dying '' this R&B - influenced pop song was written by the team of Steve Kipner -LRB- Christina Aquilera , David Archuleta -RRB- , Andrew Frampton -LRB- Kylie Minogue , Natasha Bedingfield -RRB- and two members of the Irish band The Script : Danny O'Donoghue and Mark Sheehan .
This is one of Kris ' wife Katy 's favorite songs on the album .
The song deals with the difficulties couples have communicating and the age-old Men Are From Mars , Women Are From Venus debate about the differences between the two sexes regarding discussing their emotions .
