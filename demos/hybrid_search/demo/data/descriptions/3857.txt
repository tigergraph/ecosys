Much of Girl Who Got Away was written and recorded before the summer of 2011 when Dido and her husband had their first child .
`` I wrote everything on this album before I got pregnant , ' she said .
`` And a lot of it was actually recorded while I was pregnant . ''
An unmistakable optimism shines through the record , which glows particularly brightly in the loved-up redemption of this folksy , autobiographical tune .
Though Dido considers this to be the most autobiographical song on Girl Who Got Away , the lyrics were actually written by her brother Rollo Armstrong , who is best known for being one of the founder members of the electronic group Faithless .
`` It just feels so relevant to me , '' she told Rolling Stone .
`` I think that 's the beauty of working with Rollo .
He 's the only other person who 's ever written lyrics for my stuff , 'cause it sort of feels like this extension of my brain ... I get really nicely surprised by his lyrics .
I might sing them one way at first , thinking they 're about this , and then suddenly it 'll become about something else . ''
