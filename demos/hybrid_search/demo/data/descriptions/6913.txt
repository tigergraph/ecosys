This hard-edged , anthemic song is the first single from Texan alternative rock band Blue October 's sixth studio album , Any Man in America .
The tune was made available for digital download on May 31 , 2011 and sent to radio on June 27 , 2011 .
Furstenfeld explained the meaning of the song title to AntiMusic : `` These are the chills that piss you off , because they 're more like feeling that you 're being controlled by another person .
This is the type of feeling that gives you these chills .
Yet you still keep falling for it , again and again and again .
And that falling for it perpetuates these chills .
They can be a good thing in a healthy relationship .
But in an unhealthy relationship when there is a child involved , those chills are not good news and never really go away .
Except now , those chills would come from my daughter looking at us both and saying ` Why ca n't we just all be together ? '
Those are the f -- kin ' chills I 'm talking about . ''
After the release of Blue October 's Approaching Normal , frontman Justin Furstenfeld found himself fighting a bitter custody battle over his daughter Blue Reed .
On one occasion , after not seeing his daughter for three months , the singer blacked out in an airport and had to be hospitalized .
Any Man in America chronicles these events .
He explained to Guitar World : `` It 's my last chance as a father to tell the world things I was n't able to tell when I was put through a custody battle that was so illegal because I was a man .
We live in the land of the free , but we 're screwed up when it comes to the rights of divorced fathers .
I 've got to tell the world what happened , who did it and what the judge 's and the cops ' names are .
I 'll probably get in trouble for it , but I do n't care .
I want my daughter to see that , while I might not have been there , I never walked out . ''
