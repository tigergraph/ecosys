When we interviewed Colbie Caillat in 2012 , she singled this out as the most difficult song she ever wrote . '' '
I Never Told You ' was a long work in progress , said the Malibu-based singer-songwriter .
`` I started it by myself when I was on tour in Germany .
Then two years later I played it for Jason Reeves and Kara DioGuardi when we were writing together in Hawaii for my album Breakthrough , and they helped me finish writing it that week .
It 's now one of my favorite songs ! ''
