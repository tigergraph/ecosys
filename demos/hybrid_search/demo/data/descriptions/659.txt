This song finds Bryan singing of a relationship that 's nearing its end but the narrator wants to spend one last night together with his lover .
`` Girl rest your head , one more time in my bed .
Love me like you loved me when you loved me and you did n't have to try .
Let 's lay down tonight .
And kiss tomorrow goodbye , '' he sings .
Chris Young 's 2011 hit `` Tomorrow '' has a similar theme .
Regarding the writing of the song , Bryan recalled : `` We got out on the road and had a great time and wrote a couple songs , and the last day , Jeff had this title , and we wrote it .
I mean , it 's a great idea and a great thought .
We wrote it right then .
I think the chorus of that thing is some of the best writing that I 've ever been a part of and I love the simplicity of the verses . ''
Bryan penned the song with his producer Jeff Stevens and Nashville songwriter Shane McAnally whose other credits include Lee Ann Womack 's `` Last Call '' , Kenny Chesney 's `` Somewhere With You '' and Jake Owen 's `` Alone With You '' .
The song was Bryan 's sixth # 1 single on the Hot Country Songs chart .
