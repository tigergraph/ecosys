AlunaGeorge are a duo comprising singer Aluna Francis and beatmaker George Reid , whose soul-influenced electronica has been dubbed `` Popstep . ''
Francis 's first venture into the music industry came when she sang in a group called My Toys Like Me , whilst Reid was previously a guitarist in indie-math rock band `` Colour '' .
They met in June 2009 , when Reid remixed My Toys Like Me 's track `` Sweetheart . ''
The accompanying music video was directed by Emil Nava and sees the pair focusing on the fairy tale element of the song .
We see AlunaGeorge put their urban spin on famous scenes from classic fantasy stories like Red Riding Hood , Rapunzel , Goldilocks and Sleeping Beauty .
This is the third single from AlunaGeorge 's debut album , Body Music .
It finds Francis calling out an ex for telling untrue tales about her .
`` Little grey fairy tales and little white lies , '' she sings , `` Everything you exhale is attracting flies . '' ''
-LSB- The songs -RSB- tend to be stories - stories people have told me that I can relate to , '' Francis told Billboard magazine of her lyrics .
`` Maybe the sentiment and the feelings can come from my experience .
But in context , the inspiration for those songs tends to come from elsewhere . ''
Francis told The Sun the story behind the song : `` A friend had told me a tale of woe , '' she said .
`` I did n't feel like there was a place for me to tell her to get rid of him .
So I came up with this metaphor when I was messing about on the piano .
The chorus came first and I imagined the rest of the story . ''
`` I want people to be able to listen to something through and enjoy the melody , '' Francis continued , `` then if there 's something about the lyrics that catches someone 's attention they can go back .
It 's a fun game to weave further meaning into lyrics that initially can come across as quite simple .
` Attracting Flies ' is quite immature in a sense but within those lyrics there are different layers . ''
