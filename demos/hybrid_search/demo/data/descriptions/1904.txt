This is one of the few songs Hendrix performed that was written by a member of his band .
Noel Redding , who played bass in The Jimi Hendrix Experience , came up with this with little help from Hendrix .
It was the first song recorded for Axis : Bold As Love .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- Redding did the lead vocals on this song .
-LRB- thanks , Steven - West Chester , PA -RRB-
