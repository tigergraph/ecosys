Electric Ladyland is the only Hendrix album to feature outside musicians , as Steve Winwood played the organ on the 15-minute slow blues jam `` Voodoo Chile '' -LRB- not to be confused with the album 's closer `` Voodoo Child -LRB- Slight Return -RRB- -RRB- .
A session man from New York named Mike Finnigan played organ on this track .
-LRB- thanks , Jim - Oxnard , CA -RRB-
