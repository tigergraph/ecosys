This uplifting track is all about having hope .
It assures listeners that things which may go wrong in their lives will be fixed in time , as reflected in the lyric : `` When the walls start falling on the world you have/Just hold tight , in no time , we can get it back . ''
Mutemath drummer , Darren King , told Absolute Punk that the song has religious undertones : `` We ca n't live bitter .
We have to admit there 's some good to the faith and church that we grew up with , even if some people hate that we say that .
Paul arrives at that conclusion with the song ` In No Time , ' which is a song he wrote completely on his own and which I love .
It 's probably one of my favorite statements that we got .
It balances perfectly that hope with the frustration that it 's not right yet still . ''
Mutemath front man , Paul Meany , added to the University of San Diego 's radio station that `` In No Time '' `` is certainly a special song for this band . ''
Darren King revealed in our interview that he tends to build up Mutemath tracks from samples he has collected overtime : `` On my own time , I 'll make very elaborate lengthy tracks , sometimes complete in and of themselves , other times just little 30-second , 1-minute ideas out of either samples , or I 'll make them out of recordings of stuff that we 've done .
Just our backlog of studio stuff .
I 'm always trying to collect sounds , and those electronic tracks will serve as starting places for our jams , so they 'll often give us at least a chord progression or a BPM and a key , so that we 're not just jamming in G. '' King added `` In No Time '' was one of the only tracks on Odd Soul to divert from this sample-based process , and was instead composed in the classic song writing sense : `` Paul sat down at the organ and did n't leave until he had all the chords and the lyrics and melody .
