George Strait sings this Mexican folk song completely in Spanish .
The Mariachi standard is played frequently on radio stations across Mexico and in Border States .
Strait said in publicity materials : `` I 've loved Mariachi music for years , and although I 'm not fluent in Spanish , I 've been trying to get better .
` El Rey ' has been a favorite song of mine for years , and I request it every chance I get .
So I decided to give it a shot .
What a blast that was .
I had a version by the great Vicente Fernandez .
I played it for the guys , and we worked it out .
I think it turned out great , and I hope the real Mariachis like it .
That will be the real test . ''
Mexican singer-songwriter José Alfredo Jiménez wrote the song and originally recorded it .
Jiménez was a constant presence on the music charts of Mexico from his 1950 breakthrough hit `` Yo , '' until his death from hepatitis in 1973 .
