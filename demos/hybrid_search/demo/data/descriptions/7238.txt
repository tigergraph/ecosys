Vocalist Max Bemis explained this song to Alternative Press : `` This song is another example of something I find inherently wrong with society and it comes from a different place .
I 'm a pretty spiritual and religious guy - not traditionally religious by any means - but very cerebral .
One of the things that is promoted in spiritually is this understanding of death being a kind of gate to another world and that life is n't the only thing that exists in the life of your soul .
Life on earth is only one part of it , but I think there are people who become obsessed with that notion .
I 've even been guilty of that at certain moments , but I 'm a pretty live-in-the-moment kind of guy .
Some people forget that life is important and their fascination with death or the idea that it will take you to a perfect place keeps them from living their life as if it 's their only life .
This song is about someone who drifts through this middle-of-the-road life and never really feels emotions strongly or is thankful for what they have because they 're so focused on the notion that they will eventually die .
They believe this life does n't matter because it 's all temporary , and I completely disagree with that .
I believe in the afterlife and that earth is only one perception that we will be experiencing for a certain amount of time , and that there 's more to it than that .
I think that you have to love it for what it is and treat it as the most important thing in the world . ''
