This was one of the first songs that Hot Chip 's Joe Goddard and Alexis Taylor wrote for the band 's fifth album , In Our Heads .
The song originated from a sample of a two-note flute melody , and Goddard told Pitchfork its main inspiration was James Holden 's remix of English electronic music artist Nathan Fake 's track `` The Sky Was Pink . ''
The dizzying eight-minute video features a continuously spinning camera as the band performs the song in their studio .
The song was the first one to be released from In Our Heads .
The band chose it as the first track to be made public as a left turn for listeners : `` I like it when bands come back with something that 's fresh and unusual , you know ?
, '' Goddard told Pitchfork .
`` It 's a more ambitious song than other things we 've done in the past .
I worked on it a lot to make sure it 's constantly developing in an unusual way .
I 'm pleased with how it turned out . ''
Guitarist Al Doyle explained the influence of `` The Sky Was Pink '' on this track to Spin magazine .
`` The chord progressions in that song I think were very influential because it takes ages for the chords to come around again , '' he said .
`` 25 measures or something for the whole sequence to begin again . ''
-LSB- Producer-DJ -RSB- Kris Wadsworth is not really a guy who does edits , but he 's a new sort of Detroit-y guy , '' he added .
`` He 's doing a sort of quite hard sounding , quite dark dance music .
` Flutes ' does n't sound particularly Detroit-y , but it 's got that sort of expansiveness to it that I think he 's doing really well at the moment . ''
