Edens Edge close their eponymous debut album with this a cappella song written by their longtime friend and former band mate Steve Smith .
`` It 's about living every day for the right thing , '' explained lead vocalist Hannah Blaylock .
`` It 's not about money , power or success .
It 's about who did I love today ?
Where are my priorities and where are my values ?
It 's a reminder of what 's really important in life . ''
`` It 's a really universal song , '' added co-guitarist and harmony vocalist Dean Berner .
`` It 's in a Christian context , but it speaks to people that are from different faith backgrounds and people who do n't really have a faith background .
It 's amazing in that way . ''
