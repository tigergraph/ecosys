Adrenaline Mob is a band formed by drummer Mike Portnoy after his departure from Dream Theater in early 2011 .
The other members that make up the quintet are Symphony X frontman Russell Allen , guitarist Mike Orlando -LRB- Sonic Stomp -RRB- , bassist Paul DiLeo and Stuck Mojo/Fozzy axeman Rich Ward .
This is a track from their self-titled and self-produced debut EP , which was released on August 9 , 2011 .
After the basic song was arranged Allen and Orlando worked on its lyrics and melodies .
Orlando explained to AntiMusic : `` The title was already there and was something I had from way back when . .
It was inspired by the movie American Pyscho actually where the main character seemed at times so sane and in control but then would just cut someone to pieces .
Russ and I then turned it more to the musical factor of it cutting you to the core with the power of the song . ''
The song started off as something Orlando tracked a number of years prior to the formation of Adrenaline Mob .
He told AntiMusic the story of the song : `` Our usual method of me bringing the recorded tracks over to Russells Chanty Shack and gettin to work on lyrics and melodies with Russ was again the norm here . .
Though on a break I added the release of the song where MP sings over & the section before the solo as a direct inspiration from Portnoy 's incredible playing style and saying to myself , this will be perfect for Mike and myself to really lean into this section and sync up together . ''
