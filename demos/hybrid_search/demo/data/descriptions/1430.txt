This track in 6/8 time features Marsha Ambrosius of the English R&B duo Floetry .
The song contains a sample of `` La Valse D'Amélie '' by French musician and composer Yann Tiersen .
from the soundtrack of the 2001 film , Amélie .
The troubled lyrics feature the sentiments of a girl who does n't feel like she lives up to her worth .
Wale states at the end with a spoken word segment , `` Her mind 's in the clouds , she writes it all in her diary . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Rik Cordero and shot in New York in and around Sputnik , a local bar and lounge in Brooklyn .
Cordero told MTV News : `` What he wanted to do was kind of show that we , as men , when we approach a girl , we do n't always know exactly what her past was .
Whether she was angry or felt a sort of way because another dude made a mistake that we have to pay for , that was the message Wale wanted to get across in this video . ''
