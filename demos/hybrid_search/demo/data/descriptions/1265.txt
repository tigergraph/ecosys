Like many other aspects of the Enterprise series , the choice of this song as the theme music became a point of controversy among longtime Star Trek devotees .
In 2003 , Watson 's version was remixed to coincide with the show 's rebranding as Star Trek : Enterprise .
Ironically , this livelier mix of the theme song came as the plot of the series itself took a darker turn .
