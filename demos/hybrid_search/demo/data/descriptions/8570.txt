The writer of this song is Zombies bassist Chris White , who recalled in Mojo magazine February 2008 how this dark and chilling war protest number came about : `` I 'd been reading AJP Taylor on the First World War and my uncle had died at Passchendaele .
I was driving to St Albans and working out that in the first morning there were 60,000 casualties in the Battle of The Somme .
The enormity hit me and I had to pull over to the side of the road because I was shaking .
That 's where that -LRB- lyric -RRB- came from . '
I just ca n't stop shaking . '
In the flat I had an old American pedal organ with the knee swells .
I wrote it on that , but Rod played it so much better in the studio . ''
There was a printer 's error with the title .
It was actually called `` Butcher 's Tale Somme 1916 '' but they printed it as `` Butcher 's Tale -LRB- Western Front 1914 -RRB- . ''
This was on top of another error on the album as the designer of the LP cover misspelt the word `` Odyssey '' as ' `` Odessey . ''
Despite being the album 's least commercial track , this was released as its first US single .
White admitted in the same interview : `` I was surprised .
I think it was the resonance of the Vietnam War . ''
Unsurprisingly the single flopped .
