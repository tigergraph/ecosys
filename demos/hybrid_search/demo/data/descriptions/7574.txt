Vocalist Alex Turner told NME that the band tried to work on this driving rocker with Elvis Costello 's drummer , Peter Thomas .
He added that the percussionist does n't appear on it , except in spirit .
`` If it had n't been for him , we 'd probably have binned that tune , '' he said , `` his enthusiasm was important for the journey . ''
Thomas did contribute drum work to another AM track , `` Mad Sounds . ''
