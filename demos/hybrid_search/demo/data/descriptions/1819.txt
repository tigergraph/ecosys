Vocalist Bethany Cosentino was in her early 20s when she penned the lyrics for Best Coast 's second album , Only Place .
She was in a self-conscious state following the success of the band 's debut set and realized she needed to mature .
`` I 'm trying really hard to grow up .
I 'm trying to let go of my bad habits and the immature things I still drag around with me , '' said Cosentino .
This song is about Cosentino 's fear of dying : `` I joke around that this is our emo album , but it is emotional , you know ?
, '' she told Q magazine .
`` There 's a song I wrote about speaking to my mum about my fear of dying .
I 've done a lot of growing up recently . ''
