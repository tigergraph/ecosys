The Scissor Sisters open their fourth album Magic Hour with this honky-tonk sing-along .
The band co-produced much of the record with German electronic music producer Alex Ridha , and frontman Jake Shears told The Sun he reveled in taking the DJ out of his comfort zone .
`` What excited me about working with Alex is that he makes f -- king banging hard techno so it was a big challenge for him to work on a song like ` Baby Come Home , ' '' he said .
`` And that 's what makes the record so special -- because it was really outside the box for him .
I would rather have that than go into the studio with Rick Rubin . ''
The song 's animated video was helmed by Lorenzo Fonda , who also co-directed the clip for the band 's previous single , `` Only The Horses . ''
Scissor Sisters penned this song about a lover who stays out far too late at night with American R&B singer-songwriter John Legend .
