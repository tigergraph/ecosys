This album opener is just Doherty , harmonica and some acoustic finger-picking from Blur 's Graham Coxon .
Doherty told The Sun March 13 , 2009 : `` That 's how I started out .
The mayhem came later .
The thing about all the chaos , the so-called rock and roll thing , is you can throw yourself headlong into it , into the night , into eternity .
It 's a childish fantasy thing .
You 're supposed to die and stay forever that age but most of us do n't .
Most of us actually have to come out the other side and lying there is still the old trusty harmonica . ''
Doherty explained the lyrical content to the NME March 21 , 2009 : `` I 'd been listening to an Edwardian musical that mentioned Arcady .
It 's still a dream of a place without infringement .
A place without oppression ... a place of creativity . ''
Arcady , or Arcadia is a central plateau in Greece .
Later writers idealized the life of shepherds there during ancient times .
