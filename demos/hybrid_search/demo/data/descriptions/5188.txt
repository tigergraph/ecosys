Home Again contains songs dating back a few years before the album was recorded and also more recently penned numbers .
This raw acoustic tune was the last one that Kiwanuka wrote for the record .
He told This is Fake DIY : `` I 've scrapped quite a lot of tracks and I 'd never put anything I was n't completely happy with on the album , whether it was a fresh one or a track from way back .
The album is full of songs that I think fit well together and I feel like this is definitely one of those . ''
