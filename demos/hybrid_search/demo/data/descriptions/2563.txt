Urban wrote this song with Rick Nowels , who previously co-penned two of Urban 's favorite songs `` You Get What You Give '' by The New Radicals and the Santana/Michelle Branch hit `` The Game of Love . ''
Urban told USA Today : `` He had sort of a Todd Rundgren , '70s vibe about him that I really loved and thought would suit my records well . ''
Urban told USA Today that `` the little B section before the chorus has an acoustic guitar thing that was very much inspired by the Fleetwood Mac song `` Hold Me . ''
He added that Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham `` is my favorite mad scientist . ''
Urban explained on Roughstock that Nowels had the music for this song , before he came up with the words .
He said : `` I did n't know what to write about and was going to ask someone else to help with the lyric .
Then I went to England and I started visualizing this guy sitting on the street corner seeing this girl walk by every day .
He loves this girl and wishes she would notice him .
You know sometimes love really is just standing right in front of you . ''
