This is the first radio single from contemporary Christian musician Bebo Norman 's seventh studio album , Ocean .
The track was co-written with Give Me Your Eyes singer Brandon Heath , based on conversations they 'd had over the years .
Norman explained in a statement that it is a song about trust , control and faith .
`` Each of us stands on the precipice of extremely difficult decisions many times over in our lives ... from the moment we first step into faith in Christ we are called to trust in something larger than ourselves , '' he said . ''
` Here Goes ' does nothing more than claim that scripture as truth and sing it out as a proclamation of the goodness of God as we stand on the edge of difficult decisions . ''
