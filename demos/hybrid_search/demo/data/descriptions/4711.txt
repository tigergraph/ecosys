This '70s - styled powerpop/glam-rager finds vocalist Jeff Tweedy singing of love and devotion .
He told Mojo magazine : `` It 's one of those songs that , as you listen to it , the heels on your shoes start growing and the bottom of your pants start to flare . ''
The Darren Romanelli-directed animated video finds the Wilco band members in cartoon form performing the song alongside Popeye , Olive Oyl , and co. .
The Chicago rockers previously appeared in a Popeye strip that appeared on January 22 , 2012 .
That cartoon shows Popeye and his crew helping Wilco in handing out cans of Wilco Spinach to the crowds on the dockside .
The song explores Tweedy 's long-lasting marriage to his wife Sue .
He told UK newspaper The Sun : `` I think an obsession with romantic love in a relationship causes a lot of pain.I think the only real hope for any relationship , in terms of longevity , is to maintain the ability to fall in love with each other and not get too distracted when it 's not too perfect .
Me and my wife have been together for 20 years and I think it 's pretty unrealistic to always be in love . ''
