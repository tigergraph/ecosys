Lead singer Eugene Hutz explained this track to Q magazine April 2008 : `` It 's the dissolving of the boundaries of science and religion , of daily life and transatlantic perception .
There are 108 elements in the universe .
Humans are made up of them , too .
When they are activated you experience life more fully .
You get Jimi Hendrix at Monterey .
Hendrix was a human with all 108 elements activated . ''
