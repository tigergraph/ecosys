This is a track from Country musician Blake Shelton 's second `` Six Pak '' , All About Tonight , a concept that he and his record label decided to experiment with in 2010 starting with Hillbilly Bone .
A `` Six Pak '' is a set of 6 songs released at a lower price than a full album .
It allows Shelton to release material more frequently .
Shelton told Billboard : `` They played it for me to get me to -LSB- do -RSB- the guitar/vocal for them and I made them promise not to give it to anybody else .
It 's called ` Suffocating . '
It 's a love-gone-wrong song . ''
The song was written by Shelton 's fiancee Miranda Lambert and Lady Antebellum 's Hillary Scott .
The pair penned the tune in the summer of 2009 while they were on tour with Kenny Chesney .
`` It was one of the many nights I hopped on her bus and we stayed up late just drinking wine and playing music and writing music , Scott told The Boot .
`` And I actually sang background vocals on Blake 's cut of that song , and I 'm looking forward to hearing it .
He sang the crap out of it from what I heard in the studio ... it 's a real passionate number . ''
Shelton recalled to The Boot : `` Miranda had been on the road with Lady Antebellum , and she flew out to one of my shows .
She said , ` I 'm excited .
I wrote this song , listen to it ... I think it 's a guy song . '
I listened to it and said , ` Do n't pitch it to anybody !
I wan na cut this thing , and lets bring in Hillary to do the harmony for the recording . '
So we did , and the only other voice on the track is Hillary singing harmony . ''
