This was the theme song to the 2006 TV show Number 1 Single , which was a reality show starring Lisa Loeb that ran on the E !
network in 2006 .
The show followed Loeb in her dating exploits ; she got advice along the way from various friends and relatives , including Juan Patino , who worked on her first album and is also her ex-boyfriend .
The title of the show is a reference to Loeb 's song `` Stay , '' which was a # 1 single in 1994 .
Lisa no longer qualifies for a reality dating show : In 2009 she married Roey Hershkovitz , a music supervisor for Late Night with Conan O'Brien .
Loeb wrote this specifically for the show with songwriter Jimmy Harry , who also wrote RuPaul 's dance hit `` Supermodel . ''
In our interview with Lisa Loeb , she explained : `` I was shooting the show and I left New York to come back to L.A. to write and record the song with Jimmy .
We tried to set it up so it was fun .
That 's another way that I write songs sometimes .
When I have to write for a TV show or a movie , or even if there 's something like a theme or something I want to write about , it 's like a little homework assignment .
The key in that song was to write a song that sounded like it could be a TV show theme song , but also an actual song-song .
A song that had the words `` single me out '' or something about being single .
And something about feeling about dating and relationships , set in New York City .
And those were some of the themes and issues that we had to hit when we were writing the song .
And I think that 's what we did pretty well .
We actually did it .
It 's something I just sang live , and it was fun to record and make it really rock . ''
