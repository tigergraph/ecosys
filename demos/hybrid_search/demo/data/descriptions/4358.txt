This powerful , unsentimental ballad is a track from Some Kind of Trouble , the third studio album from English singer-songwriter and soft rock musician James Blunt .
Blunt told Gibson.com why he 's especially proud of this tune from a songwriter 's point of view : `` Musically , I think it 's special .
I also like the sense of calm that emanates from the lyrics .
For me , the song reflects the fact that I 've made mistakes , and I have regrets , but that I take responsibility for those things .
` I 've made my bed / So I lie in it / No tears for me . ' ''
Blunt views this song as the album 's anchor , describing it in press materials as `` the summing up of a life . ''
He explained , `` there are certain songs along the way that are milestones that define a writer to themselves .
` No Tears ' is my milestone on this album . ''
