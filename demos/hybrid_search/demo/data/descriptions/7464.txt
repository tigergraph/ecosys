Canadian rock band Billy Talent close their fifth album with its title track .
`` If there 's anything that comes close to some sort of concept for this record , then it would be the underlying theme of this year being 2012 , with a little bit like an end-of-the-world-mentality seeping in there , '' explained Vocalist Ben Kowalewicz , `` and being aware that you only got one kick at the can , you only got one shot !
Dead Silence is about following your dreams , standing up for yourself , realizing what 's important and what 's total bulls -- t. '' Australian poster artist , Ken Taylor , created the artwork for the album .
`` The underwater scenario , a city immersed under the ocean , reflects songs like ` Dead Silence ' or ` Swallowed Up By The Ocean , ' '' explained Kowalewicz , `` but it also points out that there 's always an element of hope .
There 's the phone box , so when the world is destroyed and everything goes to s -- t , there 's still hope . ''
