Bowie 's ex-wife Angela claims this was written for her .
Bowie does appear to be addressing someone specific in this song , encouraging them to revel in their `` golden years '' : `` Do n't let me hear you say life 's taking you nowhere , angel , come get up my baby , look at that sky , life 's begun , nights are warm and the days are young . ''
Bowie performed this when he appeared on the TV show , Soul Train , in 1975 .
He was one of the first white singers to appear on the show .
Bowie reportedly got drunk beforehand to try and calm his nerves and the footage does appear to show him stumbling over his lyrics .
Station to Station saw Bowie adopt The Thin White Duke persona .
Dressed in a white shirt , black trousers and waistcoat , The Thin White Duke was described by Bowie as `` a nasty character indeed . ''
Throughout this period , Bowie was consuming a large amount of cocaine , which added to the alienated feel of the character .
Bowie wrote this with the intention of giving it to Elvis Presley , but he reportedly refused the song .
Elvis died two years later .
Producer , Harry Maslin , said he achieved the `` round '' quality of the backing voices by using an old RCA microphone .
