The track was composed by Paul `` Phamous '' Shelton along with Tiffany Fred , whose credits include `` Kleptomaniac '' by Joe Jonas and produced by Mick Shultz .
Zendaya told Radio Disney that the tune combines several types of music .
`` It 's one of those songs that 's creating its own lane or genre , '' she said .
`` I do n't think it 's pop , I do n't think it 's hip hop , I do n't think it 's R&B .
I do n't even know where you would consider it because it kind of mixes that pop sound beat with a very R&B kind of melody . ''
