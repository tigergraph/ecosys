This is the first single from Breakfast , the debut full-length album from alternative Hip-Hop duo Chiddy Bang .
The song features samples from the Swedish pop duo Icona Pop .
Chiddy explained the story behind the album title to Karmaloop.com : `` It 's symbolic because it 's our first official offering to the world -- our first meal of the day , so to speak .
And breakfast is such an important meal .
Plus , who can really hate on breakfast ?
You can eat it any time .
You ca n't really eat dinner or lunch in the morning , but you can eat breakfast all day . ''
Chidera `` Chiddy '' Anamege , who makes up one half of the duo , broke the world record for the longest freestyle on April 28 , 2011 .
His freestyle lasted 9 hours , 18 minutes , and 22 seconds , supported by looped beats played by Xaphoon , beating the previous longest time by three minutes .
The duo debuted this tune after successfully completing the record attempt .
Chiddy recalled to UK newspaper The Sun : `` Manners was a typical Chiddy Bang writing session .
Xaph had some stems from this Swedish group Icona Pop .
He chopped it into a beat I thought was dope so we recorded it . ''
