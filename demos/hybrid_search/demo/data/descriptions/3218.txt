Springsteen wrote this song about the death of Daniel Federici , his organ player and E-Street Band stalwart .
He explained to the Observer Music Monthly January 2009 : `` It started out as a way of making sense of his passing .
He was a part of that sound of the boardwalk the band grew up with and that 's something that 's going to be missing now . ''
Federici died on April 17 , 2008 having suffered for three years with Melanoma .
Danny Ferderci 's son , Jason , plays the accordion on this track .
