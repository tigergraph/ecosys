This is the title track from British soul and R&B singer Beverley Knight 's sixth studio album .
Knight co-wrote this with Guy Chambers -LRB- Robbie Williams -RRB- .
She explained : `` He had recorded a beautiful instrumental piece with his musicians , I heard it and converted it into a groove ballad . ''
Knight explained to Digital Spy why she titled the album 100 % : `` There 's a track on the album called ' 100 % ' that describes the commitment I have to my relationship .
But the bigger thing it describes is me , my attitude to my work and my music .
I give 100 % in everything I do because I have to .
Finally , I own this record 100 % .
It 's on my label and it 's 100 % me . ''
Knight explained on her website that this , `` is about my total commitment to my boyfriend , something I have n't always done if I 'm truthful , but this feels right .
100 % has also become the mantra for my commitment to my career - I always give 100 % of myself to music ! ''
The album was the first release on Beverley 's own record label , Hurricane records .
