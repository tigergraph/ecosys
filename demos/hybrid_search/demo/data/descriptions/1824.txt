This features Cat Power on backing vocals , who also features on the Modern Guilt track `` Walls . ''
Beck talked to Entertainment Weekly about working with the singer-songwriter : `` We brought her in , and she only had 45 minutes , but she 's one of those singers who just opens her mouth and there 's no work , no affectation . ''
Beck told the BBC 6 Music radio station that Danger Mouse originally was only planning on recording this song for him .
He explained : `` We were already friends , so I called him and said , ` Let 's do a record ' .
But he said , ` Well , I do n't have time so we 'll do one song . '
We did the first song on the album -LRB- ` Orphans ' -RRB- and then decided that there was a whole record there .
A couple of months later - we had a whole record . ''
Danger Mouse , who is best known for being one half of Gnarls Barkley , produced this song along with the rest of the album .
`` Orphans '' was recorded on the first day Danger Mouse and Beck met up for work .
Beck then went on to explain to BBC 6 Music how the duo worked together : '' -LSB- His -RSB- approach comes more from the hip-hop and electronic world , but I apply that to more traditional songwriting and rock and folk - and bring those elements into it .
He brought all the beats so that set the tone for the record .
These rhythms gave me the ideas for these songs and so that 's kinda how we came together . ''
