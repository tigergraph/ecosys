After spending nine months working in Berlin on an Electro record as the follow up to their debut album , the Ting Tings found themselves unsettled by their label 's excitement over its commercial prospects .
They scrapped six of the ten songs and moved to Spain in order to start afresh .
This is one of the four tracks that survived the cull .
The video was recorded in Manchester at the Salford Lads Club in July 2011 .
The song was performed live as the opening number on the Ting Tings ' European and Asian tour during the summer of 2011 .
