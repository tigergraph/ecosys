This aching anthem finds Karen O singing about wasted days and nights and tears stinging her eyes , before concluding , `` Nothing to fear . ''
It is one of the most melancholic tracks on Mosquito but drummer Brian Chase told Spin magazine he feels it reflects the album 's `` wise and peaceful sense of love . ''
He explained : `` Love has always been there in different forms .
In the form it takes on -LRB- YYY 's debut album -RRB- Fever to Tell , it 's very wild and passionate .
This one seems to be not quite omniscient , but can see situations from the other side , so there 's a peaceful sense to it , but at the same time , encouraging whatever it is to go through its process . ''
Karen O described this to The Sun as `` a love song to despair . ''
She added : `` It 's a feeling that you have that visits you time and time again .
It 's an incredibly uplifting song , though , about wanting to run away from certain darkness in your life .
`` It 's a reassurance , '' Karen O continued , `` and just what I needed when I was writing it .
It was like a nurturing and reassuring letter to myself and to anyone else going through something hard . ''
The Yeah Yeah Yeah 's debuted this on December 8 , 2013 when they headlined a Hurricane Sandy relief concert at Brooklyn 's Union Pool .
The song 's music video was directed by Patrick Daughters , who envisioned the clip as `` the end of an epic night out in New York City . ''
The visual was the first ever one to be shot at the top of New York City 's Empire State Building .
It was filmed early in the morning on the famous skyscraper 's observation deck , located on the 86th floor before it was open to the public .
`` It 's like the American dream for us , singing your song on top of the Empire State Building , '' Karen O told The New York Times .
`` It 's hard to do something like that and not feel like it 's symbolic ... Feeling like : man , where were we ten years ago , when we were sitting around in some punk-rock dive bar , thinking about what to name our band ... and now here we are at the top . ''
Other artists have tried to film at the Empire State Building , but their requests were denied .
Approving the filming of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs ' clip was `` not casual , '' according to Anthony E. Malkin , president of Malkin Holdings , operator of the landmark .
`` We did review the lyrics , we understood what the song was about , we understand the treatment , '' he said .
`` It had to be appropriate for the building , and it was . ''
