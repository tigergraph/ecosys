It was one of those records that I knew where it was going to go .
A lot of stuff reflects from the beginning , and it brings you all the way up to where I am with today , with all of the success and so on .
Before , I would talk about not having any money and living in the ghetto .
Now , I 'm in a different state .
I 'm a lot more fortunate and a lot more success .
I 'm a lot more paid . ''
