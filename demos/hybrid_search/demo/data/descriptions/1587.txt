The words `` Train in Vain '' are never sung .
The predominant lyric is `` Stand By Me , '' but that 's the title of a famous song by Ben E. King .
The title of The Clash song comes from the train rhythm in the song combined with the theme of being lost , as well as being a reference to Tammy Wynette 's 1975 hit single `` Stand By Your Man '' -LRB- `` you say you stand , by your man , tell me something , I do n't understand '' -RRB- .
According to NME magazine -LRB- 3/16/91 -RRB- , this is n't listed on the sleeve credits for London Calling because it was originally going to be a flexi give-away with NME magazine .
Unfortunately , the idea proved too expensive and the track went on the album instead .
-LRB- thanks , rainyhouse - Spanish Fork , UT -RRB- This was the first US Top 40 hit for The Clash .
They had only one more - `` Rock The Casbah '' in 1982 .
The song became a firm live favorite for the band , introduced to their live set in December 1979 and being played consistently after that until Mick Jones was fired in 1983 .
The music video is taken from one of these many live performances , a February 1980 show in Lewisham filmed by Don Letts and featuring an amusing introduction from Joe Strummer : `` We 'd like to take the soul train from platform one ... and if you do n't want to come , there 's always the toilet ! ''
On the original vinyl copy of the album `` Train Is Vain '' is n't listed on the tracklisting on the sleeve .
The story is that the song was recorded for an NME promotional flexi-disc once the London Calling sessions were done , and the flexi-disc idea then fell through , leaving the song with no home .
The band hastily tacked the song onto the end of the album just before vinyl pressing , but the sleeve had already been designed and there was no time to add it to the tracklisting .
The only clue of it 's existence is in the run-out groove on Side 4 , where the name is carved into the vinyl .
On all subsequent releases -LRB- including the CD copy -RRB- `` Train In Vain '' is included on the tracklisting on the sleeve .
Clash guitarist Mick Jones sang lead vocals on this song , and the lyrics appear to be a reference to the end of his on-off relationship with Viv Albertine -LRB- which he also referenced in `` I 'm Not Down '' -RRB- .
It also contains a pointed reference to his flat being burgled in early 1979 and his feelings of depression also referenced in `` I 'm Not Down '' -LRB- `` I need new clothes , I need somewhere to stay '' -RRB- .
The album cover was designed as a tribute to Elvis Presley 's first album .
The words `` London '' and `` Calling '' are displayed the same way `` Elvis '' and `` Presley '' were on his 1956 debut .
Instead of a photo of Elvis , however , the text frames a shot of Clash bass player Paul Simonon smashing his bass during a show at The Palladium in New York .
That bass is now in The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame .
You 'd think a big hit like `` Rock the Casbah '' or `` Should I Stay or Should I Go '' would be the most covered Clash song , but it 's actually `` Train in Vain . ''
Cover versions exist by Third Eye Blind , Ill Rapture , Dr. Haze/DJ X-Cel , The Sabrejets , Dwight Yoakam , Annie Lennox , The Manic Street Preachers , Jones Crusher and Kirsty MacColl .
