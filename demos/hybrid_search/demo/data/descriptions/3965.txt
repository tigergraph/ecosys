This Motown-flavored song has a simple message , Mariah Carey is not concerned about all the paraphernalia of Christmas - she just wants to be with her man .
In terms of airplay -LRB- at least in America -RRB- , this is by far the most successful Christmas song written after 1963 , when Bing Crosby recorded `` Do You Hear What I Hear ? . ''
The most popular holiday songs on American radio were all written between 1934-1963 , with `` Sleigh Ride '' -LRB- 1948 -RRB- , usually the most-played .
`` All I Want For Christmas Is You '' was not released as a commercial single , serving instead to drive sales of Mariah Carey 's Merry Chirstmas album .
On airplay , the song made # 12 US when it was first released .
It was re-released each of the next two years , making # 35 both times and establishing a place on holiday playlists .
In 1999 , it returned to the chart at # 83 .
In 2010 , the song found a new audience with a version by Big Time Rush -LRB- as `` All I Want For Christmas '' -RRB- made # 124 .
In 2011 , it nicked the charts with recordings by Justin Bieber & Mariah -LRB- # 86 -RRB- , Michael Bubl√© -LRB- # 99 -RRB- , and the Glee Cast -LRB- # 118 -RRB- .
There is one modern Christmas song that has beat this one for US chart position : Justin Bieber 's `` Mistletoe '' made # 11 in 2011 .
In the UK , the chart positions are even more impressive .
it was prevented from being the 1994 Christmas # 1 by `` Stay Another Day '' by East 17 .
Thanks to downloads -LRB- our friends in the UK tend to buy a lot of music around Christmas -RRB- , the song made # 4 in 2007 , # 12 in 2008 , # 18 in 2009 and # 22 in 2010 .
We ca n't declare it the most successful UK Christmas song of the modern era because `` Do They Know It 's Christmas ? ''
has made # 1 in some form three times since 1984 .
A cover by child star Olivia Olsen was used at the climax of the 2003 holiday feel-good film Love Actually .
Justin Bieber recorded a cover of this song for his 2011 Under the Mistletoe album .
He originally cut the song in a lower range , before Carey suggested that they record it as a duet , with the Canadian teen star reverting his vocals to her original key .
However , Bieber 's voice broke just before he hit the studio , which made it the hardest track on the album for him to record .
`` Yes , that was high , '' the Biebster told Billboard magazine .
`` But I grinded it out and we got it down .
`` The video for this duet shows Mariah in a skimpy Santa outfit showing off how well she recovered her form after having twins .
The clip , chock full of product placement , shows Beiber and Carey in a department store setting , although most of the shots have them appearing separately .
Carey is very particular about how she appears on screen , and if you look carefully , you 'll see that her shots have a different video treatment than Bieber 's .
Mariah prefers a look created by shooting at double speed and then slowing it down in post production , generating a nice film effect .
This means she has to sing at double speed , and also might explain why in the shots at the end , we do n't see Justin doing any `` singing . ''
Carey was married to Sony Music executive Tommy Mottola when this was released .
In his book Hitmaker , Mottola claims that she initially balked at doing a Christmas album , since she thought it would damage her Hip-Hop credibility .
When she saw the now-famous cover with her dressed in Santawear , she said : `` What are you trying to do , turn me into Connie Francis ? ''
This was co-written and co-produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff .
Afanasieff , who started off as Whitney Houston 's arranger has co-produced and co-written many of Carey 's hits including `` One Sweet Day '' and `` Hero . ''
He also won a 1999 Grammy award for co-producing Celene Dion 's `` My Heart Will Go On . ''
In December 2006 this became the first ringtone to achieve an RIAA gold certification for sales of over 500,000 .
English farmer Angus Wielkopolski discovered that goats produce more milk listening to this tune than any other song .
The discovery was made at St. Helen 's farm near York where staff listen to music while they milk the cows .
They found that the goats produced up to half a pint more when Carey 's famous Christmas track was played .
We hope they do n't play Herman 's Hermit 's `` No Milk Today '' for the goats !
In Japan , this became Carey 's first Japanese chart-topper , selling over a million units .
