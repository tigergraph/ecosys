This is a hidden track , which follows on from `` William 's Last Words '' at the end of the Journal For Plague Lovers album .
Bassist Nicky Wire explained to the NME May 16 , 2009 why they made this a secret track : `` We thought it was too grim , musically .
And also we wanted 13 tracks like The Holy Bible and we wanted a secret track like In Utero .
Just a petty rock 'n' roll thing . ''
-LRB- Journal For Plague Lovers producer Steve Albini previously helmed Nirvana 's In Utero -RRB- .
Like all the other tracks on Journal For Plague Lovers this was transcribed by the band from the last available musings of Richey Edwards before he disappeared .
This song and `` William 's Last Words '' were the only two written as pure prose .
Vocalist James Dean Bradfield told the NME that this `` was the only sound that we actually worried about from a listener 's perception of what we were trying to do .
Because that is the song that just came straight away from the lyric . ''
