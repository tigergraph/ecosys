The first single from Nerina Pallot 's fourth studio album , Year of the Wolf was written by the London born and Jersey reared singer-songwriter with Kylie Minogue in mind .
However the Australian singer had already recorded a song with the same title for her Aphrodite record , so Pallot decided to record it instead .
Pallot did land two of her other songs on Aphrodite , the title track and `` Better Than Today . ''
The singer-songwriter penned all three tunes with her husband , songwriter and keyboard player Andy Chatterley .
