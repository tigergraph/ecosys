This song is the group 's biggest crossover hit , reaching # 29 on the Billboard Top 100 .
The song does have a Christian message , but it is implied in the song rather than highlighted .
It 's memorable for its video , which features several people in a laundromat while a young man is being chased by two violent thugs , ultimately hiding in the laundromat .
It 's been speculated that the laundromat is a metaphor for church , because of the need of people to wash themselves of sin on a frequent basis , and that the fleeing young man is seeking refuge from his troubles , as people tend to do when they get in over their head .
