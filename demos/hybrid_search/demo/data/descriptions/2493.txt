Although this classic 1930s number started life in a musical , it rapidly became a jazz standard .
Written by Arthur Schwartz with lyrics by Howard Dietz , it saw the light of day in a moderately successful show , Revenge With Music .
The show opened in November 1934 and ran for less than two hundred performances , but `` You And The Night And The Music '' has been much more enduring .
Equally popular with both male and female vocalists as well as instrumental arrangements - including improvisations - perhaps the most well known recording is by Frank Sinatra with a big band sound .
