Moore explained this autobiographical song to Great American Country : `` It 's about where I grew up ; it 's just a little more hard core than ` Small Town U.S.A. . '
It 's a little more to the point , maybe , and everything in it is true . '
I was baptized in the Baptist church , my old man taught me about a hard day 's work .
I learned how to love and I learned how to fight . '
It talks about how I was looking for something , and my grandpa said , ` It 's in the drawer in the bedroom . '
I walked in , opened the door and there was $ 300 - $ 400 cash lying underneath a pistol .
That is just where he kept his pistol , by the bed , and he kept a little stash of cash there .
So that is the next line , ` We keep our cash in a dresser drawer underneath a .44 . '
It was real to me , and I found out it was real to other people as well . ''
