Stevens wrote this about a dachshund he found tied to a post when he was young .
When nobody claimed the dog , he took it home and grew attached to it .
According to the United States Humane Society , four million cats and dogs per year are put down because they can not find a home .
They recommend spaying and neutering to help control the breeding of more unwanted pets .
Among many celebrities who help get the message of humanity to animals out , long-running TV game show host Bob Barker made a pitch for this message at the end of most episodes of the Price is Right .
Producer Mike Hurst , who was a former member of the Folk-Pop group The Springfields , heard Stevens play this and had him record it .
Stevens got a record deal with Dream -LRB- an imprint of Decca designed as a showcase for British talent -RRB- and within 3 months this became a UK hit .
In 1976 , Stevens converted to Islam .
This happened after a near-death experience off the coast of Malibu , California , during which time he believes that he was spared to do God 's work .
After converting to Islam , he changed his name to Yusuf Islam .
He continues to answer to the title to this day , having started releasing Islamic gospel music in the 1990s .
The name change has a link to this song , because Stevens revealed that the tune was inspired by `` The Plum Blossom '' by jazz musician Yusef Lateef .
This was Stevens ' first single .
It became a hit on pirate radio stations in England , helping launch his career .
The B-side to this song , `` Portobello Road , '' is an actual street in west London , England , famous for it 's open-air flea-market .
It was also commemorated in the little-known 1971 Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks .
We 'd just like to point out the irony of a singer named Cat Stevens making this song .
