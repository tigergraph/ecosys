American Idol contestant Chris Medina released this single the day after the decision was made not to advance him into the top 24 of the competition .
The song is about his fiancée , Juliana , who suffered a brain injury as the result of a car wreck .
Medina 's back-story about his fiancée touched Jennifer Lopez , who had to be comforted by her fellow American Idol judges when the decision was made to eliminate him .
The two singers are connected as Jerkins also penned Lopez 's # 1 single , `` If You Had My Love . ''
The song proved especially popular in Scandinavia , remaining at # 1 in Norway for eleven weeks and in Sweden for eight weeks .
The song was written by writer/producer Rodney Jerkins .
`` I always knew who -LRB- he -RRB- was , but after doing some research , I did n't realize how ` the man ' he actually was , '' said Medina of learning that Jerkins wanted to collaborate .
`` The words totally embody what my situation is .
It 's heartfelt , it 's real and it was an honor to be asked to put my voice to this wonderful material . ''
Proceeds of the song 's sales were donated to a fund established for Medina 's brain-damaged fiancée .
