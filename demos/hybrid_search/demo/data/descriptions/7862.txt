Like `` Woodpecker '' , this uptempo number is an original Berry instrumental .
It was released in May 1964 as the B Side of the extremely well known `` No Particular Place To Go '' ; Chuck was never a fretboard wizard , so there is nothing here that would frighten Ritchie Blackmore , Eric Clapton or Edward Van Halen , although it is worth bearing in mind that but for Berry it is quite likely that none of them would ever have picked up a guitar in the first place .
