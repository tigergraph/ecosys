This is a song about working for the Salvation Army , commenting on how wasteful the rich are .
-LRB- thanks , Adam - Seattle , WA -RRB- Video game developer Harmonix created a cover version of `` Salvation '' for the Xbox 360 game Guitar Hero 2 .
The video for this song helped Rancid reach the mainstream .
When MTV began playing it in regular rotation in 1994 , their album Let 's Go gained notoriety and the group began to entertain offers from major labels - they were signed to the independent label Epitaph .
As a joke to see how far the labels would go to sign the band , Rancid convinced an A&R rep from Epic to shave his head into a blue Mohawk .
Madonna even sent the band nude pictures of herself in an attempt to lure them to her label Maverick .
This song appeared in the pilot episode of the teen TV series Buffy The Vampire Slayer , but the song did n't make it into the actual first aired episode of the show .
