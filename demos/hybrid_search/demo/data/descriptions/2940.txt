The song is based upon a direct vocal sample from American dance producer Matthew Dear 's 1999 track , `` Hands Up for Detroit . ''
Le Grand explained to 1Mix Radio why he borrowed that particular vocal , and why he loves Detroit as a city .
He said : `` It was a reference to the days of Detroit Techno , the producers and the sound that came out at that time were a big influence to me and it 's great to hear that sound coming out again lately .
I never knew the track would be so big .
I think you always know when you 've got a hit of sorts on your hands just from playing it out in clubs , and the reactions of people around you .
But I never expected in my wildest dreams that the track would go to the number 1 spot in so many charts around the world .
That was a very big point in my career for one , but one that I think I 've now built on from . ''
