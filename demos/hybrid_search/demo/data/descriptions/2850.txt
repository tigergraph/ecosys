Lead vocalist Ryan Clark -LRB- from Alternative Press -RRB- : `` The opening riff for this song is one of my all-time favorites for DH .
It 's almost equal parts metal , hardcore and hard rock .
This song as a whole is one of the simpler structures on the record , but I think that 's where it shines .
Sometimes it 's best not to overthink or overdo certain songs ... in many cases it seems the simpler songs tend to be the strongest - much the way ` LifeWar ' was on our last record . ''
