Chiddy Bang is a Hip Hop duo comprising Chiddy Anamege and Noah `` Xaphoon Jones '' Beresin , who met at Philadelphia 's Drexel University .
This is the opening track from Chiddy Bang : The Preview , which was released in early October 2010 .
The EP stood as a placeholder until their debut album was released .
Part of the hook finds Chiddy chanting the word `` swelly '' over and over again , and it 's a term the MC coined as a high schooler .
`` I made that word to replace the word ` swag , ' '' he explained .
`` The word ` swag ' is corny -- everybody says they got swag .
I was like , ` Yo , I got swell ! '
That transformed into ` swelly , ' meaning all things fresh , all things dope . ''
The song was co-produced and co-written by Pharrell Williams of the Neptunes .
`` It was surreal and crazy to grasp , '' said Chiddy of working with Pharrell .
`` Even when he walked in the studio , we were in a little bit of shock .
It 's crazy to put ourselves in that context .
No matter how much we accomplish , in our psyche , we 're still like kids that were making s -- t in a dorm .
`` Beresin added : `` He has an incredible energy , one of the most respected people who I grew up listening to .
No one else really brings the raw swagger that he does . ''
