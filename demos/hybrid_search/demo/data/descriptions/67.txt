Moore penned this song with his producer Jeremy Strover .
He told the Charlotte radio station WSOC : `` As everybody knows , I do n't do a whole lot of love songs but we tried .
They prodded me to do that on this album so we put a few on there .
I remember thinking where you potentially had fun with the opposite sex for the first time and it was the bed of a truck for me .
So , I wrote ` Bed of My Chevy . ' ''
