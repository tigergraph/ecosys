This song sees the Queens native Nicki Minaj rapping as her foul mouthed gay boy alter ego Roman Zolanski .
Minaj has claimed in interviews that Roman is her twin and she becomes him when angry .
The song was released to iTunes and to the radio on December 2 , 2011 .
The song and video finds Minaj as Roman Zolanski taking shots and spitting out insults all over Moscow .
Minaj explained to MTV News : `` Well , he was there -LSB- in Moscow -RSB- secretly because -LSB- alter ego -RSB- Martha wanted him to go there , so they put him in this thing with monks and nuns ; they were trying to rehabilitate him . ''
Roman Zolanski has been compared to Eminem 's alter ego Slim Shady , and on the song `` Roman 's Revenge , '' Minaj and Eminem trade bars as their second selves .
Other appearances by the potty-mouthed , nihilistic gay boy include on Trey Song 's `` Bottoms Up , '' Kanye West 's `` Monster '' and Minaj 's own `` Moment 4 Life . ''
The song was produced by Street Runner -LRB- Lil Wayne -RRB- and Raymond `` Sarom '' Diaz -LRB- Royce da 5 ' 9 '' -RRB- .
After their beat initially caught Minaj 's ear , it took about a moth for the production duo to tweak their instrumental to the Queens MC 's satisfaction .
`` Once we heard from Nicki 's camp that they were really interested in the track , we had to go back in on it and tailor make it a little more for her , '' StreetRunner told MTV News .
`` It took a good eight tries to get it into pocket , but once we got it , we knew it . ''
