Cheryl explained the meaning of this Taio Cruz written and produced tune to Pop Justice .
She said : `` You always hear about a woman having her heart broken on songs .
` Mechanics Of The Heart ' is about a guy who 's had his heart broken by a girl , and she 's saying to him , `` if you do n't believe that this is meant to be , how am I supposed to mend your heart ? ''
I think that 's quite a nice way of looking at something .
Rather than just saying , ` oh my heart 's so broken . ' ''
The song was originally penned for male R&B artist Loick Essien to sing , but Cheryl and Cruz flipped the lyrics introducing a female perspective .
