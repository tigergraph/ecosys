This was Paula Abdul 's first release since her 1995 album Head Over Heels .
In the ' 00s , Abdul became more famous for her role as a judge on the TV show American Idol than for being a Pop star .
Many American Idol viewers were too young to remember Abdul 's hit songs of the late '80s and early '90s , and this gave them a chance to see her perform .
Like much of her previous work , this is a light dance song .
Jackson , who had a long career as a studio bass player and record producer , is also a judge on American Idol .
This was the first single released on Randy Jackson 's Music Club , Vol .
1 , which also features performances by Mariah Carey , Joss Stone , Travis Tritt , Jason Mraz and former American Idol contestants Elliott Yamin and Katharine McPhee .
Jackson helped produce this track along with the Danish production team DEEKAY .
Jackson also appeared in the Super Bowl performance of this song .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France , for above 2 -RRB- This was Abdul 's first appearance on the Hot 100 since `` Crazy Cool '' peaked at # 58 in September 1995 .
The song debuted on January 18 , 2007 , on Ryan Seacrest 's radio show on KIIS-FM in Los Angeles .
Seacrest is the host of American Idol and served as a red carpet reporter in the hours leading up to the Super Bowl on February 3 , 2008 , where he interviewed Abdul after her pre-recorded performance of this song aired .
The Super Bowl was broadcast by Fox , which is the same network that airs American Idol .
Abdul 's collaboration with Jackson happened after several years of vague conversations about the two of them working together .
Abdul told Billboard magazine that during auditions for the show in San Diego , `` Randy kept saying to me , ` I 've got the perfect song for you .
It sounds like you , like now , it 's like a nod to you and your past , but it 's you now .
And he played it , and it was after the first two bars , I knew it was a hit .
I knew it was a total smash . ''
