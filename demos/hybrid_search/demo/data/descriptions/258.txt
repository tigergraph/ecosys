Moore wrote this song with his frequent collaborators Brian Dean Maher and Jeremy Stover .
This song was inspired by Moore 's experience of touring with Hank Williams Jr. .
He explained to Great American Country : `` We got off the road with Hank and Lynyrd Skynyrd and my producer , Jeremy , had just bought a house .
I went over to see his house and Brian , our other co-writer , just happened to be there .
I said , ` We 've got to write a song at some point about me going out with Hank Jr. .
It probably wo n't ever make a record because it would be so personal and nobody really probably cares , but we have to write a song about that . '
It was such a cool experience .
Our first show that we played on that tour was in Hershey , Pennsylvania , and that is in the song . '
A lot of things a country boy learns in life/how to shoot a gun and how to use a knife/But when I pulled into Hershey P-A , and I took my guitar up on the big stage/That night I did the best I could / Me and my band played pretty dern good / And I took myself out and sat in the crowd and learned how Bocephus shakes 'em down/You 've got to Hank it . ' ''
