This sexy fantasy romp featuring Young Money rapper Nicki Minaj is the second official single in the US from R&B singer-songwriter Usher 's sixth studio album , Raymond v. Raymond .
The song has raised some eyebrows with its lyrical content based around the thrill of finding threesomes in a club .
This party jam 's hook is based around a sample of Stevie Wonder 's 1973 hit , `` Living For The City . ''
When MTV News asked Usher if the lyrics about getting girls to bring him other females to engage in group sex was based on real life , he replied in the affirmative .
`` Yeah , '' he said .
`` I mean , I wrote about it .
It happens in this day and time .
Those are the best chicks to be friends with , honestly . ''
Polow Da Don , who produced the track , told MTV News : `` Usher 's in that same vibe he was in when he was 23 , 24 years old - with more knowledge .
We 're out kicking it , having fun ... bringing that energy back to the game , where you just see stars messing with other stars , making it exciting for the people .
That 's really where he 's at .
He 's like , ` C'mon , Polow . '
He 'll hit me up like , ` What are you doing ?
Let 's go out and kick it . ' ''
Nicki Minaj also appears in the song 's music video .
She told MTV News : `` The video is freaky .
And it 's a great concept , a great story line .
It felt just like one of the sequels to Saw .
It was dope . ''
Minaj 's rap on this track added to the speculation in the press that she is bisexual .
She told Complex Magazine concerning the rumors : `` When I rap , it 's just an extension of how I speak , and that 's how I talk .
If you do n't like it , do n't listen .
I 'm also not going to explain something just because I said it in a rap .
Take what you want from it .
-LSB- In the press -RSB- I did n't say -LSB- I do n't like women -RSB- .
I said I do n't have sex with women .
I do n't have sex with men right now either .
If -LSB- bisexual is -RSB- what they wan na call me , then fine . ''
