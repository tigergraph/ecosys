Foreman , who is the lead singer of Switchfoot , wrote this song about Jesus and his death on the cross , but from the perspective of one of the thieves that died with Him .
-LRB- thanks , Alfredo - Cranston , RI -RRB- Speaking to us about how his persona changes depending on his musical project , Foreman said , `` For better , for worse , that 's all I 've got to offer is me .
I 've got nothing else .
And I think there are other sides to myself - everyone has multiple layers - but I 've been fortunate to have Fiction Family and the solo projects and the work with Switchfoot to be able to express myself in plenty of ways .
So I 've never felt the need to wear a mask . ''
