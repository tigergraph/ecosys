Basement Jaxx are an UK house dance/electronic duo consisting of Felix Buxton and Simon Ratcliffe .
This is a track from their 5th studio album , Scars .
This electro-laden floor-filler is a collaboration with Florida-based , female hip-hop duo Yo Majesty .
However when laying down this track , the UK duo got more than they bargained for .
Buxton smiled to The Daily Mirror April 24 , 2009 : `` I 've never been with a singer when they pull off their top during a vocal session .
That was really full on .
You 're in this little room and there 's a bare-breasted woman screaming in front of you .
Apparently it 's something they do in their live show .
I was n't aware of it , so it was quite a shock .
But they were very cool , good-hearted people . ''
This features lyrics adapted from Michael Sembello 's song `` Maniac . ''
