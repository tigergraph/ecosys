Speaking in a track-by-track video posted by the band , vocalist Cedric-Bixler Zavala discussed this song : `` It 's a title I 've had for a long time 'cause I got it from a book , '' he said .
`` I know a book had it in the title and it just sort of stuck with me .
And I thought ` Oh , rock 'n' roll , we all sample each other 's ideas .
Like Hip-Hop in the '90s .
Which is why our T-shirts are the way they are ... ''
