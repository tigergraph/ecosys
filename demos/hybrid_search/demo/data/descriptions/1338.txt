Durbin co-wrote this song with seventh season American Idol champ David Cook , songwriter Gregg Wattenberg -LRB- O.A.R. 's `` Shattered -LRB- Turn The Car Around -RRB- '' and Rock Star : Supernova contestant Ryan Star .
Speaking with Alternative Addiction , Durbin recalled the writing of the track : `` It was a very fun song to write .
I was in Manhattan and I get to the Wind-Up studio called Rewind Studios , '' he said .
`` I get up there and I knew I was doing a writing session and David Cook ended up being there .
I did n't know I was writing with him even though I 'd talked to him before and hung out with him a little bit .
And then Ryan Star and meeting him was cool .
He 's a really great singer and a really great musician .
And Gregg Wattenberg showed up - he 's a great writer and he does A&R for Wind-Up Records , one of the top guys there .
It was a lot of fun .
I had some lyrics that I 'd written for an idea that had a very bullying feel to it and it was called ` Scream ' and we got ` Screaming ' from it .
It was a very fun song to write . ''
Durbin explained the song 's meaning : `` The funny thing about ` Screaming ' is that people might think because I was on Idol and I was the screamer that it 's just a bunch of painkiller high notes , but it really is n't .
It 's about being bullied , it 's about being picked on and revolting for it , saying ` I 'm screaming for my losers and we 're screaming at the abusers and we 're showing them that we 're fed up . '
It 's like the fist in the air - we 're all joining hand-in-hand to fight the battle , but to fight it with our hearts , not with fists . ''
