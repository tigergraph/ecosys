You Me At Six were forced to revise this song after hearing the Foo Fighters ' Wasting Light album .
Vocalist Josh Franceschi explained to Kerrang !
magazine : `` There 's a Foo Fighters song on their new album and originally , accidentally , this had the same chord progression and same effect on it .
When we heard the Foo Fighters ' track , we went , ` Oh f -- k , ' and just left it .
Then Max -LRB- Helyer , guitar -RRB- started messing around and came up with a different way of playing it . ''
Not only did the band have to revise the chord progression , but they had to change the song title - twice .
The tune was initially called ` Do n't Hold Your Breath , ' but Nicole Scherzinger also had a song with that name .
So YMAS re-titled it `` The Best You 've Never Had , '' until it clashed with Beyonc√© 's `` Best Thing I Never Had .
Eventually , they settled on `` Reckless . ''
