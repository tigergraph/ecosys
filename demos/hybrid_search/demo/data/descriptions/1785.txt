This is probably the best example of Skynyrd guitarist Steve Gaines ' contributions to the band .
He wrote the song himself , and also wrote or co-wrote 3 other songs on the album .
Gaines replaced Ed King as the band 's guitarist in 1976 , but died in the 1977 plane crash that also claimed the lives of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant and Gaines ' sister Cassie , who was a backup singer for the group .
This song provides a glimpse of his clever songwriting , as Van Zant sings about a guy who has a strong feeling that his girl is cheating on him .
Skynyrd guitarist Gary Rossington told Guitar School magazine , July 1993 , that he 'd never heard anybody , including the current guitarists in the band , play the picking on this song quite right - the way Steve Gaines did .
