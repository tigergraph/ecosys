Vocalist and guitarist Tom Fletcher told the Mail On Sunday July 20 , 2008 about this song : `` This number is about a messed-up relationship , where neither partner is right for each other but both of them realize that it 's the bad stuff they love .
Is breaking up really what they want , when doing what they know is wrong feels so good ? ''
Danny Jones , lead guitarist , used a kazoo to produce the high pitched noise during the chorus , as shown in their DVD , Down Under With McFly .
