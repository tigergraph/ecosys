Liz , the sister of Eel 's mainman Mark Everett , spent several years in and out of rehab and mental institutions before committing suicide in 1996 .
This song referred to one of her mental hospital stays when the doctors told her to write , `` I am OK '' a hundred times .
Everett recorded this album during a bleak time in his life .
He had lost his only spouse and his mother was dying of lung cancer , so it was probably to be expected that much of the album deals with death and loss .
After his mother passed away in 1998 Everett was left as the sole surviving member of his family -LRB- his father died of a heart attack in 1982 -RRB- .
The tragedies did n't end there as one of his cousins , Jennifer , was a stewardess on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11 .
This was one of several tracks on the Electro-Shock Blues album where Everett reflected back on his sister .
He told Q magazine -LRB- February 2008 -RRB- that it was his way of giving Liz , who was always his biggest fan , a creative outlet : `` It 's like , here 's the gift I can give her .
It 's too bad she could n't do this for herself but I 'm going to let her be an artist here .
It 's like putting a frame around her . ''
