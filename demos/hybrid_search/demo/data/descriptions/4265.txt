This is the title track from Until We Have Faces , the third album by Christian rock band Red .
The song was released to radio on December 31 , 2010 as the first single from the album .
Armstrong expanded on the song to NewReleaseTuesday : `` It 's basically the keystone of the whole record , the embodiment of what the whole record will be about finding identity .
I think that this song is more about realization ; you wake up one day and you find yourself be something that you never wanted to be .
You find that the world has kind of gotten itself in your head and turned you into something that you were never really meant to be .
This song is kind of about a person screaming out with that realization , I 'm hollow and faceless .
I need to do something about this . ''
Guitarist Anthony Armstrong explained the song 's meaning to AntiMusic : `` When we finally realize we have let the world define us , we know that we are hollow .
We only substantiate our very own apathy when we continue to not do anything about it .
This song leaves us with an internal challenge .
We discover that we are faceless , and it may be time for an alteration . ''
