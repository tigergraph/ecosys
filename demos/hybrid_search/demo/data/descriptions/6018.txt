This song came out of a conversation Nash had with her boyfriend , The Cribs singer Ryan Jarman .
She explained to Spinner UK : `` Early Christmas Present , is about someone I know being cheated on .
I was talking with Ryan about this guy I knew that had cheated on his girlfriend , and it dawned on us that it was pretty messed up for us to know about it but for her not to .
The song 's about how it 's always the person who should know first that finds out last . ''
Nash explained to The NME that it was titled `` Early Christmas Present , '' `` because he slept around and ended up giving the girl something like an STD . ''
