This plaintive song was inspired by the 1950s nuclear testing parties , where crowds watched above-ground nuclear tests in the Nevada desert through sunglasses .
There was even a beauty pageant , which lead to the iconic photograph of the winning ` Miss Atomic Bomb ' clad in a mushroom cloud-shaped bathing suit .
Flowers revealed to UK newspaper The Sun that this song was originally rejected by one of the album 's producers .
`` For a while , it got dismissed by one particular producer - I 'll leave him unnamed but the demo was shut away for three months , '' he explained .
`` Yes , we took that personally , and one day I was at home on the computer going through some demos , came across it again and thought : ` WHAT are we doing ?
It could even be a single and be brought to life on film . '
So we resurrected it . ''
A second part-animated video was released telling a fantastical love story .
It features Eric Roberts and Izabella Miko reprising their roles in `` Mr Brightside '' as part of a love triangle with Brandon Flowers .
Brandon Flowers told the backstory of the song to NME : `` It 's a beautiful picture of this woman in the desert .
I think she 's still alive .
I met Bernie Taupin for the first time and I felt like he was giving me a little bit of advice .
He did n't say much to me , just asked , ` Do you like titles ? '
And I started thinking about Elton John songs , and found out Bernie wrote the titles first .
Like ` Mona Lisa and Mat Hatters , ' or ` Candle in the Wind , ' it 's already epic .
`` Flowers had the phrase ` Miss Atomic Bomb ' rattling in his brain , and he decided to tie the song into `` Mr. Brightside '' revisiting the characters of the Hot Fuss classic .
This , he told NME , made it `` very easy for me to write . ' ''
The song 's music video was shot on the band 's 2012 UK festival and arena tour .
