This song is about a book called The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky .
The book 's main character , named Charlie , is dating a girl named Mary Elizabeth who has a lot of tattoos and piercings .
Charlie has a way of telling people how he feels about them by making them a mix tape , usually with songs by The Smiths , who are his favorite band .
