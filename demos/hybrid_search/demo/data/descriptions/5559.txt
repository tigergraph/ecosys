This song was inspired by the English lawyer , Sir Frank Crisp -LRB- 1843-1919 -RRB- , who was the original owner of Friar Park , which Harrison purchased in 1970 .
A keen horticulturist , he developed spectacular public gardens in his mansion 's grounds .
Harrison 's 1976 song `` Crackerbox Palace , '' was also inspired by Friar Park .
Harrison 's widow , Olivia , recalled to The Sun June 12 , 2009 : `` I love that song .
George was a young man - aged 27 - when he bought it .
The garden was derelict and overgrown .
It would take a rare person to look at that and say , `` This is great . ''
But he just set about restoring it .
It 's really a beautiful , beautiful place and it was just about doing it for the love of it . ''
The Friar Park estate has caves , an underground lake , and many more eccentricities that fascinated Harrison , who lived there until his death .
The album cover is a photo of Harrison at Friar Park surrounded by some of his garden gnomes .
The lyrics are derived from phrases inscribed around the grounds at Friar Park .
The song has been described as a love song to the house made with its own words .
