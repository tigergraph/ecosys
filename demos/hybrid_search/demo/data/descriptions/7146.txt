From 2002-2005 , the Osbourne family had a reality show on MTV called The Osbournes , which followed the domestic adventures of Ozzy , Sharon , Kelly and Jack .
Watching Ozzy in grumpy old man mode proved irresistible to viewers , as we saw him struggle with the typical challenges of running a household -LRB- or at least living in one run by his wife -RRB- while he also dealt with more unconventional problems , like his daughter dating a Rock Star -LRB- Bert McCracken of The Used -RRB- .
Seether needed a title for this song , and inspiration struck when they were watching Ozzy attempt a more commonplace task on the show .
The band 's frontman Shaun Morgan told us : `` Ozzy was running around mumbling about spicy burritos .
And it was one of those moments where it was like , this is a legendary man , but it 's a different side of him .
It seemed real vulnerable and real personal .
So we just picked it because it was a tongue-in-cheek homage to Ozzy Osbourne .
`` Seether are big fans of Ozzy , but despite playing at Ozzfest in 2002 , have never met the man .
The song has nothing to do with burritos , which are not mentioned in the lyrics .
It 's really about dealing with a person who hurt you , and moving on from that relationship .
Shaun Morgan had been dating Amy Lee of Evanescence .
The band started writing this for the soundtrack of the 2003 movie Daredevil , but their song `` Hang On '' was used instead .
