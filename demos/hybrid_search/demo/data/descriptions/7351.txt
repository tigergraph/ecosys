This is the title track from the ninth studio album -LRB- eleventh total -RRB- by American alternative country band Drive-By Truckers .
The album was recorded over three blocks of sessions , which the band decided to split between their 2010 release The Big To-Do and Go-Go Boots .
`` We recorded nearly 40 songs last year and into this year and fairly early on divided it into two separate albums '' explained DBT co-founder Patterson Hood .
`` The Big To-Do , released first , was the more straight forward ` Rock ' album .
Go-Go Boots is what I sometimes -LRB- semi-jokingly -RRB- refer to as our country , soul , and murder ballad album .
Those elements definitely play into it , but it 's a little more open ended than that . ''
`` Go-Go Boots '' and `` The Fireplace Poker '' are a pair of related songs about a two-faced preacher who pays the price for having his wife killed .
The songs are based on an idea Hood had for a film .
`` I 'm a frustrated filmmaker when it really comes down to it , '' said Patterson Hood to Chris Talbott of The Associated Press .
`` If you look at our albums as movies without the movie , they actually make more sense than they do as albums .
That did n't dawn on me till just about two albums or so ago -- ` Wow , that 's what 's wrong with this picture . ' ''
