The theme of this album is growing old .
The concept took shape when singer Craig Finn saw Opening Night , a 1977 John Cassavetes film about a mature screen siren .
This song takes its lyrics directly from the film 's plot .
Finn told Q magazine July 2008 : `` The movie just killed me .
It summed up everything I was trying to say about how we let people see what we want them to see , the constant projection we make . ''
This song references Ybor City , a party district in Tampa , Florida that has been name-checked in several other Hold Steady albums .
Finn expanded on Opening Night in an interview with Uncut magazine August 2008 : `` I 'm not someone who 's emotionally moved by much film , but I got this Cassavetes box set and I was surprised by the impact his films had on me .
With Opening Night , I was very drawn to this idea of the aging actress .
I mean , if you 're trading on your beauty , the aging process is really your enemy .
And Opening Night has that as a really tragic thing , her simply getting older .
I was also really taken by the scene where Cassavetes wants to slap Gena Rowlands , and he says , ` If I do n't really slap you , it wo n't look real for the performance . '
And she says ` It 's a play , why would you have to actually slap me , that 's the whole point . '
That kinda connected with the way I think people are preoccupied with my relationship with the characters I write about .
I 've always said no one really cares whether Quentin Tarantino kills people or does karate but for a songwriter there 's this question of a perceived honesty , that your songs are the story of your life . ''
