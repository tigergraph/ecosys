Thousand Foot Krutch frontman Trevor McNevan -LRB- from NewReleaseTuesday -RRB- : `` This song is about coming up , about every person who doubted , every time you had to put your head up , grin and bear it , when no one else believed .
It 's about being driven , following your passions and calling , and not taking ` no ' for an answer .
I give God all the glory for what we 've endured .
If you do the possible , He will take care of the impossible . ''
