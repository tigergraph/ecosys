This is the title track from Barbadian R&B singer Shontelle 's second album .
She explained the album title to Digital Spy : `` Any artist will tell you about the struggles and ups and downs of trying to break through .
I feel like I 've passed the first album test , I have fans in different parts of the world , and now I have to gel it all together and make it blossom into something much bigger .
I feel like , ` OK , you 've got to have nothing in your way .
There 's going to be no gravity and you 're just going to keep floating higher and higher ' . '
It 's a mantra that I wanted to adapt to the entire project . ''
Shontelle told MusicRemedy.com the story behind this song : `` Its like a cute love song really .
I was literally just thinking about what you feel like when you have that love - it just makes you so happy and excited and you really do feel like you 're walking on thin air in a bubble and singing ` la la la. ' That 's literally what it is you 're just happy to be in love .
And so you feel like there 's no gravity , you 're just floating through space . ''
