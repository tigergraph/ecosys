Busta explained this song to HipHop.com : `` That 's another one o ' those feel-good , enjoy yourself , have-a-good-time records .
My grandmother always used to tell me to shoot for the moon and that way even if I miss I 'd land on the stars - do s -- t that exceeds my expectations so I 'll accomplish my own .
I always liked that saying .
That 's why I 'd always do s -- t to make me stand out .
That 's why I said `` Rarr rarr ! ''
on the record with Tribe : it was like , ` OK then - out-do that ! ' ''
