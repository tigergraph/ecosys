This track features Avenged Sevenfold vocalist M Shadows .
Slash told Musicradar.com how he ended up hooking up with the hard rock singer : `` There was n't a lot of conscious thought about what kind of record I was making .
I was just pooling all of these people together and it was a devil-may-care kind of thing , but once I started to look at the list of people I 'd already worked with , sort of halfway through the record , I had some of my heroes on there , some of my contemporaries and I wanted to have some young guys .
For this song I was thinking that Dave Mustaine would 've been great , but I did n't want to spin way too much into any one era .
Then I thought of Avenged Sevenfold , and fortunately we share the same management so M Shadows was easy to contact !
And he was great , he came in and worked really hard to get the melodies together , he took it very seriously .
It 's me getting away with something I could n't do in Velvet Revolver ! ''
M Shadows recalled to Billboard magazine : `` Before we met he sent over a verse riff and a chorus and basically said , ` What can you do with this ? '
At first I was just doing some vocal melodies , but after a while I was like , ' I kind of want to make this a little more in-depth , ' so I brought in a new verse and turned the chorus into a pre-chorus .
Slash was super laid-back .
He was n't pissed that I was coming up with new things . ''
