Of Montreal 's eleventh album , Paralytic Stalks was recorded by mainman Kevin Barnes in his own Sunlandic Studios .
This song features a surging orchestral cacophony , one of a number of tracks that reflect the inspiration of works by such difficult 20th century classical composers as Harry Partch , Charles Ives and Krzysztof Penderecki .
`` On many songs on the album , I eschewed the template of conventional pop music while experimenting with microtonality , surrealism and through-composed arrangements , '' Barnes explained to NME .
`` Musically , I wanted to create something highly emotive and intimate , something that expressed all of the confusion , suffering , madness and longing inside of me.Lyrically , I wanted to use a very raw and direct style , influenced by Henry Miller , Bukowski , Celine , Selby , '' he added .
`` I hope that people connect with this album , and that it helps others like me to feel less troubled and less alone . ''
