When Hayley Williams began writing lyrics for the songs that appear on Paramore 's first release as a three-piece following the departure of the Farro brothers , she found herself feeling more optimistic about the future of the band .
`` I had this kind of Tony-in-West-Side-Story-moment when he sings about how something is coming , '' she said .
`` He does n't know what it is , but it 's going to be great , '' she says with a laugh .
`` A lot of the new songs came out of that .
They 're about needing to find whatever 's next .
`` This mid tempo ballad about wishing to build a world that matches the ones constructed in fantasies is one of the fruits of her positive outlook .
The song 's music video combines black and white shots of Paramore playing London 's Wembley Stadium during their UK headline tour with the story of two girls who pack their bags and head to London to see the band .
Paramore originally tweeted about writing this song in a hotel room in LA back in February 2013 .
