Jon Foreman is the lead singer and lyricist for Switchfoot , and in this song he examines his place in the world alongside nature .
When we spoke with Jon in 2011 , he said : '' ` Restless ' was inspired over in the UK .
I was listening to the rain and watching these individual drops drip down the window and thinking that every one of them is in pursuit of the ocean , that they will stop at nothing , and gravity will eventually one day lead them to the ocean .
And I began to think of my own life and wondering if I had that same drive , that same pursuit for that which is right and true .
And then I was thinking through C.S. Lewis ' idea that this life , when we 're aware of beauty , it 's kind of a bittersweet thing , that it 's a transient reminder of eternal beauty , which someday we will be face to face with . ''
