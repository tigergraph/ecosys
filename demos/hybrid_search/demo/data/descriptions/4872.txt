Grand Duchy are a husband and wife duo comprising of one-time Pixies singer Frank Black and Violet Clark .
Clark explained to The Sun February 20 , 2009 the idea behind the duo 's name : `` A grand duchy is a principality overseen by a Duke or a Duchess .
We find the idea of inhabiting a realm of one 's own appealing .
We like the idea of making up one 's own rules . ''
Black and Clark played all the instruments themselves on Petit Fours except for a `` bail-out '' on the bass for this song .
Clark told The Sun that playing all the instruments themselves was `` really empowering and fun - and , at times , a complete disaster -LRB- hence , the bass ` bail out ' credit -RRB- . ''
