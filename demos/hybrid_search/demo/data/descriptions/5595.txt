In our interview with Shaun Morgan , the Seether frontman explained : `` Religion is not something that I talk about or that I care for people to know where I stand .
In '69 Tea ' there 's a line that says , ` Save me smiling Jesus , get off that cross , ' and that was overwhelmingly sarcastic .
I wrote that when I was 16 .
It was something that was just there in front of me and that 's the way I wanted to say it . ''
This song challenges Jesus to `` get off that cross '' and actually `` save me . ''
It evokes a feeling of disbelief in religion and says that you should help yourself , because `` who else will ? ''
The lines , `` Do n't tell me that , I do n't care if you are '' make the point that God does n't care what you 're going through , he has his own issues to deal with .
Seether frontman Sean Morgan 's birth surname is Welgemoed , but rumor has it that he changed it to Morgan after his mother disowned him due to his views on Christianity .
