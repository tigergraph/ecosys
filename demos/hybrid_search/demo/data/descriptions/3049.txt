James Taylor wrote this about the time of his recovery from his addictions to cocaine , methadone , liquor and tobacco .
However , he does n't reveal the identity of the woman he 's singing to in the chorus where he sings , `` I got ta spend , a little more time with you , Babe . ''
This song won the 1997 Grammy Award for Song Of The Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance .
This song also helped James Taylor 's Hourglass win the 1997 Grammy Award for Album Of The Year .
Stevie Wonder wrote the harmonica parts , which he played on this song , while Taylor softly strummed his acoustic guitar .
Taylor appeared on VH1 's Storytellers series , which was filmed a few weeks before Hourglass was released in June of 1997 .
On the show , James played several of his memorable hit recordings , Including `` Mexico , '' `` Fire And Rain '' and Sweet Baby James , '' and told the stories behind each of them .
Before he started strumming the opening notes of this song , Taylor told the story behind it , in a tone that was very entertaining to the studio audience .
He finished the story with the humorous and crowd-pleasing statement , `` This is just basically , yer Love Jones ! ''
