Doherty 's friend , the poet Peter `` Wolfman '' Wolfe , is the guitarist and co-writer on this song .
Doherty had previously made a guest appearance on Wolfe 's U.K # 7 single and Ivor Novello Award-nominated song `` For Lovers . ''
Doherty told the NME March 21 , 2009 , that this song is about his time in Wormwood Scrubs prison for breaching a probation order .
He explained : `` People writing , saying they 'd like to see me swinging -LRB- hanging himself . -RRB-
Hard when you ca n't see the light fittings . ''
An earlier version was recorded with producer Jake Fior , who also helmed `` For Lovers . ''
However Doherty binned those recordings in favor of Stephen Street who had previously produced Babyshambles ' Shotters Nation .
Some of the lyrical ideas for this song were inspired by Oscar Wilde 's The Ballad of Reading Gaol .
The Irish playwright wrote the poem in 1897 after his release from Reading jail , where he 'd been incarcerated for homosexual offences .
