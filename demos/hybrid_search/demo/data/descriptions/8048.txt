This song is about the famous New Testament `` Love '' chapter of 1 Corinthians 13 .
Heath explained to Christian Music Today why this is his favorite track from What If We : `` I 've always liked ballads a bit more than up-tempo songs because they have more feeling to them .
It was written with my friend Chad Cates from when we were in a Bible study together , and the focus of that group was 1 Corinthians 13 .
We dissected it for like 12 weeks , and it ended up impacting me on so many more levels , not just in understanding romantic love , but also loving in a more practical , everyday way .
We are called to love the world , and -LSB- this passage -RSB- is about how it should look . ''
Brandon Heath performed this affectionate tune at Country music superstar Carrie Underwood 's wedding to Canadian hockey player Mike Fisher on July 10 , 2010 .
Noted as the couple 's song , Heath 's performance of the tune served as the couple 's first dance , and was Carrie 's surprise for the groom .
