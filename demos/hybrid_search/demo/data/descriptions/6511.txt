Guitarist Amber Coffman takes a solo turn on this sweet and yearning R&B song .
Frontman and songwriter Dave Longstreth told Tonedeaf.com : `` This is one of those stories , about something you might have experienced in a high school , such as being in love with a girl in a cool crowd , or maybe having a platonic crash on your friend .
It 's one of those songs .
My high school experience was n't like that , neither was Amber 's .
But you could relate to it .
You do n't know if it 's from your own experiences , but it feels familiar enough that it might be , or maybe that 's because it 's clich√© . ''
