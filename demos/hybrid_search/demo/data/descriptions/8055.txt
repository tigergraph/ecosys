This is a cover of a number written and recorded in the '70s by Louisiana guitarist-preacher Rev. Charlie Jackson .
Lead singer Chris Robinson explained to The Black Crowes Bootleg Project why they decided to cover it : `` Let 's not get too hung up about Easter , man .
We have n't really done a cover on a record in a while , and I just always loved this song .
I do n't think half the guys in the band had heard it .
I played it for everybody and they all jumped up and started doing it .
It was also another way to get into our roots . ''
