Bassist Richard Boucher explained to Alternative Press magazine that this is , `` a song about obsession and not being able to control your thoughts . ''
The breakdown in the midsection came from a jam in rehearsals .
Boucher commented to Alternative Press : `` It 's always amazing when things are spontaneous and just work . ''
The song was originally written on a seven-string guitar , but the band felt it sounded a little too low so they transposed it to six .
