Welcome 2 My Nightmare was recorded with longtime Alice collaborator Bob Ezrin , who produced the original Welcome To My Nightmare album in 1975 as well as 10 other albums in the rocker 's catalog .
Ezrin and the veteran rocker also wrote this track together .
Cooper told the story of the song in an interview with Classic Rock Revisited : `` Bob and I learned a long time ago that when you start writing a song , and it starts developing it 's own personality ; you just have to let it be what it is .
You ca n't try to force a round peg in a square hole .
Just write the song , see what it ends up being and then see if it works .
You ca n't start trying to twist it into what you want it to be .
Bob and I started writing this song , `` Last Man On Earth '' and it ended up being a Tom Waits song -- I sing it somewhere between Tom Waits and Jimmy Durante .
When I saw Tom at the Hall of Fame I said , ` Tom , this is going to sound weird , but I 've always been a big fan of yours .
I have written a new song that , coincidentally , is a tip of the hat to you .
When you hear it , you will know which song I am talking about .
` That song really ended up coming out well and it really fit the story line well .
It reminds of that old Twilight Zone with Burgess Meredith where he ends up in the basement because of an atomic explosion .
When he finally goes upstairs , he 's now got all of the books in the world but he then breaks his glasses and now he ca n't read them .
That was kind of this idea .
Alice is the last man on earth .
He can stink , he can swear and he can do anything he wants to do because there is no one there to tell him ` yes ' or ` no ' . ''
