The songs from Dar Williams ' ninth studio were written around the concept of classic tales from Ancient Greece , which she was told as a child .
However , the final track brings us back into the 21st century as Williams reminds us that wherever we are , whenever it may be , we are always living In the Time of Gods .
`` We have a mountain close to our house called Storm King , '' explained the New England folk singer .
`` When a circle of clouds gathers around the top of it , that means the rain is coming .
Pete Seeger lives across the river and can see the mountain , and I wrote a song saying that Pete is the storm king now .
He looks down and watches over us , guides and warns us , like the mountain does.So my ` Storm King ' is not a king of Greek mythology , '' Williams continued .
`` He 's a father figure who influences me from two miles up the road , where he composts and chops his own wood , and reminds me of my responsibilities .
` Storm King ' is my way of saying that we are n't living in 400 BC Greece , we are evolving in time .
And that 's what you 're allowed to do with mythology - to let it evolve and show who your Parthenon is now . ''
Williams explained the significance of the album title to American Songwriter : `` We live in a time of precipitous ups and downs right now .
The people on top fall to the bottom , those one the bottom are rising up , we 've got massive weather events , and throughout it all , we have people railing away about what we have to do -LRB- drill more , plant tomatoes , build an ark , etc. -RRB- .
The album 's themes came from Greek mythology , which made room for massive chaos while still exalting the pillars of civilization .
That 's how I feel , like we 're the playthings of petty , angry gods , especially the ones that walk the Earth , but that the Parthenon is still standing on the hill , surrounded by olive trees .
Perhaps less virgins . ''
