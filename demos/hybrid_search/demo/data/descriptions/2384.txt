Radin told the story of the song to IndieLondon : `` That was about a girl that I 've never met .
She used to drive by my house all the time in that car that I describe .
In LA , a lot of people take these old beat up Mercedes that run on diesel gas ... you can convert them very cheaply to run on vegetable oil .
We call them vegetable cars and you see them all over LA. .
It 'll say this car runs on vegetable oil on the bumper sticker ... but this beautiful girl would drive by my house all the time while I was sitting outside playing guitar .
I did n't really have the courage to go and talk to her , so I figured I 'd write a song about her and maybe it would be on the radio .
In my mind she 'd drive by with the windows down and it would be on the radio -LSB- smiles -RSB- .
That would be my in , I 'd be like : ` Hey , I wrote that about you .
I 'm Josh . '
But it never happened and then I moved back to New York City , so I never met her .
Maybe I 'll run into her one day . ''
