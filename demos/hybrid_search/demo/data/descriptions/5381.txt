Norwegian rocker Ida Maria 's first single from the American release of her second album , Katla , was recorded in Santa Monica with Butch Walker , who is the hitmaker behind tunes by Weezer , Katy Perry and Pink .
The song finds Maria singing about women paying more attention to their men .
She explained to Spin magazine it contrasts with the current trend where `` girls are singing so much about all the attention we need .
I felt like there was a need to write something about the guys . ''
