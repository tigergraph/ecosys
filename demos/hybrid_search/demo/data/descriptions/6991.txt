This is the title track from the debut album by English singer-songwriter Clare Maguire .
She explained the title to CMU : `` I knew before writing this album that I wanted it to be called ` Light After Dark ' .
I like the vision and the uplifting sentiment and wanted all of the songs to have the same feel but different stories . ''
