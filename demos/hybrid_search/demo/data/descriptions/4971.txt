In Ian Gillan 's autobiography , he explained that this song began as a joke : someone mentioned the classical composition `` Flight of the Bumble Bee '' and Jon Lord started playing variations around it .
`` The Rat '' is a reference to a drug habit - Deep Purple made occasional anti-drug references in their songs - `` Into The Fire '' was another .
