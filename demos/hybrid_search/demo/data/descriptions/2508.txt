This celebration of love and music is based around a sample of Tchaikovsky 's Nutcracker Suite .
Chris Lowe explained the album title to CBC News : '' I think the reason we chose this album title was because it 's a very positive , uplifting-sounding album .
There 's a lot of hope in there , and musically it 's very positive , uplifting , a very shiny pop record .
And in that sense it 's like our album Very .
It 's that sort of album title , which expresses the sentiments and feelings of the music contained within it . ''
