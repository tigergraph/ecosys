This is the title track of German pop rock band Tokio Hotel 's third German and second English studio album .
In an interview for iTunes , Kaulitz explained that the band came up with the album title prior to the writing of this song .
He explained : `` We had the album name first , but it did n't take long before the song `` humanoid '' was there '' Kaulitz added : `` Humanoid is like a feeling about life that we have .
The song is a bit like history , it takes you to a whole different universe .
It 's not a typical song , we let go of all the typical song structures , and there are a lot of different feelings and melodies in it , it became a whole different song , and that 's what Humanoid is to us . ''
Tokio Hotel recorded both German and English versions of Humanoid .
Kaulitz discussed with MTV News having to sing in German and English .
`` They have to do this super-complicated thing : change the session from German to English , '' he explained .
`` Yes , constant switches .
I believe no other singer has to remember so many different lyrics like I do .
It 's only the third album , and I already have 10,000 songs . ''
On this song singer Bill Kaulitz shifts melodies a number of times over a backing of revved-up guitars .
He told Rolling Stone : `` At the end of this track we got rid of all the normal song structures .
` Humanoid ' has so many different parts and melodies , it 's a weird journey that might be a little confusing at the beginning , but we ca n't wait to play it live . ''
Producer/songwriter David Jost told MTV News that Kaulitz came up with the album title , Humanoid .
He explained : `` The word ` Humanoid ' comes from the science-fiction language , meaning ` humanlike . '
This word is pronounced differently in the English and German language but is written the same way in both languages .
Bill wanted the new record to have only one name worldwide : Humanoid . ''
