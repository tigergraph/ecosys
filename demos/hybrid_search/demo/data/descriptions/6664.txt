Adult contemporary singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw found himself working with co-writers for the first time on his fourth album , Sweeter , as a way to broaden his horizons .
This is one of two songs he wrote with Andrew Frampton , who is known for his work with Natasha Bedingfield and The Script .
`` Co-writing with other people changed everything for me , '' said DeGraw .
`` Not only did it open my mind to new ideas , but it changed the way I wrote on my own .
Playing all these different styles with other musicians led me to think about things differently when I was working by myself .
I was able to tap into things I do live , dabbling with some of that late '60s , early '70s R&B stuff ; I was able to record all the styles of music that I like and put them on one album .
It was great to take my leash off and experiment .
Although it does n't stray too far from what I 've done , I think it 's the first album I 've made that has caught my true sound . ''
The song finds DeGraw casting himself as the romantic bad guy as he confesses , `` I know a woman 's nature/There 's nothing you can save here/Me , I run every time . ''
