Soulsavers are an English production and remix team comprised of Rich Machin and Ian Glover .
This song is a track from their third studio album , Broken .
The ghoulish and unsettling video was directed by Hiro Murai .
The director said in publicity materials : `` The initial concept for ` Unbalanced Pieces ' came from a conversation I had with the band over our shared love for David Lynch , especially his off putting ambiguity and uncanny portrayal of a dystopian suburbia .
The making of the video consisted of shooting still photographs of suburban Rancho Cucamonga , which we then projected inside a dark studio to give us a surreal sense of space and atmosphere . ''
The song features on vocals frequent collaborator Mark Lanegan and Faith No More 's Mike Patton .
