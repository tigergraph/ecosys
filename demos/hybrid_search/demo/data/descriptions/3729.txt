This sprawling slice of electronic raga features all four members of the band in the same room , playing together at the same time .
`` We have n't done something so aggressive for some time , Noah `` Panda Bear '' Lennox told NME .
`` We were all crammed into a small room with the amps pointed at us .
I was playing drums in the middle prompting people to crank it up .
It definitely felt more like a unified expression rather than something that was pierced together from four individual characters . ''
Deakin admitted to eMusic that it `` felt challenging '' being the principal songwriter on an Animal Collective cut .
`` These guys were really psyched about it , '' he said .
`` When I brought it up to them , they were like , ` Do it . '
I was already working on the song .
It was one of the first songs we actually worked on , and they were all psyched on it , so I felt really easy and safe just to try it .
It 's definitely a new thing , in a good way .
I 'd always experienced , like , Dave having a song and Noah having a song .
It was interesting to be the one who wrote the song , and have someone like Dave being like , ' I think this sounds really good , ' and me being like , ' I know , but it 's not quite right . '
It 's a good perspective . ''
Centipede Hz saw the return of Josh ` Deakin ' Dibb to Animal Collective , after he sat out of the recording and touring of Merriweather Post Pavilion .
This psychedelic tune finds him dispensing cryptic observations as he reflects on both the difficulties of living and his attempts at getting past them .
`` Though I 'm overwhelmed at times .
I find I 'm less afraid of change , '' he sings .
It marks the first Animal Collective song where Deakin sings lead vocals .
