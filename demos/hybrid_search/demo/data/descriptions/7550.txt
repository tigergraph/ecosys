The Dave Rawlings Machine started `` accidentally , '' Rawlings told Billboard magazine , as a vehicle to semi-anonymously road test some new material .
He added : `` You start out singing other people 's songs 'cause you love them , and at some point you start to feel like you 'd like to sing some of your own .
I think that happens to most people .
It 's just happening to me much later . ''
