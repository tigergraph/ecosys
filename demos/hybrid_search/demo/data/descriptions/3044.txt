This jangly , angst-filled power ballad finds Robbie duetting with American alternative folkie Lissie .
Said Williams : `` Lissie 's just amazing .
She is an amazing singer ... she 's like Stevie Nicks .
There 's this bit of craziness at the end , and it just goes into a different gear . ''
The song is a cover of a recording by American vocal and instrumental duo Belle Brigade , which originally featured on their 2011 eponymous debut album .
Robbie commented to The Sun : `` In 1997 or 1998 , ` Losers ' would have been a single .
Now you wo n't be able to play ` Losers ' on the radio .
Times have really changed - listen to 'S -- t On The Radio ' and you will know . ''
