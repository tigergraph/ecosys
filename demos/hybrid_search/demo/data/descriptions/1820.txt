This track from singer-songwriter Nerina Pallot 's fourth studio album Year of the Wolf finds her waxing lustfully lyrical .
She explained to The Sun newspaper : `` A lot of my favorite songs are basically shagging .
I defy anyone to put on ` Let 's Get It On ' by Marvin Gaye and not want to shag the nearest person to them .
Music can make you feel really horny . ''
