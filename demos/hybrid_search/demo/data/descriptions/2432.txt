Two Door Cinema Club open their second album , Beacon , with this cut on which vocalist Alex Trimble bemoans being on tour away from his girl .
He goes on to promise her he 'll be `` back home next year . ''
The record was influenced by the months that the Irish group spent on the road touring their debut release .
`` We 've really concentrated on capturing one certain feel or one certain moment in time , '' Trimble told Billboard magazine , `` and making the music bring us back to that day . ''
Trimble told NME : `` It was one of the first new ones we put down on the record after ` Handshake ' , ` Sleep Alone ' and ` Settle ' , which were written quite a long time before that .
It 's a song for friends who we never see . ''
