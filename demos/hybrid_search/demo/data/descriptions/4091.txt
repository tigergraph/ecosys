Like many of the tracks on Shallow Bed , this tale of a family torn apart by alcoholism features religious imagery .
Though not a believer now , frontman Pete Liddle grew up going to a Catholic school and learned to sing in church .
`` All my early music education was full church music education , '' he explained to Spinner .
`` The first 10 years I was singing , it was exclusively hymns and church songs , so I think that had something to do with it .
And then , you know , just the songwriters that I was presented with as a kid , stuff that my folks had on in the house , like Leonard Cohen and Paul Simon , people who liked to dabble with religious imagery as more a poetic tool than a conscious effort to say something about religion or belief .
