This singalong is titled after frontman Alex Ebert 's daughter .
`` We were all touring on the train tour with Mumford and Old Crow , '' the singer recalled to Spinner , `` and I just started writing this song and the word that kept coming up was Mayla and so that was it .
I played it for them and they loved it .
Apparently they listen to it all the time and she loves the song . ''
