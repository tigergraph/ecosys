Hail To The King was produced by Mike Elizondo .
The Los Angeles producer and songwriter is best known for his Hip-Hop collaborations with artists such as Eminem and 50 Cent .
He previously worked with Avenged Sevenfold on their 2010 album Nightmare .
Guitarist Synyster Gates told MusicRadar.com it was Elizondo who suggested this track .
`` He was hearing a kind of low vocal , swagger-based rock song , '' he explained , `` sort of a quintessential '80s or '90s vibe but with a very modern approach .
It 's a bad freight train that never stops . ''
The song is about the band going to their favorite bar -LRB- Johnny 's Saloon in Huntingdon Beach , Orange County , California -RRB- and getting themselves in trouble .
Vocalist M. Shadows explained to Kerrang !
magazine : `` It 's about the prison in your mind - the prison of going there to drink away your problems .
Everybody 's in the same mind-set there and everybody 's doing their time .
For us , it was a metaphor about being trapped in your own head and using devices to even that out and make it better . ''
`` We went to Johnny 's a lot during the making of this record , '' he continued . ''
It 's a place where we wrote -LRB- 2003 's -RRB- Waking The Fallen and -LRB- 2005 's -RRB- City Of Evil too .
Every night when we 'd finished writing , we 'd go and have a drink .
We kind of got away from that with the white album -LRB- their self-titled 2007 record -RRB- and -LRB- 2010 's -RRB- Nightmare .
It 's one of those places that 's like a family there , so we tried to get back to that a little bit on the record . ''
