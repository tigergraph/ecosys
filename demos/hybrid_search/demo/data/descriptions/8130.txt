T.I. offers his rags-to-riches story in which `` living on the edge '' was `` just a habit '' on the opening introductory track for Trouble Man : Heavy is the Head .
The song samples Marvin Gaye 's `` Trouble Man . ''
Speaking to BET 's 106 & Park , Tip explained why he both borrowed from Marvin Gaye 's classic track both for this song and the album title .
`` I felt like at that moment in time , Marvin Gaye 's life embodied what the word ` Trouble Man ' and what the song meant in all senses of the word , '' he explained .
`` And today ... I feel like the past six , seven years of my life , and the adversity ... in my life that I have endured and overcame , that is synonymous and it embodies what the word ` Trouble Man ' means today . ''
`` Marvin Gaye did it for them back then , and I 'm doing it for us right now , '' he added .
`` Nothing but love and respect , and nothing but salutations and respect to Marvin Gaye and his whole family . ''
