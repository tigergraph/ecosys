Unlike the Tennessee-based Kings of Leon 's previous efforts which centered around Nashville as a base , Come Around Sundown was recorded in New York at Avatar Studios .
It was reported that the quartet did not enjoy the regimented regime there and this delicate but powerful echo-chamber melodrama is filled with yearning for their home state .
`` If you give up New York , I 'll give you Tennessee , the only place to be , '' Caleb sings .
Some music writers have interpreted this song as Caleb addressing his girlfriend , model Lily Aldridge , who is unhappy about something in their relationship - maybe the level of his fame and the temptations to stray this creates .
The singer is encouraging her not to `` shy away '' and to `` ride out '' this `` wave '' as she 's the `` one and only face '' for him .
