Night of Hunters is a 21st century song cycle in which Tori Amos tells the story of a woman , Tori , who finds herself in the dying embers of a relationship .
This song finds her accepting blame for the breakup and introduces a shape-shifting creature named Annabelle who joins Tori as she tries to understand where their love went wrong .
The part of Annabelle is sung by Amos 's 11-year-old daughter Natashya , who duets with her mother on this song plus several others .
Elsewhere , her 19-year-old niece , Kelsey Dobyns , sings the part of Fire Muse .
`` Having their energies on there made sense , '' Amos told Mojo magazine .
`` That 's who I would turn to on a dark night . ''
This is based on the song `` AÃ±oranza '' from 6 Pieces on Spanish Folksongs by Spanish composer Enrique Granados -LRB- 1867-1916 -RRB- .
