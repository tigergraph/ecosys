This features Akon on the hook and Rick Ross , Young Jeezy , Lil ' Boosie , Trick Daddy , Ace Hood and Plies spitting out the verses in that order .
Lil Wayne was on the original version but Young Jeezy replaced him on the single release .
Ace Hood became the first artist to be signed to DJ Khaled 's new label imprint , We The Best , around the time he was contributing to this song .
He was asked by DJBooth.net how he 'd define grindin ' He replied : `` I define , `` grindin ' , '' as just non-stop work , man !
Non-stop work , non-stop progress .
Ca n't sleep during that grind - I mean , you get a little bit of it , but if you 're progressin ' at every hour , every second , you grindin ' .
You gettin ' it , you gettin ' it in .
No matter what you may be doin ' , if you write a song , you just wrote fifteen songs , you write more .
Anything that describes as far as progress is grindin ' . ''
