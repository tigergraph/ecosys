Five Finger Death Punch guitarist Zoltan Bathory explained this song 's military theme to Metal Hammer `` I 've always had a strong connection with the military .
I grew up in military bases , I like military movies , and we have a lot of fans who are serving in the forces .
`` I guess what I 'm really interested in is the concept of ` heroism ' what it is that gives someone the balls to stand in the front line when the bullets are flying .
People who have the capacity to do this generally have a very strong bond with other people in the same situation .
Adversity creates a genuine feeling of brotherhood , and actually , that 's something I can detect amongst our fans -- they stick together , they look after each other in the mosh-pit , they 're just a very dedicated bunch .
`` He added : '' ` No-One Gets Left Behind ' is an old military saying , like ` Death Before Dishonour , ' so I guess this is a continuation of that track on our first album ... Oh , and the radio broadcast you can hear is taken from the transcript of a medical evacuation that we were given by one of our fans in the forces -- the code names , the numbers , it 's all real . ''
