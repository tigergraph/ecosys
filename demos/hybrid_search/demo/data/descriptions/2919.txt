Eel 's 10th album Wonderful Glorious concludes with the optimistic title track .
Mark `` E '' Everett explained to The Line Of Best Fit : `` There 's a reason the album starts with ` Bombs Away , ' which is coming from a darker place , and ends up with the title track at the end , which is getting to a very bright place .
It 's all about how you 've got to go through all the dark places to get to the brighter place . ''
