This song is about Hel , the name of the goddess of the abode of the dead in early Scandinavian mythology .
She was the daughter of Loki , the main protagonist of the Deceiver of the Gods album .
The track features a guest appearance from former Candlemass singer Messiah Marcolin .
Vocalist Johan Hegg explained to Lords Of Metal : `` When we had written the song , we thought about adding any female vocals .
But in the end we thought it would sound better when Messiah would do it .
I knew him already from a cruise in Scandinavia and now we had a song that would suit him .
So we sent him the tape with already my vocals on it and he improvised doing his additional vocals . ''
