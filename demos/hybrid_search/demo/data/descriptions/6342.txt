It also includes a new set , Versus , which acts as a conceptual sequel and final chapter of Raymond V. Raymond .
For those of you who like chart trivia , this spent four consecutive weeks at # 20 on the UK singles chart .
Unfortunately , the Songfacts computers were unable to ascertain whether this was a record run on the bottom rung of the UK Top 20 .
`` DJ Got Us '' features Cuban-American rapper Pitbull and was produced by Swedish production legend Max Martin -LRB- Pink , Britney Spears , Katy Perry , Kelly Clarkson -RRB- .
This was one of about 200 songs that was written for Rihanna 's album Loud .
