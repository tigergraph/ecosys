This New Wave rave-up finds Gwen Stefani spouting tongue-in-cheek lyrics about being a well-preserved forty-something frontwoman .
`` Go ahead and look at me cause that 's what I want .
Take a good look wo n't you please cause that 's what I want , '' she sings .
`` I know you want to stare .
You ca n't help it and I do n't care . ''
According to Stefani , this nearly did n't make the cut for Push and Shove .
Indeed , the band were n't sure if it was a song at all . ''
-LSB- It -RSB- was one of those songs that was almost thrown away , '' she told MTV News .
`` It was an end of a song that turned into a chorus that ended up being -LSB- a song -RSB- ... it was one of those weird transitional songs . ''
The song was released as the official second single from Push and Shove .
Technically , the album was Stefani 's first appearance on record since her uncredited backup vocals on husband Gavin Rossdale 's 2008 solo set Wanderlust .
The song 's Melina Matsoukas directed video featured Native American imagery and included singer Gwen Stefani wearing a feathered headdress dancing in a tepee , whilst No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal was also adorned in indigenous attire .
The group quickly pulled the video after members of the Native American community complained despite their efforts to include expert input on Native American culture .
