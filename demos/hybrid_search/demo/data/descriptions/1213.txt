This track from Post hardcore glam metal band Black Veil Brides ' debut album We Stitch These Wounds was inspired by the health problems the mother of guitarist Jake Pitts has gone through .
Frontman Andy Biersack explained to Artist Direct : `` It 's the first song that I ever wrote lyrically from someone else 's perspective .
It 's about Jake 's mother who has struggled with illness and how he felt .
When you find out that someone 's sick , there 's nothing you can really do except say that you 're there and you 're going to try to help or do whatever you can .
At the end of the day , you ca n't really cure someone if they 're sick .
I took Jake 's story and tried to put my own perspective on it .
Like anything in life , if there 's a situation where you see something terrible is happening and you ca n't necessarily stop it , the least you can do is promise you 're going to be there for the person who 's being affected by it . ''
