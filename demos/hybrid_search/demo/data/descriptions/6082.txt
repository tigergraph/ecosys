Irish Folk music singer-songwriter James Vincent McMorrow opens his debut album Early In The Morning with this swirling track .
`` I always knew when I wrote this song that it would open the album , '' he said .
`` The lyric is very much about transition , about change .
That is definitely the underlying theme that ties it all together .
The last 2 years that preceded this record being made involved some of the greatest change I 'd ever experienced , physical , emotional , and spiritual .
When I write lyrics they come together in a pretty uncoordinated way , lines get written , slowly link up until a story reveals itself .
It was only when I was finished that I looked back and saw the words for what they were , realized what they meant . ''
The album Early In The Morning was penned by McMorrow during a self-imposed seclusion in an isolated house by the sea .
It was released in February 2010 on the Vagrant label .
