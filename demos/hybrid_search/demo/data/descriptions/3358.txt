`` That 's an interesting one , '' lead singer Steve Adams told us .
`` I think that every so often you write a song as an exercise , to try something out .
The longer I 've been writing songs the more I like to look at it as an exercise , and sort of stretch myself a bit .
And that was one that I thought I 'd like to write a comedy song , singing about that , and it was that simple . ''
The lead singer takes a moment to think , and then offers a sort of apology : `` That 's a really boring answer , actually , but that 's what it sounds like .
It was completely written as an exercise with no malice aforethought .
The lady that I sang originally with as a duet , she and I got on quite well , so there was n't any spite at all .
-LRB- laughing -RRB- I was in a really good mood for the entire time I was writing it . ''
The sweet verse at the end of the song is quite shocking , coming on the heels of an entire diatribe about the different ways the main characters gleefully imagine each other dying .
The explanation for that is a bit murky , because , according to Steve , no one 's ever really been interested in it , `` and I never thought anybody would be . ''
He describes it as a `` sappy song that 's been a little spoiled '' for him .
`` Me and the lady who sang on the Balls version kind of fell out , and as she has a co-write on it I 'm happier just letting it lie .
It was just an exercise in writing a kind of comedy duet really .
She had come up with some very rude words to end the song with , and when we decided she should n't use that , she re-wrote it into that very sweet version .
We had some fun doing it live with other singers and we re-recorded a great single version with the wonderful Eddi Reader , but I do n't mind if I never hear it again .
It 's been used on a movie over here , and they used the album version , so we 'll probably leave it at that . ''
