The second single from bassist and vocalist Stephen `` Thundercat '' Bruner 's sophomore album Apocalypse tells the true story of an MDMA-fueled New Year 's party .
`` That party was one of the most epic things that has ever happened , '' Thundercat told Rolling Stone with a laugh .
`` Two and a half days of full-on shenanigans , man . ''
Apocalypse was produced by Californian experimental multi-genre music producer Flying Lotus .
He said of this track : `` I always loved this song , it 's actually the oldest of the bunch .
It 's probably 2 years old .
` Oh s -- t I 'm fu -- ed up , ' you do n't know what kind of battle I went thru to actually have those words come out on this album - he was like ` my mom is gon na hear that !! ' I said ` that would be everyone 's favorite part of the song . ' ''
