This radio-friendly Pop anthem was released as a promotional single from Swedish electro-pop singer-songwriter Robyn 's fifth album , Body Talk Pt .
1 .
Thanks to strong sales and frequent airplay , the song reached # 3 on the Swedish Singles Chart and # 10 on the Norwegian Singles Chart .
Robyn explores in this song the idea of a futuristic synthetic mate .
Spinner UK asked the singer if she is a sci-fi nerd ?
She replied : `` Totally , I 'm a nerd for sure .
But for me , writing about robots , I 'm not trying to predict the future or anything .
It 's more like , it 's a nice metaphor -- it 's more about the human condition for me than talking about robots .
But of course in a song like ` Fembot ' it 's also fun to use those words , and you can play around with them and it 's a lot easier to understand than if I wrote a song about political issues or women 's bodies .
It 's trying to put it in a context so that people can understand what I mean .
And dance to it too . ''
On the surface , this song appears to be about turning 30 and contemplating children , however Robyn told Stereogum she thinks of the song is a bit more complex .
`` People expect things of you , like kids and like marriage , and I found myself just thinking of that a lot while making this record , so the song is about that in a way , but it 's also fun , '' she said .
`` I 'm playing around with the concept of being a woman , and what it means to physically be able to carry kids , but at the same time that 's not always what you see yourself as . ''
