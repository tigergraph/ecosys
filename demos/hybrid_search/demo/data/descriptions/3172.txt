Lead vocalist Hannah Blaylock penned this cut with her friend , Nashville songwriter Laura Veltz .
Blaylock recounted the story of this party track : `` Two things we appreciate about country music are the respect for the ones that have come before us and the timeless feel of a two steppin ' , fun-lovin , ' down-home country song that never goes out of style , '' she said .
`` I started thinking about how many songs our beloved cowboy stars write about their favorite sidekicks on a rowdy night and I started getting REALLY excited .
So I called up my all-time favorite co-writer and dearest friend , Laura Veltz , and we started getting to work .
It was such a fun write for us , much like how you get sucked into a good book .
We actually stretched out finishing it because we almost did n't want the fun to end !
Let me just say that after that process , I have a longer list than any sane person should of cowboys and the ` hair on their chest ' beverages they like to sing about . ''
