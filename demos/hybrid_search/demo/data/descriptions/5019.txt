Canadian hardcore punk band Cancer Bats open Dead Set on Living with this track , which finds vocalist Liam Cormier at his most angry .
He told Terrorizer magazine : `` R.A.T.S is just about being fu -- ing pissed off .
It 's kinda like my ` Sorceress ' part two .
In the first version there was two verses and it started off with ' I never thought I 'd have to write this song again . '
It has a ` Sorceress ' track to get all that anger out and then realizing the world over and people asking for that song every night , it 's like man there 's no shortage of people being pissed off in the world .
It kinda was around the D.S.O.L thing too , ` cos I was just like , your best friend 's in the hospital and then you 're just like ` who the f -- k put him here ? '
Those kind of ideas start evolving in your head .
So that was my ` f -- k you ' to the world . ''
The song 's music video was shot in Bulgaria during Cancer Bats ' 2013 European tour .
The clip follows a man who has recently been terminated from his employment .
The song features guest vocals from Rob Urbinati of Canadian Thrash Metal band Sacrifice .
