The Wainwright clan has been spilling their guts through music for years , and it 's as messy as it sounds .
Wainwright 's divorce from singer Kate McGarrigle laid the groundwork for a rocky relationship with his children , whom he left to be raised by their mother .
Son Rufus confronted his dad with `` Dinner At Eight , '' in which he sings `` Daddy , do n't be surprised if I wan na see the tears in your eyes . ''
Daughter Martha penned `` Bloody Mother F -- king A -- hole '' in honor of Loudon 's parenting skills.But the Wainwrights prove familial bonds are hard to break .
Rufus and Martha - along with Wainwright 's two other children Lucy Wainwright Roche and Alexandra Kelly Wainwright - appear on the Older Than My Old Man album album , making `` All in a Family '' even more poignant with lyrics like `` Forgive and forget , and finally see the forest from the family tree . ''
`` People in your family and people you are close to have the ability to hurt you , '' Loudon told the Seattle Times .
`` But forgiveness is an important thing to work on .
Because I think you ca n't forgive yourself unless you forgive these other people . ''
