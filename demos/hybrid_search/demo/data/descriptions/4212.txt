This is the second single from American rapper Rick Ross 's fourth studio album , Teflon Don .
The song features New York born hip-hop artist Styles P , who is one of the founding members of the rap group The LOX along with Jadakiss , Louch and Chris `` Lil Mac '' Pelkey .
The original `` Teflon Don '' was 1980s New York mobster John Gotti , who earned his nickname because of his apparent inability to get convicted .
In an interview with the New York Daily News , a member of Gotti 's family expressed his unhappiness at Ross ' use of the late mob boss ' handle .
`` He should have asked for permission , '' Gotti 's grandson Carmine Agnello said .
`` A stand-up , respectable guy would come and ask , ` If I could use the nickname . '
`` Agnello added : `` I think he 's a great artist , but you ca n't just start calling yourself that to sell records .
He wants to go for that whole image , but hey , be yourself .
My grandfather paid his dues for that nickname .
That was my grandfather 's life . ''
The album title refers to Ross 's original rap name , Teflon Don .
He told MTV News : `` You got ta understand , I feel like I overcame so many things .
Not only in music , but in my everyday life - being a young black man , being an entrepreneur , being a father .
I learned a lot of things .
I 'm turning right around , putting it back into music .
It 's still a lot of things I deal with .
Still a lot of negativity .
That 's what it is , and that 's why I feel the title of my next studio album is so appropriate . ''
The song was produced by Virginia beatsmith Lex Luger , who was still in his teens when he helmed the cut .
He told MTV News : `` To take something that a lot of people thought was nothing and to turn it into another dimension of sound was crazy to me .
The reaction from people that I saw was crazy to me .
That 's when I really knew this is what I wanted to do . ''
