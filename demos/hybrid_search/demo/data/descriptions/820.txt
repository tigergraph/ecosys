This is a track from Extended Play , Fleetwood Mac 's four song disc , their first collection of new tunes since 2003 's Say You Will .
`` I knew we would n't have time to cut a new album , '' Lindsey Buckingham told Rolling Stone .
`` Stevie -LSB- Nicks -RSB- was still caught up in her solo thing , but I got John -LSB- McVie -RSB- and Mick -LSB- Fleetwood -RSB- over from Hawaii .
They played their asses off .
It was a great experience . ''
The song reflects on former lovers , Nicks and Buckingham 's , complex relationship .
`` All these years later , we are still writing songs that are dialogues for each other , '' Buckingham told Rolling Stone .
`` That was part of the appeal of Rumours , and of the group in general ... Of all the things we cut , ` Sad Angel ' was , for lack of a better term , the most Fleetwood Mac-y .
It was really kind of the best stuff that we have done in a while . ''
Stevie Nicks arrived at the sessions towards the end , and Buckingham presented her with this tune in which the pair harmonize over the latter 's twisting guitar and Mick Fleetwood 's energetic drumming .
`` I wrote that song for Stevie , '' Buckingham told Rolling Stone .
`` She always had to fight for everything .
She was coming off a solo album and was in the process of reintegrating herself mentally in the band , and we 're all warriors with a sword in one sort or another .
She and I have known each other since high school .
So I just wrote , ` Sad Angel have you come to fight the war .
We fall to earth together , the crowd calling out for more . ' ''
