This is the fourth single to be taken from American R&B recording artist Trey Songz 's fifth studio album , Ready .
Songz discussed this song with MTV News : `` It 's a groove record .
It 's got that knock at the same time .
It 's sexy at the same time .
Conceptually , it 's mind-blowing to tell a woman , ` You gon na think we invented sex when we 're done . '
That 's where I am .
Even with records like ` Say Aah , ' conceptually I wan na think outside the box .
You think about a record like ` LOL :--RRB- , ' it 's something real simple , but when you look at the title or listen to the record , you 're like , ` Wow . '
That 's something great from a songwriter 's perspective .
I 'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life . ''
This was Songz 's first # 1 on Billboard 's R&B / Hip-Hop Songs chart .
The song features the Canadian hip hop artist Drake .
Songz also collaborated with Drake on the latter 's hit single , `` Successful . ''
Songz told MTV News that the song 's music video is a continuation of the one for `` Say Aah . ''
He added : `` It 's very sensual .
The idea I had , it came from a banned Calvin Klein ad .
It was a dude and two girls and they was touching and kissing .
I was like , ` Man , I wan na do that . '
We did n't go all the way there .
I did n't have two girls - we simulated best we could , and it 's more sensual than raunchy . ''
Songz ' label originally did n't see this as a potential hit .
`` We wrote the song and sent it over to -LSB- Songz -RSB- because I thought the song was a hit and a good fit , '' songwriter Carlos `` Los DaMystro '' McKinney told Billboard magazine .
`` He demoed it , but because of politics and bulls -- t , -LSB- the song was n't going to be released -RSB- .
It actually leaked , and after they saw the reception it got , that 's when they decided to add it . ''
`` Certain people at the label did n't believe in the record , '' Songz added .
`` It was said the chorus was complicated and would n't do well in research at radio .
We were asked to change the chorus so that the line ' I invented sex ' came earlier .
I wanted it to be a single and the label was n't onboard with that until after the record began to move on its own . ''
