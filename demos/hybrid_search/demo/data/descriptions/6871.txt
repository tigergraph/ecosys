This acoustic driven track is the third single from Seattle rock band Alice In Chains ' fourth studio album , Black Gives Way to Blue .
The song contains lyrics about `` surviving pain and choosing to live '' and concerns the drug addiction troubles that eventually led to their previous vocalist Layne Staley 's death .
A video was filmed for this song in late October at an ornate Malibu mansion .
It was directed by Steven Schuster , who previously helmed the band 's `` A Looking In View '' clip .
