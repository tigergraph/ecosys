Kevin Parker told NME about the spoken-word part that is beamed in as the music fades on this track .
`` Oh , that 's my girlfriend , '' he said .
`` It was scripted , yeah .
It 's meant to be the sound of someone suddenly leaving a venue , like one of those scenes in a movie where someone 's having a hard time and they go outside to stare at the stars .
And one of the other characters comes outside and says , ` Hey man , what 's going on ?
What are you doing outside , are you alright ?
Are you thinking about everything ?
So they 're trying to comfort the person .
It 's just that scene ... I love it . ''
