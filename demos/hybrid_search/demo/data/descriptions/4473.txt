This is one of three Grant McLennan songs completed by Forster after the death of his former Go-Between partner .
Forster told Mojo magazine June 2008 about this tribute to McLennan : `` It 's a very jaunty song , very typical of Grant .
I just thought that because he loved pop so much it would be a nice idea to put a portrait of him within the frame of a pop song . ''
