In spite of its title , this song should probably be called `` Bad Girl '' , or latterly `` Bad Girl Made Good '' .
Debelle had a difficult childhood , abandoned by her father and strained relations with her mother which led to her leaving home , living in hostels , and at times doing things she did n't ought to have in order to keep her head above water.This is her worm 's eye view of urban underclass youth accompanied by bass , acoustic guitar and drums .
