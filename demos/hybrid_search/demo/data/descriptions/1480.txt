The Freemasons are an English dance production duo consisting of Russell Small , who previously had UK charts success as one half of the House production duo Phats & Small , and James Wiltshire .
This song was the lead single from their second studio album Shakedown 2 .
Ellis-Bextor told Digital Spy how this song first came about : `` I was working on some new material with a guy called Biff -LRB- Stannard -RRB- , who 's good friends with the Freemasons .
They sent over the instrumental to ` Heartbreak ' and we wrote the lyrics .
The single remix has changed a bit from the original demo , but it was always their song to start with . ''
English singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor was the vocalist and co-writer of this disco-stomper .
After featuring on Spiller 's 2000 smash hit `` Groovejet -LRB- If This Ai n't Love -RRB- , '' Ellis-Bextor carved out a successful solo career as the singer of such hits as `` Take Me Home -LRB- A Girl Like Me -RRB- '' and `` Murder On The Dancefloor . ''
She is the daughter of former Blue Peter presenter Janet Ellis .
Coincidentally Freemason 's previous hit single , `` When You Touch Me , '' featured the vocals of a completely unrelated singer with the same surname , in this instance Katherine Ellis .
