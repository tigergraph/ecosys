This was written from the point of view from a boyfriend who wants his girlfriend back .
In the song he says `` I watch you there through the window , '' which is basically saying that he 's watching and looking at how beautiful she is .
-LRB- thanks , Lucian - Blacksburg , VA -RRB- On the VH1 show Storytellers , Matthews mentioned that this song was written from a `` peeping toms '' perspective .
-LRB- thanks , Abby - Boise , ID -RRB- The line , `` tied up and twisted the way I 'd like to be '' could be referring to her bathrobe .
The way it 's tied and twisted in the front , like how a man 's arms would be crossed around her abdomen if he were holding her from behind .
-LRB- thanks , Colin - Seattle , WA -RRB- This song is about a voyeuristic man .
Many people misconceive it as a love song and fail to see the true meaning behind it .
-LRB- thanks , Brady - Boise , ID -RRB- Stevie Nicks performed this on a 2008 episode of the PBS show Soundstage .
Her version was later released as a single .
