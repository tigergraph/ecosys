This is a track from In Your Honor , the fifth studio album by Foo Fighters .
It appears on the second disc , which is made up of acoustic songs .
`` Norah is positively the most talented musician I 've ever been around in my life -- and that 's including some heavies , '' Grohl told Craig McLean of The Independent on Sunday about working with Jones on this track .
`` She was unbelievable .
Perfect pitch , perfect time , perfect placement , perfect playing .
We were absolutely stunned .
She did two takes and that was it .
In and out in an hour and a half .
And she was sweet as sugar , man .
Unassuming , modest and a good hang . ''
The song features American jazz-pop singer songwriter Norah Jones on piano and co-vocals .
She recalled her contribution in a 2010 interview with Billboard magazine : `` I 've been a fan of Dave Grohl 's for a long time .
He called me and I thought , ` Am I finally gon na get to rock ? '
When he sent me the track it was this beautiful bossa nova ballad so it made sense that he called me - but I was n't going to get to rock after all .
The song has a complex chord progression and it took me a minute to fish around for the right harmony , but we found it together . ''
