Don Henley told Billboard magazine on October 12 , 2007 : `` Here I am , just turned 60 .
I 'm not complaining .
I 'm thrilled and delighted .
None of us ever thought it would go on this long .
But we are a determined bunch of guys .
We take our time .
We are not afraid of the passage of time , necessarily , and we 've been sitting one out for a long time .
That is kind of what ` Waiting In The Weeds ' implies .
Again , on the surface , that 's a love song , but it 's also about this band .
We 've just been sort of waiting for some of this bad music to die down , for certain trends to go away , so that we can get out there on the dance floor again .
We are a band that knows how to bide its time , and how to wait . ''
Eagles bass player Timothy B. Schmit told us that this is one of his favorites to play live .
`` A sweet song , really , a jewel of the album , '' Schimt says of the track .
