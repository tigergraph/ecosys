This is the title track from the seventh album by British electronica/soul group , Morcheeba .
Multi-instrumentalist Ross Godfrey explained the song 's meaning : `` That 's about an ex-priest vampire bounty hunter , who goes around seeking revenge on bad guys and bandits , whose blood he drinks like lemonade .
It seemed a bit weird at first , but the more I thought about , the cooler it sounded .
It 's a strange simile , and the fact that it became the album title is even more bizarre .
But vampires are pretty hip nowadays - all those movies where the music is really loud and the characters just whisper the screenplay . ''
