Frontman Ben Gibbard told VH1 News about this relationship ditty : `` Chris -LRB- Walla , guitarist and producer -RRB- made one of my very favorite production calls on the record where he said , ` No , on this song you say everything you need to say in the first verse and the first chorus .
There is no reason to expand any further on the subject , ' and I think it works rather well because that 's about as long as that thought would go through your head .
`` Chris Walla added : `` I like that it turned out the way that it did and the length that it did .
I think that it 's pretty funny the way that it is . ''
