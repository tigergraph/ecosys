Dennis DeYoung and James Young wrote this song with Glen Burtnik , who replaced the Damn Yankees-departed Tommy Shaw in Styx for the Edge of the Century album .
Burtnik was chosen for both his guitar chops and his songwriting skills , and he wrote or co-wrote five songs on the album .
Telling us about recording the song , Burtnik said : `` We were taking forever in the studio recording the Edge of the Century album and I was bored out of my mind .
So while songs were being tweaked in the control room I would go out in the studio and play the big beautiful piano they had .
Eventually I came up with a good chunk of the music and at night I 'd go back to my Chicago apartment to work up a demo of the tune on my sequencer .
I showed what I had to Dennis DeYoung , who wrote most of the lyrics and James Young chimed in on the bridge .
It came out worthy of including on the record , so my work was done !
Now , it may be possible Dennis was writing the song about somebody , but I was just trying to get another song on a major release album . ''
This was the last single Styx released until 1997 , when they released `` Paradise '' from their live album Return to Paradise .
