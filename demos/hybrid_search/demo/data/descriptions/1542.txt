The lead single from Bat for Lashes -LRB- Natasha Khan -RRB- 's third studio album , The Haunted Man , is a piano and cello-driven imploration to a forlorn friend offering her the strength to fight the battles she is facing .
`` You 're the train that crashed my heart .
You 're the glitter in the dark .
Oh , Laura , you 're more than a superstar , '' sings Khan .
The song received its radio debut on July 22 , 2012 on Zane Lowe 's BBC Radio 1 show and was made available as an instant download to people who pre-ordered the album on iTunes .
So what inspired Khan 's lyrics about her forlorn friend ?
The night before Khan was due to meet up with Justin Parker , she threw a `` debauched '' party at her London flat , which left a close friend -LRB- not actually called Laura -RRB- broken the next day .
Khan recalled to Q magazine : `` We huddled in bed together and she was having morning-after horrors . ''
Khan composed the song with Justin Parker , the co-writer of Lana del Rey 's `` Video Games . ''
She told Mojo magazine : `` I 'd written all the other songs for the album , but the label were giving me a tough time about there not being any singles .
I did n't want to go down the obvious pop route and I noticed there were no piano ballads this time - mainly because I 'd bored myself to death doing dark , subversive piano songs .
I 'd heard the Lana Del Rey stuff and noticed the quality of the writing , and I 've always liked '70s singer-songwriter things , so I decided to ask Justin to help me write something that was more of a conventional ballad .
We worked on chord structures and other elements , winding our way around each other until we had a really strong piece of song writing . ''
