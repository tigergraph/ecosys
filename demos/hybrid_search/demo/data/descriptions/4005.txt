My Darkest Days guitarist Sal Costa penned this cut with vocalist Matt Walst .
He told the story of the song to Artist Direct : `` It 's about infidelity .
We actually wrote that song on the road .
We were in a Walmart parking lot .
I 'd written the riff a few days before , and I recorded it .
I had a hard time coming up with a melody for it .
I went over to Matt 's bunk , and I was like , ` Matt , can you come up with a melody for this ? '
He said , ` Love Crime , ' and I thought it was a wicked title .
We went from there and wrote this song about infidelity and literally being caught in a love crime .
It was really cool to see that song grow . ''
