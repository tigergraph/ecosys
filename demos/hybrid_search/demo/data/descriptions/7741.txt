This is a track from British rapper/singer Example 's third album , Playing In The Shadows .
Written over six months , the record draws on his personal experiences .
`` Then I 'd tweak it to make it for everyone , '' he told The Guardian .
`` I have developed this new technique : I get a title , and then work backwards from that .
They must tell a story , and I believe you ca n't write good dance music unless you 've done ecstasy .
Also , it 's important that you know what the song is about before you hear it , so it 's all there in the titles ; Wrong in the Head , Never Had a Day , Under the Influence , Stay Awake . ''
