This is a largely piano based track with a somewhat whimsical melody based on the well known children 's story of the three little pigs , and the wolf who huffed and puffed and blew their house down .
Whimsical melody or not , this is anything but a frivolous song , and although the words were supplied by his original lyricist Bernie Taupin , the sentiments are just as clearly Elton 's .
In the video the two men made to promote The Captain & the Kid , Elton alludes to it as the album 's drug taking song .
Earlier , in a November 2000 BBC TV interview with Michael Parkinson , he spoke candidly about his problems with drugs , alcohol and bulimia .
The line `` Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine '' could almost have come out of this confessional .
