There was quite a saga behind the creation of this song .
Earl 's first version was lost after his laptop 's hard drive crashed .
After reassembling it , the rapper decided that he hated the mixes .
`` Then it was , ` We ca n't mix this song , '' ' he told NME , ' `` you 're going to have to redo it or do a new song . '
I threw a a tantrum .
I did a new song . ''
As well as working together on early Odd Future tracks , Sweatshirt and Ocean also collaborated on the latter 's Channel Orange cut , `` Super Rich Kids . ''
Earl Sweatshirt is joined by his Odd Future colleague Frank Ocean on this track .
However , rather than Ocean 's usual crooning , The New Orleans singer-songwriter trades bars with Earl over a spare guitar , organ and drum-filled beat .
This was not the first time that Ocean has rapped on a song , he has previously spat rhymes on cuts like the online-only `` Blue Whale '' and The O.F. Tape Vol .
2 closer `` Oldie . ''
While Sweatshirt reflects on his past , relationship woes and smoking less pot , Ocean takes shots at Chris Brown referencing their February 2013 parking lot brawl as well as Breezy conspicuously staying seated while he accepted his Urban Contemporary Album Grammy at the Staples Center .
`` Forgot you do n't like it rough , I mean he called me a faggot I was just calling his bluff I mean how anal am I gon ' be When I 'm aiming my gun And why 's his mug all bloody , that was a three-on-one ?
Standing ovation and Staples I got my Grammys and gold . ''
Though the song title does n't appear in the lyrics , Ocean and Brown 's parking lot scuffle happened on a Sunday .
