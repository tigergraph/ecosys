The lead single from India.Arie 's third studio album , Testimony : Vol .
1 , Life & Relationship , was penned by the singer with Shannon Sanders and Drew Ramsey .
It achieved some moderate chart success , peaking at # 97 on the Billboard Hot 100 .
The last verse was written after watching Melissa Etheridge 's performance on the Grammy Awards , where she appeared bald from her chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer .
`` Her performance brought tears to my eyes , '' said Arie .
`` At that moment in time , her performance was a juxtaposition of pain and beauty .
It symbolized the beauty of strength . ''
A remix featuring Senegalese-American singer Akon was released to US rhythmic and urban radio formats .
Arie told Neal Conan that the remix was commercially driven and was n't her choice .
`` Some of the drum sounds , '' she said , `` the way that the bass was , the way that it was mixed , the way that it was marketed on a commercial level .
But I 'm happy that - in hindsight , I 'm happy I did it because it reached more people , you know ? ''
The song was originally intended to be a duet between Arie and the R&B singer and Pop-Rocker Pink .
It was rooted in the latter 's decision to do away with her pink locks .
`` We both had something to say with this song , and we wanted to work together , '' Arie explained to Billboard magazine .
`` This duet should have been the original version on my album , but it fell through the cracks . ''
This version was made available on iTunes on October 17 , 2006 , and was used in the Lifetime television film Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastectomy .
India explained to Neal Conan on NPR 's Talk Of The Nation in a 2013 interview that as well as being about hair , the lyrics also go a deeper level .
`` It 's about dogmatic self-definition , '' she explained , `` and on the other hand self-definition and not allowing anyone to define you based on their parameters , you know ? ''
