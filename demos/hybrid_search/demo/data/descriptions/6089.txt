This is a song with which everyone who has ever had a broken romance will identify .
Although he could shred with the best of them , `` Empty Rooms '' is basically a slow bluesy type track , and is widely regarded as Moore 's greatest guitar solo .
It was co-written in 1984 with keyboard player/guitarist Neil Carter , who said the vocal track was originally laid down by Glenn Hughes - one-time bass player with Deep Purple - but this `` obviously never made it out of the studio '' .
Of the track itself , Carter said `` I always joke that song has bought my house , but I suppose it probably has over the years ! ''
In Happy Together , an interview with Gary Moore and Phil Lynott by Derek Oliver published in a May 1985 issue of Kerrang !
, Moore said of this song , it is `` very personal .
It was n't written because I felt sorry for myself , it was something I went through at one time - something that everyone goes through at one stage or another '' .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 3 -RRB- `` Empty Rooms '' was released as a single in both seven inch and twelve inch formats , although the radio edit really does n't do it justice .
Gary Moore died suddenly in Spain on February 6 , 2011 aged only fifty-eight , leaving more than a mere room empty , but also leaving us many fine live recordings of this rock classic .
