In 1999 Shepherd tragically lost her brother Jeff in a car accident .
This song finds her recalling Rory Dunigan , who was his best friend when he was growing up .
She explained to The Boot : `` I dedicated my first record to my brother , who was killed in a car accident in 1999 .
I did n't have any songs on the album about him , but I did dedicate the record to him .
Rory and Jeff were almost the same person , that 's how close they were .
This song reflects back on us riding and listening to Rory 's radio growing up , and remembering my brother .
It 's really special to me and that it made the record .
I pushed for it . ''
