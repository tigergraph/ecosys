Ellie Goulding recorded this piano ballad for the Richard Curtis-directed British romantic comedy movie About Time .
The simple proclamation of undying love is a cover of a Waterboys track that originally appeared on their 1990 album , Room to Roam .
The song was released as the official 2013 Children in Need single .
Speaking of her involvement , Goulding said : `` I 've grown up watching BBC Children in Need so it 's fantastic that I 'm doing this year 's single !
It is an emotional song , but in a really positive way , and I 've been completely blown away with the positive reaction it 's had already . ''
The video features a montage of excerpts from Richard Curtis 's well-known rom-coms Love Actually , Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral as well as clips from About Time .
