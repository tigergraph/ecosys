This youth-hymn is the second single by The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers , from his debut studio album , Flamingo .
The song was produced by Stuart Price , who was also the man behind the desk on The Killers third record , Day & Age .
Flowers told MSN Music : `` That was the song I had the most reservations about even though I think it could be the best song on the album - it 's the most different song .
It 's the only one that 's got sequenced drums - everything else is live drums . ''
