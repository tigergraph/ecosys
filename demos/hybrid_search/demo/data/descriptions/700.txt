`` Roots '' was written by Steve Knightley ; according to Emma Hartley writing in the Daily Telegraph blog of January 11 , 2009 , its inspiration was `` a daft remark made by Kim Howells MP in 2001 , while he was a culture minister , that listening to three folk singers in a pub in Somerset was his idea of hell . ''
The song actually alludes to this statement .
Race aside , `` Roots '' is about loss of identity in a world of urban sprawl , mind-numbing soap operas , and equally mind-numbing music where people are famous for being famous .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 3 -RRB- Like many songs , `` Roots '' was subject to both reinterpretation and misinterpretation .
For reasons that had more to do with racially taboo ideologies than folk music , the British National Party identified with it strongly , and began plugging it on their website .
Although Knightley and Show of Hands were not happy about this , they were told there was little that could be done to prevent it .
