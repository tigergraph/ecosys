Singer Ben Bridwell -LRB- from The Skinny -RRB- said of this mid-tempo rocker : `` I 'm always wrong about what 's going to be the first single and I thought that this would be a good one to at least leak to blogs and s -- t like that because it 's just so upbeat and a bit different for us .
It has a doo-wop feel which is a new horizon for Band of Horses . ''
