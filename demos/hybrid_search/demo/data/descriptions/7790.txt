This is the first single from Scream , the tenth studio album by English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne .
It is Ozzy 's first release to feature new guitarist Gus G. -LRB- Firewind -RRB- .
The album 's original title was Soul Sucka , but following negative feedback from fans , Ozzy published a list of other possible names and asked fans to vote .
They eventually decided on Scream .
The single was premiered in the US on an episode of CSI : NY , which was broadcast on April 14 , 2010 .
`` We were looking for something high energy and irreverent to sell the madness of a prison riot , '' said executive producer and episode writer Peter M. Lenkov about the use of the song .
`` We immediately responded to the new Osbourne tune .
The song exceeded our expectations and brought exactly the right tone to the episode .
`` Ozzy , who spent time in prison in the UK for burglary before his 18th birthday said : `` When I heard they were going to use ` Let Me Hear You Scream ' for a prison riot scene , I thought , ` Well , now that 's something I know about . ' ''
Gus G told Musicradar.com about recording his solo for this song : `` Let Me Hear You Scream was written quite a few times .
The lyrics kept changing , the riffs kept changing , the arrangement changed back and forth .
Originally , I did a whammy pedal solo , only I do n't really know how to use a whammy pedal .
So I did some crazy s -- t with high octaves , which sounded OK .
But then the lyrics changed again , so I had to think of another type of solo - that 's the one that ended up on the final recording . ''
