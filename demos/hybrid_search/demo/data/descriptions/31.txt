This song received some airplay , but it was not a commercial success .
Talk Show was essentially Stone Temple Pilots with a different vocalist .
Dean DeLeo -LRB- guitar -RRB- , Robert DeLeo -LRB- bass -RRB- , and Eric Kretz -LRB- drums -RRB- were joined by former Ten Inch Men vocalist Dave Coutts .
-LRB- thanks , Ricky - Houston , TX , for above 2 -RRB-
