Written on a trip to California with Joan Baez , Mimi Fariña -LRB- Joan 's Sister -RRB- , and Richard Fariña , this song , along with `` Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carrol , '' was the only other reported song on this trip .
It 's first live performance was with Joan Baez struggling to sing harmony .
The song 's melody closely resembles the Folk standard `` The Water is Wide . ''
This song was recorded as a demo for `` Times They Are A-Changin , '' Dylan 's 1964 release , but was cut from the album .
Dylan performed this both nights at his famous Carnegie Hall concert in 1963 .
-LRB- thanks , Zach - Sanbornville , NH , for all above -RRB-
