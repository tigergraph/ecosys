This track was written by Posner on his way back to Detroit for a show after having spent five months in Los Angeles .
It is named after the Delta 1406 flight that the singer was on when he penned it .
Posner talks openly to his parents on the song .
He told The Beatweek that it 's a reflection of what he was dealing with at the time and such honesty is vital .
Said Posner : `` Everything I write is true , and that 's the only reason I 've gotten this far in my career is that my listeners know that when I say something in a song , it 's real to me .
That makes the music real to them . ''
