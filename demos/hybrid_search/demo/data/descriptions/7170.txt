Lee Brice : `` I had dinner with a bunch of writers and publishers in Nashville and somebody raised a glass and said , ` Here 's to a night you wo n't remember , and the friends we wo n't forget . '
I thought , ` Wow , ' and I started looking around to see if anybody else caught that , and I plugged it into my phone .
Then I got with Rob -LSB- Hatch -RSB- and Lance -LSB- Miller -RSB- , two of my best friends and co-writers , and we sat down and wrote that song .
All of those images are right from where I 'm from .
And right from where most Country music listeners come from . ''
