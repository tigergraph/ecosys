Bassist John Taylor told the story of this song in a blog on Duran Duran 's website : `` It began life as a bassline and loop brought in by Mark -LRB- Ronson , producer -RRB- , in which he referenced NY post-punk bands ESG and Liquid-Liquid .
Fantastic fun to play .
At first Simon 's vocal ideas were deemed too Happy Mondays-ish .
The groove sat around for months , in my iTunes , called simply ` New York Minute ' .
Simon had to go back to the drawing board on this one several times until he came up with the concept of ` Safe -LRB- in the heat of the moment -RRB- ' .
But once he sang the basis of ` Safe ' , we all jumped on it , hungry as we were to have the energy that this song has in spades on the album . ''
The song features a vocal contribution by Ana Matronic .
Taylor discussed the hook up with the Scissor Sisters singer -LRB- try saying that quickly ! -RRB-
: `` We added back-up vocalists on the chorus -LRB- just a little bit Bee Gees -RRB- and then a moment of genius : Ana from Scissor Sisters spent an evening with the track in the company of Nick -LRB- Rhodes -RRB- and Mark -LRB- Ronson -RRB- , and what did we get ?
A brilliant rap-tastic girl power moment . ''
