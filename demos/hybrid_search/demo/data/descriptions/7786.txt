This Dreamlab and Peter Thomas produced song features Spanish and Reggae influences .
Selena Gomez said during a hour-long livestream that as she gets to travel a lot , she wanted to share an island vibe with her fans : `` I wanted a Spanish vibe , but a little bit of a Reggae style .
It 'll make you feel like you want to go to Jamaica or South America . ''
The chorus and the beginning of song are taken from Jamaican Dancehall artist Buju Banton 's `` Champion , '' which is a track on his 1995 album Til Shiloh .
Gomez adopts a Rihanna-esque island patois in the song , as well as borrowing the Barbadian star 's lyric `` shine like diamonds in the sky . ''
