This is a track from Contemporary Christian Music singer songwriter Phil Wickham 's third studio album , Heaven and Earth .
The album has the theme of The Church 's hope in heaven .
This piano-driven tune was the starting point of the project .
Wickham explained to CCM Magazine : `` There 's a chapter called ` Naked ' in Searching for God Knows What by Donald Miller .
It 's Miller 's take on this unobstructed relationship Adam had with God .
There was complete security , love and humility .
Nothing to hide behind , nothing to be ashamed of .
I wanted to sing a song called ` Eden , ' about how the longing that Adam and Eve felt after they left the garden has been passed on from generation to generation .
There 's still a need in our hearts for a relationship with God .
I wanted to end the story in the new hope we have in heaven .
I read some books and looked up Bible verses that gave glimpses of heaven , and -LSB- I -RSB- started getting a real excitement about this place where we 're gon na be , this Kingdom of God .
And I knew that Jesus , His death and resurrection , needed to be right in the middle of the story , bringing heaven and earth together .
Now I have this message to remind the Church what we are living for and what our hope is in . ''
