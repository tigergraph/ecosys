This is the title track of the Tucson , Arizona based Americana/Alternative Country band Calexico 's seventh studio LP .
The album was named for , inspired by and recorded in the Algiers District of New Orleans .
In our interview with Calexico frontman Joey Burns , he explained how they drew inspiration from the location : `` The studio , which is called The Living Room Studio , is a beautiful building .
It 's an old , all-wood Baptist church from the 1930s .
The environment , the space , the tone really helped inspire the way we played and the way we wrote , and then ultimately the way things were recorded down to tape .
This wooden room is different from the rooms where we write and record in Tucson , where the foundation is mostly concrete .
Having that wood floor really helped bring out a lot of interesting tones -- especially the drums and the upright bass and the organ .
It was great .
And being in that different kind of space , it had an effect for me on writing .
Not everyone can go somewhere to write and record .
Most bands already have material ready and go in and get it done as quickly as possible .
We allowed ourselves about 10 days to go down there and see what we could come up with , and as soon as we got there , ideas just started pouring out . ''
