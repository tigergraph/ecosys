Alex Turner told the NME that this was not originally going to be on the album : `` There 's a song on the album called ` Separate and Ever Deadly , ' which we actually did in London after the original sessions .
We thought it was going to be a B-side , but when we 'd finished it we knew it had to replace this other track because we 're dead excited about it .
I think that 's good , because if we had done it all in France it might feel like a fluke couple of weeks .
It 's good that we 've got that one because it means hopefully we 'll do more in the future . ''
