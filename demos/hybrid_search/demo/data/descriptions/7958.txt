On this album closer , Cook sings of his desire to , `` kill the blinding lights of day . ''
The singer 's life changed after winning American Idol and losing his older brother to cancer .
`` The world around me got a little loud , so there were mornings where I woke up and it was just like , ` OK , I just need to stay in bed and try again tomorrow , ' '' Cook told MTV News .
The album title comes from a line in this song -- `` Give me one more quiet night , before this loud morning gets it right , and does me in . ''
In an interview with AINow.org Cook explained he wanted This Loud Morning to have a loose theme that is open to interpretation by the listener .
He described the opening track `` Circadian '' as using sleep as a means of escaping life , and this track being about waking up from a dream and having to face actual reality .
Rapid eye movement sleep is a normal stage of sleep characterized by the random movement of the eyes .
It typically occupies about a quarter of total sleep , and during a normal night of shut-eye , humans usually experience about four or five periods of REM sleep .
Vividly recalled dreams mostly occur during this stage .
