This is Groban 's interpretation of a Portuguese song written by two Brazilians - the lyricist Lester Mendez and arranger Carlinhos Brown - in the latter 's Bahia home .
Groban had worked with Mendez before when duetting on `` Silencio '' from Nelly Furtado 's 2009 Spanish-language album Mi Plan .
Groban sings in several different languages on Illuminations , including Italian , Latin and French , though this was his first time in Portuguese .
`` I study all these languages - I really do my homework , '' Groban told Billboard magazine of his ability to sound natural in multiple tongues .
`` There was a time when I would try to translate these songs into English , and things would get lost in translation both lyrically and musically .
And it 's also been fun for me to sing songs in these languages in the countries of their origin and reach out to fans that way , and maybe even encourage some fans to learn other languages . ''
The song features an all-girl drum corps -- the only drums on Illuminations .
