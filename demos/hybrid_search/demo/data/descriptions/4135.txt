This Dance-Pop track originated with a demo sent by British songwriter Dev Hynes -LRB- Solange 's `` Losing You , '' Mutya Keisha Siobhan 's `` Flatline '' -RRB- which was inspired by a failed relationship ; Ferreira then modified the original lyrics and structure along with her producer Ariel Rechtshaid .
Ferreria and Hynes had been friends but the pair fell out over comments she made as to whose song it was .
Ferreira told The Guardian : `` He wrote the demo , and I 've always given him credit , all I said was that the song would n't have been made without me on it .
I think it 's a shame because Dev 's really talented and he 's my friend .
Well , was my friend -- it 's kinda sad that we ca n't be -LSB- friends -RSB- now . ''
The track was critically acclaimed , with several publications and music blogs listing it among their favorites of 2012 .
New York magazine named it the best song of the year saying it , `` has feathery grace and weary melodies , magic and sparkle , and feels as warm as curling up next to the radiator on a cold day . ''
The song was released as a single in the UK on April 14 , 2013 and included on the 2013 Now That 's What I Call Music !
46 compilation album in the US .
Ferreira sung this on her debut television performance , during the January 7 , 2013 episode of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon .
