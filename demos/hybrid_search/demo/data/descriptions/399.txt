This track tells the tragic story of the Haran family from Nahariya , Israel .
It was uploaded to Oh , Sleeper 's Facebook page on the August 23 , 2011 .
Guitarist Shane Blay explained the background to the song in an interview with Alternative Press magazine : `` On April 22 , 1979 , this family was murdered in a terrorist attack led by Samir Kuntar , a former member of the Palestine Liberation Front .
The only survivor of this attack was the mother , Smadar .
While her husband and one of her daughters were being kidnapped and eventually murdered , Smadar hid with her two-year-old daughter Yael in a crawl space above a bedroom in their apartment .
Yael was accidentally suffocated in an attempt to quiet her from crying out and revealing their hiding spot .
So this song was born out of that tragedy .
We decided that my singing would be the voice of the mother whispering to Yael in those last moments , and Micah -LSB- Kinard -RSB- 's voice would be the narrator of the tragic tale .
Needless to say , this song is emotional and we were glad to be able to bring this story to our fans . ''
