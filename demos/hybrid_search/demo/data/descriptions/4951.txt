This is a track from American singer-songwriter David Archuleta 's first Christmas album , Christmas From The Heart .
Archuleta sings part of this in French - it was the first time that the 18-year-old singer had spoken the language .
USA Today , noting the album 's credits include a pronunciation assistant for this song , asked David if she was in the studio with him .
He replied : `` No .
We were just like , ` These are French lyrics .
I do n't speak them , and I do n't think I 'm saying them right . '
My keyboardist 's friend spoke French , so the night before , we just called her and said , ` Hey !
Can you help me with these words ? '
She just went over them on the phone with me , and I was , like , ` Thank you , because I 'm going to have to record them in the morning . '
It was pretty funny .
It was someone I had known already , but I guess they were my coach for the day . ''
This traditional minor-key carol is basically a French version of the Little Drummer Boy story .
The song revolves around the birth of Jesus Christ , and is told from the perspective of shepherds playing simple instruments -- flutes and drums .
The onomatopoetic title , `` patapan , '' is meant to mimic the sound of the drum , and an accompanying lyric , `` tu-re-lu-re-lu , '' the flute .
American composer and arranger Kurt Bestor did the arrangement , with The Prague Philharmonic strings enriching its melody .
Archuleta told USA Today : `` We were trying to give it a more contemporary feel , a more modernized thing .
It 's hard , because it 's a pretty short song .
They actually had to add to the song and make it an original arrangement of the song .
I really like how it came out .
Kurt did a great job with it . ''
