George Cole , author of The Last Miles : The Music of Miles Davis , 1980-1991 , explains : `` When Miles was recording the Tutu album , producer Tommy LiPuma thought the album needed a cover version , so he gave Miles lots of pop albums to listen to -- Miles selected Scritti Politti 's ` Perfect Way . '
In fact , Miles liked the tune so much , that he originally planned to make it the title track .
Miles later became friends with singer Green Gartside and played on the Scritti Politti track ` Oh Patti . '
He even appeared in the music video .
I have to admit that the album version of ` Perfect Way ' is not one of my most favorite of Miles 's tunes and the rather mechanical rhythm track restricts what Miles can do with it .
However , the live version was more fluid and included a nice call-and-response section featuring Miles and the bass player . ''
