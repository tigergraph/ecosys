In July 2009 Taylor moved out of her family home into a 1.9 million dollar condo in Nashville , Tennessee .
This song switches from a lullaby addressed to a young child to Taylor feeling alone as she spends her first night in her new apartment of her own .
The song has an undercurrent of sadness as she reflects on the innocence of the young .
Taylor -LRB- from her website -RRB- : '' ` Never Grow Up ' is a song about the fact that I do n't quite know how I feel about growing up .
It 's tricky .
Growing up happens without you knowing it .
Growing up is such a crazy concept because a lot of times when you were younger you wish you were older .
I look out into a crowd every night and I see a lot of girls that are my age and going through exactly the same things as I 'm going through .
Every once in a while I look down and I see a little girl who is seven or eight , and I wish I could tell her all of this .
There she is becoming who she is going to be and forming her thoughts and dreams and opinions .
I wrote this song for those little girls . ''
