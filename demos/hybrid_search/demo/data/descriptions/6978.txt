The lyrics deal with the Nazis and The Holocaust .
`` Waiting to turn on the showers and fire the ovens '' refers to the Nazi death camps .
The lyrics also mention the people the Nazis killed : `` Waiting for the queens and the coons and the reds and the Jews . ''
-LRB- thanks , m - new york , NY -RRB- Toni Tennille of The Captain & Tennille and Bruce Johnston of The Beach Boys contributed backup vocals .
The original plan was to have all members of the Beach Boys harmonize on `` The Show Must Go On '' and `` Waiting for the Worms , '' but the idea was scrapped .
