The song features the vocals of frontman James Mercer .
The other musicians are guitarists Californian singer-songwriter Nik Freitas and producer Greg Kurstin , bassist Ron Lewis who was a member of the band between 2009 and 2011 and current stickman Joe Plummer , formerly of Modest Mouse on drums .
Mercer told UK newspaper The Independent about the songwriting process for Port of Morrow .
`` I 'm responsible for the songs , '' he said .
`` I write the songs , I write the lyrics , I come up with the big ideas .
From that point on it 's a collaboration .
Greg -LSB- Kurstin -RSB- co-produced it , he put it together , he figured out the overall aesthetic and how these songs will be presented .
And Nik -LSB- Freitas -RSB- , who plays a bunch of guitar on the record , was hugely influential on its sound .
There are a lot of great hooks that he just came up with on the spot . ''
