The opening creepy laugh in this song -LRB- which pans left and right in the speakers -RRB- is a sample from the bartender scene in Clint Eastwood 's movie A Fistful of Dollars .
Other movie clips in the song are from Platoon -LRB- `` Come on , motherf -- kers ! '' -RRB-
, Aliens -LRB- `` Die , Motherf -- ker ! '' -RRB-
and The Good , the Bad and the Ugly -LRB- `` You know what you are ? '' -RRB- .
Regarding his habit of sampling movies , Al Jourgensen of Ministry told us : `` The thing is with sampling , you have to be creative .
You ca n't just use the obvious , or something that 's going to get you in legal trouble .
When we first started sampling , there were no rules .
It was like the Wild West .
So I could sample off Apocalypse Now and Platoon and all this other stuff that I had , obvious stuff .
But then you had to start getting a little more clever , because lawyers get involved .
And lawyers suck . ''
