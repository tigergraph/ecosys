Frontman Ben Gibbard explained this track to VH1 News , which is centered around the 2007 wildfires that raged in California : `` I was in LA , after we were there for the Grammys or something like that and I decided to stay a couple more days .
I ended up with a couple friends of mine , Jonathan Rice and our friend Autumn de Wilde who 's a great photographer , and her daughter .
It 's a very literal story .
We were having some wine and having a picnic on top of this big cascading hill with the ocean off in the distance , and at the time there were a lot of fears about these fires creeping down from the grapevine .
This was a very real moment , just seeing her daughter , playing in this cemetery .
It struck me as this really powerful image of a child playing in a cemetery , not having any understanding of what this area means .
It was a really interesting example of youth having a way with death . ''
The song 's animated music video features the Death Cab band members making a cartoon cameo in the background loading a van as wildfires approach .
Death Cab bassist Nick Harmer who handles the `` visual stuff '' for the band , explained to MTV News : `` I 'm a huge comic book fan , so there was that .
Plus , in my head , I could n't see any kind of live-action video that would n't come off as heavy-handed or overwrought .
So we knew what we did n't want it to be .
Plus , we knew we should do a cameo , which meant we 'd get to be animated , so that was a bonus . ''
