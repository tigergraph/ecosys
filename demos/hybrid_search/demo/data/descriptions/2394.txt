This schooldays recollection was the first single to be released from Which Bitch ? .
Bassist Kieran Webster explained the album title to The Sun February 6 , 2009 : `` We 're always being asked by girls we know and girlfriends if our songs are about them .
Kyle can never remember so the title means `` Which bitch am I singing about in this song ? ''
Kyle Falconer -LRB- vocals/guitar -RRB- -LRB- from The View Are On Fire -RRB- : `` That 's me getting five different characters and making them into one character .
It 's loads of girls from my school in loads of different scenarios .
It 's sort of an educational thing about a teenager going through school .
It 's all about the smokey teachers , petty things , but the lassie 's a junkie .
It 's just saying do n't do drugs -LRB- laughs -RRB- .
That was written at the end of our first tour with Babyshambles .
We never really got round to finishing it 'cause we were touring so much and then once we got a bit of time , we just belted it out .
Is it easy to write on the road ?
Nah , it 's pretty hard actually .
On the last tour , we were coming up with different tunes every night but just never remembering them the next day . ''
