The lyrics of this song were written by Anthony Kiedis and portray sex in a variety of lively and explicit yet metaphorically driven and spiritual ways .
According to Kiedis ' autobiography Scar Tissue , several of the lyrics were written about him and his girlfriend of the time .
This song is one of the heaviest on the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik .
A characteristic fat drum beat drives the intro and verses and a similarly powerful beat features in the chorus , with multiple bass drum accents and a heavy-hitting feel .
A very dark wah-wah ridden guitar riff and bass chords -LRB- one of the few examples in RHCP music -RRB- complement the verse beat and crescendo into an extremely heavy , almost wall of sound melody in the chorus .
Kiedis ' low lyrics and contrasting lively chorus complement the dynamics as well .
-LRB- thanks , Charles - Edmonton , Canada -RRB-
