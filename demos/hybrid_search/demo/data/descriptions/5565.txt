American Country music artist Trace Adkins is a doting father of five daughters , -LRB- Tarah , Sarah , Mackenzie , Brianna , Trinity -RRB- and in the first single from his tenth studio album , he sings about spending time with his girls . ''
` Just Fishin ' , ' sounds like it 's some redneck thing , but it 's a song about a father going fishing with his little girl , and she thinks it 's just fishin ' , but it 's about much more than that , '' Adkins told The Boot .
`` As a father of daughters , it hit all the right buttons .
I 've taught all my girls to fish , and it 's about the lessons that you learn from teaching your children to fish .
It 's the time that you spend together doing it .
That 's what 's really important . ''
The song 's music video was filmed on Adkins ' property south of Nashville and features his youngest daughter .
Adkins had put his other daughters in other videos , and felt it was Trinity 's turn to be in one .
The Casey Beathard , Monty Criswell and Ed Hill penned tune was originally earmarked to be the lead single from Adkins ' Cowboy 's Back In Town album .
`` The folks at -LSB- my label -RSB- Show Dog-Universal wanted it to be the first single , and I said no , '' he explained to The Boot .
`` I had just come off of ` You 're Gon na Miss This , ' and this song is very much in the same vein .
I said , ' I do n't want those songs that close together .
We need to spread them out . '
I knew that if I put that song on this album , they would really want to release it too early .
So I kept it . ''
