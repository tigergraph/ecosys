Dave Grohl : `` Breakout started off almost as a joke , just a play on the word and taking the piss out of your typical tortured romance love story .
It 's supposed to seem kind of ridiculous because I ca n't imagine anyone wanting to break off a relationship just because they have acne . ''
The music video takes place at a drive-in movie theater showing Me , Myself , And Irene and features 3 ' 6 '' actor Tony Cox , who appeared in the film .
in the video for `` Breakout , '' the song `` Generator , '' also from There Is Nothing Left To Lose , can be heard .
-LRB- thanks , john - bensalems , PA -RRB- This song was on the soundtrack of Me , Myself And Irene .
Dave Grohl is good friends with Jim Carrey , who starred in the movie .
While recording this song , the band had to tell Dave Grohl to tone it down because the neighbors were giving dirty looks and threatening to complain about the noise .
-LRB- Thanks , Bert - Pueblo , NM , for all above .
