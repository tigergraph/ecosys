Frontman Anders SG told Digital Spy about this song : `` There are not many people who understand the story , but I 'm going to tell you anyway .
It 's actually inspired by a Swedish film about two lesbians .
They 're teenagers and it 's a story about them discovering love and how they feel about other girls .
In school they get teased by the other kids and then they decide , ` F -- k everyone , we 're going to do this .
We do n't care what you think ' .
That 's what the song 's about - not caring what other people think about your boyfriend or girlfriend . ''
This was originally recorded in 2007 for the Danish release of This is Alphabeat , but the band re-recorded it before they released it in the UK .
Anders SG told Digital Spy that this was the one song they really wanted to alter , because they did n't like the original production .
He added : `` We worked on it and now it sounds a lot more how we imagined it .
It 's possibly our favourite track on the album now . ''
