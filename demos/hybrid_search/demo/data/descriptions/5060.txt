This is a single from Christian pop/rock band , BarlowGirl 's fifth studio album , Love & War .
Alyssia Barlow , who penned the song , explained its meaning and message to NewReleaseTuesday : `` The song really came about in a moment in my life where I was in a season of difficulty .
Following God is amazing , and I would n't trade it for anything in the world .
Following God comes with ups and downs .
I was in an uncertain season .
I know God 's promises and what God has put on my heart , but I was n't seeing God 's promises being fulfilled and I was very uncomfortable .
I was telling myself that I 'm done with this valley and ready for the mountaintop .
There was this day when I was writing for the album and I was struggling personally .
I was journaling about wanting God to sing a love song over me .
I wanted to hear God singing over my life.I was picturing a mother and father singing a love song over their child while rocking them to sleep .
God does sing over us songs that tell us what He thinks about us .
David in the Psalms writes about wanting to know God 's thoughts about him .
In that moment in my journey , I realized that I do n't know the outcome of my journey but if I feel God 's heart towards me , I have security .
My security does n't come from knowing the answers or the destination but from knowing God 's love for me .
That moment was what inspired the song . ''
