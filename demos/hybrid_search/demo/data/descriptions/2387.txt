This is the lead single from the self-titled fourth studio album by New York post-punk rock band Interpol .
The song , which lyrically measures out the distance between people who should be close , debuted at # 39 on Billboard Alternative Songs , the group 's fourth appearance on that chart .
The song 's music video was filmed at Floyd Bennett Airfield in Brooklyn , and directed by Moh Azima .
It consists of guitarist Daniel Kessler and drummer Sam Fogarino playing in front of mirrors , while vocalist Paul Banks sings in front of a projector .
The clip 's concept is that you can project images on pretty much everything , including women .
