Tyga and his team were certainly careless when they failed to clear a sample of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 's `` I Have a Dream '' speech with MLK 's estate for this track .
Consequently , approximately 150,000 copies of Careless World : Rise of the Last King were pulled from stores just before it was released on February 21 2012 and new albums , with the MLK speech removed , were quickly shipped as replacements .
The mishap cost Tyga a significant percentage of his first-week takings with his sales tally coming mainly from digital outlets .
`` I felt like a lot of my fans and some of the younger generation know of Martin Luther King , but they do n't really understand his struggle or what he did and the message he was trying to give to younger people like myself , '' Tyga explained on MTV 's RapFix Live .
`` Me knowing that is why I used the phrase on that song , and I really wanted that part on the song .
It was , like , 10 seconds .
If I thought it was gon na jeopardize my first-week sales , I would n't have used it .
I used it because I wanted the message to get out . ''
