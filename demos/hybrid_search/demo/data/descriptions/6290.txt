Newsted is a Metal band led by former Metallica bass player Jason Newsted , who is joined by guitar players Jessie Farnsworth and Mike Mushok , and drummer Jesus Mendez Jr. .
Jason wrote the song , which he told us is about `` standing up for what you believe in , and being willing to give your life for what you believe in . ''
The lyric was inspired by Pat Tillman , a football player for the Arizona Cardinals who left the sport in the prime of his career to join the Army in 2002 .
He was killed in Afghanistan , in what was later determined to be friendly fire .
Said Newsted : `` He was a gifted person ; always could jump higher and run faster than everybody and wanted to use those abilities to protect what he believed in . ''
This song spread in very grass roots fashion .
Someone Jason Newsted knew from his Metallica days gave a copy of it to the influential Metal journalist Eddie Trunk , who played it on his syndicated radio show .
The positive response convinced the band to release the track as part of a 4-song EP called Metal on iTunes .
A few months later , the full album was released , all without any traditional marketing .
Jason Newsted resisted digital recording technology for a long time , but when his wife gave him her old iPad with an early version of GarageBand installed , it became his preferred method for writing songs , as it was much more convenient than his Tascam tape machine .
Certain riffs come suddenly to Newsted , and when this one hit , he had the iPad ready .
Said Jason : '' ` Soldierhead ' was one of those that the riff came right away .
It just showed up , and I got it on my iPad , that first quick riff , and started building from there .
The composition probably came together in less than an hour on the iPad as far as the puzzle pieces . ''
