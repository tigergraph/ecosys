Fiona called this backwards love ballad , `` thinking about how did I get here , '' at a showcase for The MF Life in New York .
It is one of a number of tracks on the album , in which she sings of heartache .
Fiona wrote the songs when she was in the middle of a happy relationship , which later ended .
She explained to The Boombox : `` I actually wrote all the songs that I ended up living , before I lived them , which is really crazy .
I found myself with all the records that I wrote in succession and they actually told the story of what happened in that relationship .
I was in the relationship and at the time ; I did n't foresee it ending . ''
According to the NY Post the guy whom Fiona was dating whilst writing the songs for the album was CSI : Miami actor Adam Rodriguez .
The couple were in a relationship for three years before splitting while the Canadian singer was recording The MF Life .
Asked by The Boombox how she can write from a place of heartbreak when in a happy relationship , Fiona replied : `` I think that subconsciously our emotions get the best of us even though we consciously do n't necessarily recognize them .
For me - frustration , sadness , despair , anger - these are the things that help me write my best music because I feel that I 'm a positive person overall .
My outlet to express that darker side of me is through my music .
I do n't necessarily have to live that everyday but it 's therapeutic for me to get it out .
Oddly enough , it 's not just me , the singles that become the hits are the ones that people choose .
It seems that there are a lot of people going through heartbreak and just need a voice to help them say it .
You live and you learn .
I moved on from ` It Kills Me ' and now , we 'll get through ` Wrong Side of a Love Song . ' ''
