This is a cover of a Tom Waits song , which originally featured on his 1999 Mule Variations album .
It 's not the first time that Stewart has recorded one of the American Rock musician 's tunes .
`` I do n't know what it is about Tom Waits that suits me , '' he told The Sun . '' ''
` Downtown Train ' was a hit for me in 1989 and that was one of his too .
I 've never ever met him either !
And I 've loved ` Picture In A Frame ' for a long time .
So does -LRB- Rod 's wife -RRB- Penny .
`` And I 've always done and am known for my covers .
It 's very gratifying and satisfying to do them . ''
