This is the second single from American Country music group Love and Theft 's debut album , World Wide Open .
The song was penned by band member Stephen Barker Liles together with co-producer Robert Ellis Orrall and Nashville songwriter Roger Springer .
Liles told Roughstock how the song came to be written : `` I was in Robert Ellis Orrall 's office and Roger Springer called .
He had written a lot of hits for Mark Chesnutt and others and was saying , ` I 'm coming back into town to write .
I 've been out a couple of years . '
So Robert said , ` Come on over . '
He came in with the line ' I do n't understand why we do what we do to each other , ' and we just looked at each other and said , ` Yeah , let 's go with that . '
We wrote it fast . ''
