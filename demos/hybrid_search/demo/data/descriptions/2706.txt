This song features British singer-songwriter and winner of the inaugural Pop Idol , Will Young .
Groove Armada 's Tom Findlay told Q magazine about it : `` History was a song of Will Young 's and it 's probably about love .
We added a backing track that looked backwards rather than forwards .
It 's very Bronski Beat Smalltown Boy .
Basically it 's the exact same chords if you want to get me into trouble for it -LSB- laughs -RSB- .
It 's just the way things are that it 's hard to come up with something truly original . ''
