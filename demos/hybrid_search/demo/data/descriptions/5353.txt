A lot of people thought Lightfoot wrote this about his wife .
In an April 1975 Crawdaddy magazine article , he explained : `` All it is , is a thought about a situation where someone is wondering what his live one is doing at the moment .
He does n't quite know where she is .
He 's not ready to give up on her , either , and that 's about all I got to say about that . ''
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England -RRB- Lightfoot most likely wrote this about the stormy relationship with his one time girlfriend Cathy Smith , who was later sentenced for delivering a lethal dose of heroin to John Belushi .
