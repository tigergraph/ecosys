Monsters of Folk are an alternative rock band comprising of Jim James of My Morning Jacket , Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis of Bright Eyes , and indie singer-songwriter M. Ward .
This song has lyrics that reference the famous Tootsie Pops ad campaign where a boy asks how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop .
Mogis explained to Express Night Out : `` I know -LSB- Jim -RSB- talked about this and I cant quite remember , so I do n't want to put words in his mouth , but I think it dealt with a human condition kind of thing , getting to the heart of something basically .
It has this kind of similar sentiment to some of the other songs that deal with a question and the human condition , like this constant need for things and yearning and searching for stuff .
And the Tootsie Pop reference is one of those things : getting to the prize , what do you have to do to get to that point . ''
