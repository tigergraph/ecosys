This is a track from American singer-songwriter Josh Ritter 's sixth album , So Runs the World Away .
He told Express Night Out about the song : `` It 's a song about being on a train and not knowing where you 're gon na go , but knowing you 're gon na meet your destiny out there .
It 's an intense song - it 's about rolling past the predators in the night .
Where I grew up , trains would go through towns at all hours .
I 'd get to see them roll right by the grade school where I went to school .
The -LRB- school -RRB- field ended at the train tracks and the trains would go all over the place - New Orleans , Albuquerque , all these incredible places I wanted to see . ''
