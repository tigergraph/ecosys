This song draws on Christopher 's brother 's experiences serving in Basra , Iraq .
He told the Metro newspaper July 7 , 2008 : `` I was thinking about why he was there and if it 's the right thing to do .
It 's a song wondering why we 're on the planet . ''
This featured in the final episode -LRB- `` Losing My Mind '' -RRB- of season 4 of Grey 's Anatomy .
Bryn Christopher told The Sun September 4 , 2008 about this song : '' -LRB- Bryn 's brother -RRB- Tyler had just been sent to Iraq .
He was fighting for this country but really our country is fighting for America .
I started thinking , ` Are we helping them out so that they can help us out if we ever get into trouble ?
Does my brother believe in the cause ? '
I never ask him questions because it 's his job .
I 'm sure he 'd just say : ` You do n't have to worry about me .
I 'm more likely to get run over by a car or by a bus . '
Anyway , what would be the point of training to be a fighter and never going to war ?
That whole situation led me to think , ` What am I here for ?
Why am I living on this earth ?
Why are we all here ?
What can I do as an individual for the good of people , animals , the atmosphere ? '
The song 's saying that I ca n't answer these questions now - I 'm only 22 - and maybe we 'll never answer them . ''
