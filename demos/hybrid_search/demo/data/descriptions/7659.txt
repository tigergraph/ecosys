This buoyant , upbeat track is the second US single from Some Kind Of Trouble , the third studio album by British singer-songwriter James Blunt .
The song is one of several uncynical , bright and breezy tunes on the record .
`` It captures a bit of the mood of the early '80s .
There was a global atmosphere in the West that we could do anything -- the same optimism we felt as teenagers , '' said Blunt of the LP .
`` Some Kind Of Trouble really captures that same sense of freedom and excitement and naivety . ''
