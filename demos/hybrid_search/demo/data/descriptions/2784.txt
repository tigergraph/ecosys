This song , which was written by Herbie Mann and Carl Sigman , was originally recorded in 1962 by Mel Torm√© on his album Comin ' Home Baby !
and by Herbie Mann himself as a jazz instrumental the same year .
In 1983 Siouxsie and the Banshees spin-off band The Creatures did a Goth version taking it to # 14 in the UK charts .
The Pussycat Dolls also recorded it for their 2005 album PCD .
Leon Jackson explained to the Daily Record October 10 , 2008 why he did his own cover , which was based on The Creatures rendition : `` The record company and I had a discussion about what songs I liked .
This was one of them .
I 'm not really a fan of the band or a secret Goth but I loved the song .
I think you can hear me smiling in parts of the song which is a great achievement . ''
