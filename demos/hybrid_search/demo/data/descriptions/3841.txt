The Fork In the Road album was inspired by Young 's LincVolt electric car project , in which the singer and biodiesel pioneer Jonathan Goodwin retrofitted a 1959 Lincoln with an experimental electric engine .
Young told Rolling Stone : `` My life 's at a point where I 'd rather get rid of my material things and turn them into money to do the LincVolt . ''
The album was written whilst Young toured in the winter of 2008-09 .
It was recorded with the singer 's touring band -- Ben Keith -LRB- pedal steel guitar , keyboards -RRB- , Chad Cromwell -LRB- drums -RRB- , Rick Rosas -LRB- bass -RRB- , Pegi Young -LRB- vocals/wife -RRB- and Anthony Crawford -LRB- vocals , guitar -RRB- .
The song shifts tones multiple times , ranging from wryly self-aware -LRB- `` I 'm a big rock star , but my sales have tanked .
But I 've still got you , thanks , download this , sounds like s -- t '' -RRB- to heatedly political -LRB- `` There 's a bailout coming but its not for me , it 's for all those creeps watching tickers on TV '' -RRB- , to softly nostalgic -LRB- `` On the radio , those were the days , bring 'em back . '' -RRB-
