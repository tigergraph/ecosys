This song is on the album Where Myth Fades To Legend , making it a song that can date back to folk tales and myths .
It portrays a young couple living a wonderful life and one day , in the evening , they are torn apart when the man discovers that his lover is a witch .
She tries to explain , to which he replies : `` Please spare me your threats and your useless remarks , '' and later in the song after she 's finished explaining , he says , `` If you think you 'll win my forgiveness , sweetheart , you 're sadly mistaken . ''
Later in the song , he tells her that she 'd better run while she can , because , in their time , any suspicious acts of witchcraft by any person in their community shall be executed .
He was partially angry for her charades and mostly concerned for her because , in some twisted and chivalrous way , he still loved her as he did before this story unraveled .
