This song finds Cardle weighing on the topic of failed romance .
He told The Sun : `` I 've definitely had my fun .
Some of my mates were marrying and having kids .
I did n't even know if I liked the bird I was with , so we 'd split and I 'd move on .
I wondered if I 'd ever find someone .
That 's what ` Pull Me Under ' is about . ''
