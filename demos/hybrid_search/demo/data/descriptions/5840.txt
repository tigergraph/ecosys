DJ-producer Jamie Smith told Spin magazine how this Techno-influenced noir ballad was written .
`` I think it 's the only track on the album where we recorded just the bass and guitar and a demo of the vocals first , '' he said , before stating that he added a steel-drum part .
`` Then , '' he concluded , `` I spent a couple of nights on my own in a studio working on it , more as I would a remix rather than an xx song . ''
This was debuted by the xx on July 23 , 2012 at the Music Box in Los Angeles .
