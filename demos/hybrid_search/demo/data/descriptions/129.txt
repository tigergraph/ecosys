Somali-Canadian rapper / singer K'naan is the guest vocalist on this tune .
Frontman Pierre Bouvier told Buzznet they really wanted the Wavin ' Flag artist on this track as they thought , `` his voice suits the song perfectly . ''
The single version , which was released to the iTunes store on February 28 , 2012 , features guest vocals from Sean Paul rather than K'naan .
This song was inspired by Bouvier 's hobby of surfing , which is an important part of his life .
He told Buzznet : `` I 've spent a lot of time out there when the surf is not that great and you 're waiting for a wave , just sitting on the water seeing dolphins and seals go by , taking in a beautiful sunset .
I think about music a lot and have probably thought about some lyrics out there .
Also this song called `` Summer Paradise '' on the album has got that beautiful vibe that I can probably attribute to going on surf trips . ''
