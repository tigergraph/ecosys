This is the title track from the third studio album released by R&B / Pop singer Javier Colon and his first with Universal after winning the debut season of NBC 's reality show , The Voice .
Colon told AOL Music his wife `` was definitely moved , '' the first time he played her the song .
He added : `` It was a small biography of our lives .
She 's always been a supporter , she 's always been very strong for us .
At that particular time she was at a breaking point ... and rightfully so ... sometimes the business is n't that nice to you as an artist , people promise things to you and then you end up promising things to your family that end up not happening and you look bad .
So I 'm just glad to finally have a chance to put this music out there and have everyone hear it . ''
After being dropped by Capitol Records in 2006 , Colon and his wife had an argument about where his career was going .
The bills were piling up and little money was coming in .
As they tried to figure out their next move , Colon tried to reassure her and asked her to hang in as singing was the only thing he knew .
He explained to AOL Music : `` That 's what the song was about - that one day I would come through from you , and hopefully with this album is that day , that I 'm now going to be able to come through for her and my family . ''
