This is the 1993 hit that put their album Kerosene Hat on the charts and Cracker on the world stage of alternative music .
As can be glimpsed in the black-and-white video , the album Kerosene Hat was recorded at a sound stage built in an old barn in Pioneertown , California .
This is close to where lead singer David Lowery first met guitarist Johnny Hickman .
This song saw release in the UK as a compilation single , together with the tracks `` I Ride My Bike , '' `` Sunday Train , '' and `` Whole Lotta Trouble . ''
While Lowery was born in San Antonio , Texas , his childhood spent moving around with his father , who was stationed in the US Air Force , eventually landed him in Redlands , California , where he attended school .
He formed the band Camper Van Beethoven in Santa Cruz , where perhaps his most famous accomplishment was the song `` Take the Skinheads Bowling , '' used as the theme song to Michael Moore 's film Bowling for Columbine .
Lowery has also worked as a record producer .
Amongst the many bands he 's produced for are Sparklehorse , Counting Crows , Lauren Hoffman , September 67 , and Tea Leaf Green .
