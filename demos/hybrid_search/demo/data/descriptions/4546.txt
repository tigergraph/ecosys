This is the third single from Baptized In Filth , the fourth studio album by American Christian death metal band Impending Doom .
The long player was the band 's first to enter the top 100 of the Billboard album chart , peaking at # 98 .
Speaking with Noisecreep , Impending Doom lead singer Brook Reeves explained the concept behind the song 's music promo .
`` This video is a representation of the filthiness of sin that ultimately leads to hell and that is does n't matter if someone calls themselves a Christian with their mouth if they are not producing fruit in their lives , '' he said .
`` There are a lot of Christians out there who are fakes and will try and deceive you for power , money , or other lusts of the flesh especially in these last days .
So it 's up to genuine , real , and courageous Christians to stand up and speak truth and not compromise . ''
