This song is about the freedom of one-night-stands : `` Just the thought of those sweet ladies sends a shiver through my veins . ''
The subject matter and pop sound of the song was a huge departure from Supertramp 's previous work ; their previous three albums , Crime Of The Century , Crisis ?
What Crisis ?
and Even In The Quietest Moments , were pretty heavy .
With this track and others on the Breakfast In America album , they showed a lighter side of the band and found more commercial success .
Rick Davies sang lead on this track ; Hodgson sang backup and played guitar .
Davies and Hodgson did all the songwriting for Supertramp , but almost always wrote separately .
This one was written by Davies .
There is a good chance some of the lyrics refer to marijuana .
This is indicated by the lines , `` Goodbye Mary , Goodbye Jane , '' as marijuana is often called `` Mary Jane . ''
In this context , the singer is giving up pot .
This was used in the movie Magnolia .
It was also adapted for the TV show The Office when the character Michael Scott sang it to his nemesis as `` Goodbye Toby . ''
