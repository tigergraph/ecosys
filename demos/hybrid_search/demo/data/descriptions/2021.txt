This is an angry song directed to a lover .
The line , `` Turn up The Eagles ; the neighbors are listening '' was inspired by Walter Becker 's girlfriend , who loved the Eagles .
A year later , the Eagles returned the favor on `` Hotel California '' with the line , `` They stab it with their steely knives but they just ca n't kill the beast . ''
