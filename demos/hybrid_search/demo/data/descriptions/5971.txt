This snapshot of the difficulties of trying to keep track of all their ladies is the first single from British hip-hop trio N-Dubz 's sophomore album , Against All Odds .
Lead singer Dappy explained to Digital Spy that the trio 's late manager and his father `` wanted us to call the first album Against All Odds , but when he died we decided to call it Uncle B instead .
That 's why this time around we chose that name .
It 's not got anything to do with Phil Collins because we 're not into copying other people . ''
The song 's music video , which cost # 50,000 , was filmed on September 13 , 2009 .
It was helmed by American video director Dale `` Rage '' Resteghini who has worked with Souljah Boy and Busta Rhymes .
A Source told The Sun : `` They have really upped their game and splashed the cash .
One scene sees Dappy flying a personalised helicopter .
He had to fly it himself with an instructor by his side and he was very nervous . ''
