This is the title track from American Country artist Billy Currington 's fourth studio album .
He explained to The Boot that he named the record after the song as he had `` no other title . ''
Said Currington : `` I could n't think of anything else , and like I said , I had this rush job all of a sudden .
` Pretty Good At Drinkin ' Beer ' went really fast .
I expected 40 weeks and in eight weeks , I 'm having to turn out an album ... I do n't really like picking from song titles , but ` Enjoy Yourself ' is kind of the whole theme of what I want you to feel when you hear the album .
I want you to be happy and have fun .
Hopefully , this music makes you dance and laugh and sing along .
So , it was n't something that I ever felt like would be a single , but I definitely like the title for the album . ''
