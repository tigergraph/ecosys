Singer and chief songwriter Johnny Borrell explained to the London Times November 8 , 2008 why he wrote this song , which is full of religious imagery : `` I was learning a bit about Catholicism .
I was very interested in the concept that we 're ordinary sinners . ''
Borrell added : `` What it 's saying in that song is , my god is my lover and my lover is my god .
This bond that we have , that our love has created , is our religion . ''
