This song is about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome , also known as M.E. or Myalgic Encephalomyelitis , that laid The Streets ' Mike Skinner low for a year .
He told The Daily Record : `` It 's not just the embarrassment of having this thing that no one really believes exists .
I think people will find it hard to believe you could drive yourself into such a state by simply writing music .
I would , too , if it had n't happened to me . ''
The song documents Skinner 's struggle during the frustrating period .
He explained to The Sun : `` I was incapacitated , It seems to have faded now .
But at the time .
But at the time I think I was working too hard .
It was important to just mention it really .
It was such a big thing for me .
It lasted about a year at its worst .
I had to stop working.I spent quite a long time just watching James Bond films , which I 've got quite fond memories of in a way . ''
