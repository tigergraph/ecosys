On the surface , this song is about a girl and her dangerously addictive personality .
In addition to being a girl 's name , Amber is also the color of many beers , leading many listeners to determine that the song deals with James Hetfield 's past addition to alcohol , specifically beer .
But contrary to popular belief , this song 's lyrics do n't deal with Hetfield 's addictions - at least not intentionally .
According to the book This Monster Lives : The Inside Story of Some Kind of Monster , it was written in the spur of the moment after Metallica 's label forced them to record commercials for their sponsors , hinting that they had to do it if they were to remain on good terms with the label : `` Scratch your back so you wo n't stab mine . ''
