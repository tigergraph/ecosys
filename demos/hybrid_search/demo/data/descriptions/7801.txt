This woozy number finds West taking a sobering approach to his vices as he stumbles into an exes home for some emotionless sex .
West told guests during a playback of Yeezus that the song was added back to the tracklisting at the last minute because `` we really like that joint . ''
South Side Chicago rapper Chief Keef contributes some slurred rhymes whilst Justin Vernon of Bon Iver sings about sex and Hennessy on the mile-high hangover number .
Chief Keef first came to West 's attention when his `` I Do n't Like '' became a local hit in Chicago and Ye created a remix of the song with rappers Pusha T , Jadakiss and Big Sean .
As well as contributing to a trio of Yeezus tracks , Justin Vernon previously collaborated with West on three of his Dark Twisted Fantasy cuts , `` Dark Fantasy , '' `` Lost in The World '' and '' Monster . ''
He also has a writing credit on the Watching The Throne track `` That 's My Bitch . ''
