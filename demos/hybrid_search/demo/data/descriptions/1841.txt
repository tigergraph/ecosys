This Folk number is the title track of Bruce Springsteen 's 17th studio album .
The long player was produced by roots-rock vet Ron Aniello along with executive producer Jon Landau and The Boss himself .
Springsteen explained at an unveiling of the record in Paris , the title reflects the fact that , `` there has been a flat destruction of our values over the last 30 years leading to the inequality we have now .
Wrecking Ball is a metaphor for what has occurred . ''
Springsteen performed an early version of the song in 2009 at his final appearance at the Giants Stadium in East Rutherford , New Jersey , before it was torn down .
He wrote the tune partly in response to the closing of the stadium .
The song is also an ode to hard work , blue-collar dreams , victories won and lost and Springsteen 's home state .
He sings : `` I was raised out of steel here in the swamps of Jersey , some misty years ago , through the mud and the beer , and the blood and the cheers , I 've seen champions come and go . ''
Wrecking Ball became Springsteen 's 10th chart-topping album when it debuted at # 1 on the Billboard 200 .
This meant The Boss became only the fourth act to have scored 10 or more leaders on the list .
The other three being the Beatles -LRB- 19 -RRB- , Jay-Z -LRB- 12 -RRB- and Elvis Presley -LRB- 10 -RRB- .
Wrecking Ball 's ascent to the peak position also meant that Springsteen became the first male artist to tally a # 1 album in four straight decades .
The honor for the longest streak ever belongs to Barbra Streisand , who clocked a Billboard 200 chart-topper in five straight decades , starting with People in 1964 .
