Duffy in The Sun February 29 , 2008 : `` I wrote that with Jimmy Hogarth and Eg White around the time of ` Warwick Avenue . '
We put it down as a template and I went to stay in a hotel .
That night I remember feeling that the song was drowning .
I sometimes get these horrible , overwhelming feelings that things are n't going the right way .
I felt scared .
I knew I had to sing it the next day and be really clever with my phrasing .
A couple of days after that , I heard it back and was very grateful I had realized what to do .
The agony of that sleepless night was worth it .
It 's hard to turn a song around if you do n't approach it in the right way . ''
