The song 's narrator has reconciled with his girl after a break in their relationship .
He realizes that he needs her and vows that they are not going to spilt up again - this time he 's `` all in for life . ''
Lifehouse bass player Bryce Soderberg told About.com : '' ` All In ' was the last song that was written for the record .
Funny enough it wound up being the first song on the record .
It was the puzzle piece that was missing on this album to kick it off and kind of show people , ` Whoa , this is Lifehouse and they 're back . '
That song kind of hits you in the face . ''
