-LRB- thanks , Ivy - Birmingham , AL -RRB- Timbaland produced this and did the rap toward the end .
Aaliyah had previously worked with R. Kelly and Jermaine Dupri .
She did n't write songs , but prided herself on being able to interpret them .
This was nominated for a Grammy for Best Female R&B Vocal in 1999 .
The December 2008 issue of Vibe magazine includes an article about songwriter Stephen `` Static Major '' Garrett , who wrote this song .
It mentions that Aaliyah did not initially like this song and another Static wrote for her , `` Try Again . ''
She recorded them both , though , and they became big hits for her .
