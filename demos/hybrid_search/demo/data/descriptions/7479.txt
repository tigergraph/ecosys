Sadako Sasaki was a Japanese girl irradiated in Hiroshima in 1945 when she was 2 years old .
She died ten years later and is to this day a symbol of innocent victims of war .
Sadoka 's ambition was to fold 1,000 origami cranes to get a wish from the gods .
Viers has placed inside the Warp And Weft album some paper to be folded .
For every crane that is returned , she pledges to give a dollar to a peace group .
The Warp and Weft album title is a weaving term .
Veirs explained to American Songwriter magazine : `` It refers to the two directions of yarn on a loom .
I weave in old folk songs , references to other artists and lots of different and lyrical elements -LRB- dark and light -RRB- so for me the title works on multiple levels . ''
