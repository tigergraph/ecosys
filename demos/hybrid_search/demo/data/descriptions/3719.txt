This is the first single from American rapper Gucci Mane 's second album , The State vs. Radric Davis .
Polow Da Don provided the beat .
He told MTV News that the song came about because Gucci wanted to experiment : `` He did the hard part , '' Polow said .
`` He owns the streets right now .
All I did was what was easy for me - take what he 's built and capitalize off it .
We work hand-in-hand because I understand the pop side and I understand the street side and I 'm from Atlanta .
Usher , Gucci , Polow , it is what it is .
It was a natural vibe .
Me and Gucci did a bunch of records .
That 's like my boy , we talk every day .
So we went in and made some records .
-LSB- Gucci -RSB- was like , ' I wan na do something crazy , something the people wo n't expect . ' ''
The song about a show-stoppin ' girl in a club features the vocals of R&B artist Usher .
Usher also appears in the song 's music video , which was directed by Benny Boom .
Gucci 's leading lady is played by Bria Murphy , daughter of Hollywood superstar Eddie Murphy .
Polow told MTV News it was easy to get Usher onboard once he and Gucci laid the foundation .
Said Polow : `` One night me and Usher were hanging out , listening to records .
Gucci did some songs with Usher for his album anyway , so Usher was going to do something for his album .
He heard the record and wanted to do it .
It was on some kicking it and vibing .
It just happened . ''
