This tells the story of a guy in the '50s and '60s who frequented a restaurant where the patrons loved an obscure dance called the Crocodile Rock .
Because of all the events that happened in the '60s , however , this unknown little dance forever vanished into history and no one cared anymore .
Even his girlfriend , who also enjoyed `` burning up to the Crocodile Rock , '' left him .
It 's a catchy little song with really sad lyrics .
Elton 's lyricist Bernie Taupin told Esquire in 2011 that this song is `` a strange dichotomy because I do n't mind having created it , but it 's not something I would listen to . ''
The falsetto hook from Pat Boone 's 1962 hit , `` Speedy Gonzales '' has some similar `` La La `` s , and that song 's writers spoke out , accusing Elton of plagiarism .
There was no legal action taken , and Elton has copped to the influence , saying `` Crocodile Rock '' was `` a really blatant homage to ` Speedy Gonzales ' and all the great '50s and '60s records that we used to love . ''
Don McLean has mentioned that this is similar to his hit `` American Pie , '' which came out the previous year .
Both songs are about young people in the '50s obsessed with Rock And Roll , but disappointed when the music `` dies . ''
Both songs also feature a Chevy .
Elton admits the song is highly derivative because it 's about the things he grew up with .
In Elton John : The Definitive Biography , Elton is quoted as saying : `` I wanted it to be a record about all the things I grew up with .
Of course it 's a rip-off . ''
This album went to # 1 on both sides of the Atlantic .
It was Elton 's first # 1 in the UK , but Honky Chateau went to # 1 in the US earlier that year .

The sheer popularity of this song caused a backlash against it in some circles - notably disc jockeys who had to play it over and over .
Stations used to determine what songs they would play by using `` auditorium testing , '' where listeners were gathered into a big room and played hooks from different songs , which they would then rate .
This song always got very high marks , which embedded it onto playlists and drove some DJs to hate it .
The odd thing is that Elton has a very deep catalog filled not just with meaningful hits , but with more obscure songs that many listeners enjoy .
`` It was just a one-off thing , '' Elton said of `` Crocodile Rock , '' adding , `` It became a huge hit record , and in the long run , it became a negative for me . ''
One of Elton 's more memorable performances of this song took place on September 7 , 1973 at the Hollywood Bowl .
As Elton played from his piano , a few feet behind him , sound engineer Clive Franks played electric piano while wearing an enormous crocodile head .
There is a distinct '50s musical theme in this song .
Elton said that it contains flavors of a lot of his favorite early Rock songs , including `` Little Darlin ' , '' `` At The Hop '' and `` Oh Carol , '' as well as songs by The Beach Boys and Eddie Cochran .
The title is a play on the Bill Haley song `` See You Later Alligator '' - Haley 's `` Rock Around The Clock '' even gets a mention , as that 's what the other kids were listening to while our hero was doing the Crocodile Rock .
This was the first of many # 1 singles by Elton John in the US .
His first in the UK came in 1976 with Kiki Dee -LRB- `` Do n't Go Breaking My Heart '' -RRB- .
His first solo # 1 in the UK was `` Sacrifice '' in 1990 .
This song was inspired by the Australian band Daddy Cool and their hit single `` Eagle Rock , '' which Elton discovered on his 1972 tour to Australia .
In the artwork for the Do n't Shoot Me I 'm Only the Piano Player packaging , there is a shot of Bernie Taupin is wearing a badge that says `` Daddy Who ? ''
-LRB- thanks , Taal - Brisbane , Australia -RRB- Elton performed this on The Muppet Show when he appeared on a season 2 episode in 1977 .
A very popular song with kids , it made for a great opening number , with Elton performing in a swamp with a crocodile chorus .
A few `` firsts '' are attributed to both the song and album .
It was the first song released as a single on the MCA label -LRB- catalog # 40000 -RRB- after MCA dissolved its Uni -LRB- Elton John 's previous label -RRB- , Decca , Kapp and Coral labels .
It was also MCA 's first # 1 song as well as Elton John 's first # 1 .
-LRB- thanks , Denny - Pittsburgh , PA -RRB- Elton has described this song as `` disposable pop . ''
Bernie Taupin gave his thoughts in a 1989 interview with Music Connection .
Said Taupin : `` I do n't want people to remember me for ` Crocodile Rock ' .
I 'd much rather they remember me for songs like ` Candle In The Wind ' and 'Em pty Garden , ' songs that convey a message .
Well , they do n't really need to convey a message , as long as they can convey a feeling .
But there are things like ` Crocodile Rock , ' which was fun at the time , but it was pop fluff .
It was like , ` Okay , that was fun for now , throw it away , and here 's the next one .
So there 's a certain element of our music that is disposable , but I think you 'll find that in anybody 's catalog . ''
The Baha Men recorded a new version of this for the film The Crocodile Hunter : Collision Course with new lyrics that described the life of Steve Irwin .
Ironically , `` Suzie '' -LRB- the girl described in this song -RRB- is the name of Steve Irwin 's dog , who appears frequently on the series .
-LRB- thanks , Brett - Edmonton , Canada -RRB-
