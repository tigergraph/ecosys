magazine that this , `` was the first song written for The Infection back in June 2008 .
It set the mood for what was to come .
When Mark -LSB- Hunter , vocals -RSB- and I sat down to begin writing the album , the first notes plucked became the intro riff for this song , and we knew we were on to something . ''
