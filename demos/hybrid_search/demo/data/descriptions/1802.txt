This is an old fashioned drinking country song , a genre which is normally the preserve of male singers .
Sweeney told The Boot why she penned this boozy anthem .
`` I started playing bars in Austin and then all over Texas , then we moved to Louisiana and Oklahoma and New Mexico , then Arkansas and Alabama .
That was the kind of music I was raised on ... straight-up country and honky tonk music .
That song is the epitome of that .
A lot of people say that girls are n't supposed to drink or party , but I 'm like , what ?
It 's a girls ' anthem , but guys love it too .
Fans go crazy over that song .
Even when I say the song title , people freak out . ''
