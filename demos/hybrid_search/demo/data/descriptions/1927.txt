Paul Weller : `` This one started off with Simon -LRB- Dine , producer -RRB- .
He had an idea for a groove and we started building it from there .
At first it seems like it 's a straightforward R&B tune , and you expect it to follow the standard meter .
But I decided to experiment so there 's an atonal bit in the verse which was inspired by some Arabic poetry .
It 's got a real kick to it . ''
