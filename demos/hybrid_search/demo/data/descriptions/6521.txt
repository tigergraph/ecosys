This song is about 24 inch rims , cars , and drugs .
Some lyric interpretation : `` Money , hoes , cars , and clothes , that 's how all my niggas roll '' - Describing the life of T.I. 's friends .
`` Blowin ' dro on 24 's '' - smoking hydroponic , or homegrown , marijuana while in the car .
`` I been driving a drop-top Chevy with the roof wide open '' - He 's driving a convertible Chevy .
`` 454 SS , I race Porsches ! ''
- T.I. is probably driving a '70 or '71 convertible Chevy -LRB- probably a Monte Carlo -RRB- SS -LRB- Super Sport -RRB- with a 454 cubic inch V8 -LRB- a Corvette engine -RRB- .
