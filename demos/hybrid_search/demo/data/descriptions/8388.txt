Running to 2 minutes 47 seconds , this Roy Harper composition is the second track on his debut album Sophisticated Beggar .
From it we learn that he likes watching his goldfish and loves the baby sitting on his near , a logical hierarchy if nothing else , though he would have done better to ditch the inane words and record this as a half decent acoustic guitar instrumental .
