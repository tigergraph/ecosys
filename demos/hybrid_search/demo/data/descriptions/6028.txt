This is a track from their second album 2 , which was produced by Kevin Shirley .
Hughes explained to Musicradar.com how the band collaborated on this song : `` This is one that Joseph had started the day he came to the studio .
He had the acoustic bits , and I added my bass line .
The whole thing came together very quickly , but then , of course , what does n't happen fast with this band?If I had my druthers , Joe would be singing more in this group , but he wants me to sing and he wants to just play .
But I 'll say this , and I want everybody to hear me now : I. Love .
Joe .
Bonamassa 's .
Voice .
There you go .
I love his voice , and I wish he 'd sing more.Harmonizing with him , as we do on this track , was sheer bliss .
And thank you , Kevin , for having us put the 12-string in the pre-chorus and the chorus .
It 's very Zeppelin-y , but we 're not Zeppelin .
We 've just taken a little leaf from the page with the 12-string and the Bonzo and what have you -- that 's it , really .
We 're celebrating , if you will . ''
