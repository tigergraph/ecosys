Kyle Falconer -LRB- vocals/guitar -RRB- -LRB- from The View Are On Fire -RRB- : `` It 's about me and my mate Ryan Macphail going to a brothel that we never knew was a brothel and we got chased out .
That was a scary situation .
We were going about London , genuinely looking for Jacuzzis .
You know when you go to Jacuzzis in hotels and just chill out ?
That 's what we wanted .
And we could n't find one anywhere , so we ended up going to this place that said ` Jacuzzi Spa . '
-LRB- Laughs -RRB- We genuinely did n't have a clue !
I think we had # 20 between us and it was a tenner each to get in .
We 're thinking , ` It 's a bit steep , like .
But it 'll be alright . '
We were in the steam room and there was nothing there .
It was like , ` This is weird , man , We 've been here half an hour and there 's nae steam . '
They 're coming down and saying , 'D ` you want a beer ? '
and we were going , ` Yeah , I 'll have a Heineken , please ' and they 're just giving us cups of water .
Then we just clicked on and this big pimp boy comes in and goes , -LRB- bellowing cockney accent -RRB- ` F -- ing get out ... ' Then we had to get changed in front of all these hookers .
Scary .
I went and told my girlfriend and her whole family the story and she never spoke to me for about a week .
So it 's just like , ` Please give back the sun ' , as in the good times . ''
