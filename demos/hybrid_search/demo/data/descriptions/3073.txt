Noah Lennox , who records under the name of Panda Bear , is an experimental musician and a founding member of Animal Collective .
This is the title track and first single from his fourth solo album .
He explained its meaning in an interview with UK 's Sun newspaper : `` The song is about me wanting to appreciate what I 've got despite the fact that parts of my life work against each other and counterbalance each other.I 've thought a lot about why I make music and who I make music for and my relationship with music over the past couple of years .
I 've also thought a lot about my life as a father and as a member of a family and of a circle of friends .
The dots that connect all of these things are the subjects of the Tomboy songs . ''
Panda Bear explained the Tomboy album title to Spinner UK : `` A lot of the songs touch on the relationship of my life as a musician and my life as a person , '' he said .
`` The way those two things are constantly working with each other , or how I 'm constantly juggling those two things .
Lyrically , that was big.After I 'd written maybe four sets of lyrics for the songs , I had this image of a tomboy as representing that whole juxtaposition of forces . ''
