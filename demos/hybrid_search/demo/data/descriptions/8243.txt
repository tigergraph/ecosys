This song refers to the lack of originality and lyrical meaning in mainstream Hip-Hop music today .
Nas feels that while early Hip-Hop was about social change , today 's Hip-Hop is about materialism and degrading women 's status .
The song was produced by and features will.i.am .
The Black Eyed Pea explained to The Boombox in a 2012 interview that he and Nas were n't saying the genre of Hip-Hop was dead , rather they were , `` talking about it from a business standpoint . ''
He added : `` I do n't see a lot of artists raking it in from radio and sales off Hip-Hop . ''
This samples `` Apache '' by The Shadows and `` In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida '' by Iron Butterfly .
