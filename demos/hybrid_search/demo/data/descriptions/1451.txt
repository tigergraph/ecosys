This is the title track of American alternative rock band Lifehouse 's fifth studio album .
Lifehouse bass player Bryce Soderberg explained to About.com 's Bill Lamb why the record was named after this song : `` It was the first song written for the record .
It was kind of a Tom Petty influenced track .
Basically what happened with how it ties in with the title of the record is we were out touring off of Who we Are , our last record .
We wanted to kind of capture the essence and take a snapshot of what we were doing live in the studio for this record.So we kind of started doing these live , energetic , organic rock songs .
We did about five or six of these with ` Smoke and Mirrors ' being one of them , ` Nerve Damage ' being another .
About halfway through making the record we kind of realized we were missing an element that Lifehouse is thankful for that keeps the blood flowing , and that 's the radio side , millions of radio spins.So we started collaborating with Kevin Rudolf and Chris Daughtry and started experimenting with the pop record .
We started getting back to the record-making process .
Then we came up with songs like ` Halfway Gone ' and ` Had Enough . '
So we had the two sides to Lifehouse on this record , the live , organic rock side and then there 's the radio-friendly pop side .
The hybrid of the two kind of ambiguously fit in with the name Smoke and Mirrors . ''
