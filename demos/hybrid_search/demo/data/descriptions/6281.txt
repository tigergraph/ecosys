Buckcherry lead singer Josh Todd told Q magazine : `` I wrote that song in a studio while we were making the Time Bomb record which is our 2nd record and at the time I was single and I just wanted to write a song about like my Lover X , whoever that would be and that 's what the song 's really about it 's about this woman that did n't exist that I was trying to manifest in my life and I wound up doin ' that with my wife but at the time she was n't around . ''
