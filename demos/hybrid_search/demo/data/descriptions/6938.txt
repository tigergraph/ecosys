This song allies a euphoric sound to sad , resigned lyrics .
`` That song has a good duality , which I love in music frontman Bobby Gillespie told The Sun .
`` Country and soul are two of my favourite genres .
They can be ecstatic and painful at the same time .
Marvin Gaye was the king of that with ' I Heard It Through The Grapevine ' and even ` Sexual Healing . ' ''
