Vocalist Chad Gray discussed this track with Artist Direct : `` That song reminds me of old Mudvayne -- especially the verses .
Writing it , I hated that fu -- ing song .
I was like , `` What the f -- k are you doing ? ''
I do n't really start getting in tune with a track until I 'm sitting down getting ready to write lyrics .
I thought , ` How the f -- k am I going to write to this ? '
-LSB- Laughs -RSB- We get through it though .
We just keep working and working . ''
