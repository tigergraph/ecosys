Simpson -LRB- from Starpulse.com -RRB- : `` The song is saying that -LRB- It 's a bittersweet world -RRB- , and `` Why ca n't we all just get along ? ''
It 's a tongue-in-cheek kind of thing , but it really is one of those love-to-hate kind of things . ''
Simpson told MTV News why she named the album after this track .
`` I was contemplating Color Outside the Lines for a while , but Bittersweet World is kind of how I feel about the world right now . ''
