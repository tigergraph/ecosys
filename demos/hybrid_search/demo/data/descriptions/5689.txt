This moody track finds Karen O singing about a relationship turning sour .
Speaking in an interview with Pitchfork , the Yeah Yeah Yeahs vocalist revealed how the dark times members of the group were going through personally led the music to become an escape , as well as returning to their lo-fi roots .
`` Emotionally , it 's been a rollercoaster , '' she explained .
`` Being back in New York is intense for me .
I 've gone through an identity crisis .
It 's been very emotionally intense for Nick -LRB- Zinner , guitar -RRB- , too .
He was going through a breakup while we were making the album .
It was just all kind of down . ''
Mosquito finds the Yeah Yeah Yeahs returning to their lo-fi roots : `` There were dark times .
So whenever we 'd go into our studio space , we would just try and play music that was as uplifting and cheerful , '' Karen O told Pitchfork .
`` The music is more of a prescription for what we were feeling .
It was like a pep talk .
And it 's extremely lo-fi .
We had a shi -- y drum machine , a shi -- y sampled keyboard , tons of delay on the vocals .
There 's a real tone , character , and style to it .
And it 's probably some of the most tongue-in-cheek stuff that we 've done in a while . ''
