When Aerosmith started off , there were plenty of uncomplimentary comparisons with The Rolling Stones , inspired in part by Steven Tyler 's likeness to Mick Jagger .
Frustrated and partly in denial , Tyler took out his frustration in his songwriting .
This song 's lyric : `` Happy just to be in lust/Never have to eat no dust , '' he explained to Rolling Stone , `` is about what it was like to come out of the ashes . ''
He continued : `` It 's about using what I 've got , not thinking that I 'll never be as good as the Stones .
But if someone put me down about the Stones back then , I was a little afraid because I did n't want anyone to say I looked like Mick . ''
