Frontman Jamie Sutherland explained to The London Times January 2 , 2009 : `` Eilert Lovborg is a character in an Ibsen play called Hedda Gabler .
It 's probably the most pretentious song we have .
Some bands can write really well about getting wasted on a Saturday night .
But what can I say ?
We do n't appear to be one of them . ''
Sutherland expanded on the song to the NME June 13 , 2009 : `` It 's a song about unrequited love and relationships but it does n't sound like it 's being played by a four-piece guitar band in Sheffield so why not make the song a bit further out in your imagination . ''
Sutherland read Hedda Gabler at school .
He told Q magazine February 2009 that after seeing the band play live , Sutherland 's English teacher congratulated the singer , `` for obviously paying attention in class . ''
Sutherland explained to the NME that the Eilert Loevborg , `` is a genius academic who had the relationship with Hedda Gabler many years before the play takes place and he comes back on the scene but Hedda rejects him and he shoots himself with a pistol . ''
