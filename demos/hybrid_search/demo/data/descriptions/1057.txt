Rancid -LRB- From their MySpace site -RRB- : `` To control the outcome of any situation can often be a tumultuous task .
Lost in the insanity you might not only lose the important things that you cherish but also lose yourself in the process .
This song is an example of letting things go and letting them turn out as they may .
In the vain of The Lurkers .
This is the title track of our record .
Every record title for us seems to be the last thing we think of .
It 's hard to sum up a record with a title in the middle of the process although this is the greatest description of where we are at this particular moment in time .
Let life go where it takes you .
Take what comes no matter what it is .
There 's only a certain amount of stuff that you have control over so just let it go .
One of the first new songs that came out of the after dinner writing sessions at Skywalker . ''
