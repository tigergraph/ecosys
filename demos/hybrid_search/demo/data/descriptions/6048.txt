The Civil Wars duo of Joy Williams and John Paul White brought in their producer , Charlie Peacock , on this song .
Williams explained : `` He helped with arrangements and really helped take the song to a totally different place .
Sometimes as an artist , you ca n't see what needs rearranging when you 're so ` in it . '
Charlie brought perspective .
Almost like an eavesdrop within an ` Eavesdrop . ' ''
Williams gave birth to a son , Miles Alexander , in between the recording of The Civil Wars ' Barton Hollow and self-titled albums .
This song highlighted to her the change in her voice between the two records .
She explained : `` When I was first pregnant and performing on the road , I thought something was wrong with my voice .
I was having a hard time hitting high notes , while my low notes kept getting deeper and deeper .
I did some research with the help of a vocal coach , and learned that hormone levels affect a female singing range .
Having a boy , naturally , upped my testosterone levels , making low notes easier to hit and higher notes harder to reach . ''
`` But the great thing ?
, '' she added .
After having Miles , I regained my high range AND have kept my low range .
Pregnancy literally changed the makeup of my vocal cords .
There 's a different timbre to it now , and I love that I can hear the story of my son in my singing . ''
