Decemberists frontman Colin Meloy moved to a rural location north of Portland , Oregon in late 2009 with his wife and young son .
Meloy penned this song chronicling the changing of seasons just as the snow was meting during the first spring that he and his family spent in their new home .
`` It sounds so hokey , but it was just about sitting out there , '' Meloy told The Guardian nodding towards the view out over rich green woodland .
`` I think I was just really attached to this area , coming out of that winter and seeing how that environment changed every month , learning more about your surroundings , just kind of watching and witnessing what happens over the course of the seasons . ''
