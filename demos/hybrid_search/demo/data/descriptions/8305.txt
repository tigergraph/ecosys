This is the lead single from Vices and Virtues , the second studio album by Canadian rock band Art of Dying .
Produced by Howard Benson -LRB- Papa Roach , Three Doors Down -RRB- , the record was the band 's major label debut after signing under David Draiman and Dan Donegan 's Intoxication records .
Vices and Virtues was released on March 22 , 2011 , the same day as Panic At The Disco released the very similarly titled Vices & Virtues .
The song finds vocalist Jonny Hetherington singing , `` I wish I knew then what I know now / but I 'd probably do the same . ''
`` That line sums up a lot for me , '' the singer told Noisecreep .
`` There 's definitely a little smile behind it when I 'm singing it .
It 's kind of like - will I ever learn ?
Of course the answer is , not a chance -LSB- laughs -RSB- . ''
Hetherington explained the band 's name to Gibson.com : `` It 's the idea that the day you 're born is your first day on the planet , but it 's also your first day in your eventual path to your death .
It 's a dark way to think of it , but once you embrace the thought you 're not going to last forever , it makes your time here more important .
That 's how we live , and there 's seriousness to it in the sense that it 's really cool to try to accomplish something while you 're here , but there 's also an enjoyment side of things and making sure you do n't take yourself too seriously .
We 're a fun band that likes to have a lot of fun every day , too .
So it 's that combination of life . ''
