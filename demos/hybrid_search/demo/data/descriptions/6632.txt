One of the last songs recorded for the Saturday Night Wrist album , it came together when Deftones lead singer Chino Moreno sent the unfinished track to Serj Tankian of System of a Down .
`` The next day , he sent it back to me with vocals all over it , '' Moreno told Kerrang ! .
`` It was great !
It gave me a completely different perspective but it did sound a lot like System of a Down .
I focused on one part of it which gave it a foundation that everyone really liked . ''
