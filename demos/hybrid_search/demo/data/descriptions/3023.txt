Frontman Jonathan Pierce told NME that this song is `` kind of '' about the band 's guitarist Adam Kessler leaving The Drums two days before they were due to leave for their first American tour .
He explained : `` It 's sort of a goodbye song - but it 's not sentimental .
It 's not sad .
It 's more of an angry sort of thing .
We wrote it fresh off the heels of Adam telling us he was leaving .
I guess it 's more about feeling betrayed than feeling sad . ''
The `` Portamento '' album title refers to a vocal slide between two pitches .
Guitarist Jacob Graham told Digital Spy : `` The title actually means moving gradually from one point to another and the space between those two points .
I think that sums up the album - it ends up in a completely different place than our debut but there are elements of the first in there . ''
The song was conceived on the night of Kessler 's departure .
Pierce told UK radio station XFM that Kessler held some influence over Portamento : `` The first song we wrote for the new album was definitely a reaction to Adam leaving .
Sort of a bit of an angry song with a few emotions in there that we were feeling .
We were n't really sure how we were feeling so the song might come across as slightly confused . ''
