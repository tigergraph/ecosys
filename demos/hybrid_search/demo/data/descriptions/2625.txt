From the linear notes , lead singer Chino Moreno : `` This song was the very last thing recorded for the White Pony sessions .
I remember getting a call from B Real -LRB- from Cypress Hill -RRB- asking me if I had finished recording the lines he had asked me to speak for the song Rock Superstar .
I told him that I was finished , though I had n't actually gotten around to doing it .
He said , ` Cool , I 'm right around the corner from the studio .
I 'll swing by and pick it up . '
So I quickly ran into the vocal booth and asked Terry to hit ` record . '
I recorded around two minutes of me rambling on a DAT and literally ejected the tape as he walked in .
Anyway , that same day I asked him if he would be down to record some vocals for a song Crook and I had been working on titled Black Moon , and it would be sort of like a trade for the thing I had done for Rock Superstar .
I ended up feeling kind of bad because the original version of Black Moon was like five long verses .
So he sat wrote three full pages of lyrics compared to my couple sentences .
Some trade .
I just recently got a copy of what we did and edited it down fro this record .
Cypress has and always will be some of my favorite rap sh * t. I felt truly honored for the opportunity to work with B. I want to do it again . ''
