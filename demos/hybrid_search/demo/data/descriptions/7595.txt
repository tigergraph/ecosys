This slice of dancehall is a track from Black and White America , the ninth studio album by American singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz .
The song features Jay-Z and DJ Military and was inspired by a dance night at a restaurant Kravitz frequents in the Bahamas .
Kravitz explained the song 's meaning to MTV News : `` Well , ` boongie ' is a Bahamian word for ass .
But it 's not just an ass-shaking song .
There 's a place down the street from where I live , and on Sunday nights , people come down there and dance , '' he said .
`` It 's like a red light-bulb , pool-table shack and this DJ , Military .
And the thing I found beautiful was that you have these really full-figured Bahamian women showing up there , they know they 're beautiful , and they 're not buying into the lie , the stereotype of what media says is beautiful .
They exude this pride , and the song 's about that . ''
Jay-Z 's verse smoothly rides the song 's island rhythm .
`` When I wrote ` Boongie Drop ' I heard a rap in the middle , and I immediately heard Jay 's voice , '' Kravitz told Billboard magazine .
`` We had collaborated twice before , so I called him and when I went to New York I put him on the track . ''
The two previous instances that Kravitz worked with Jay-Z were on the track `` Storm , '' from his 2004 Baptism album and playing guitar on the song `` Guns & Roses '' from Jay-Z 's The Blueprint 2 : The Gift & The Curse set .
