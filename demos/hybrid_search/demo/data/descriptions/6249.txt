Paisley explained the background to this song in an interview with Billboard magazine : `` We venture into some touchy territory for me , which is dealing with childhood illness .
The song talks about one of my favorite places in the world -- St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital -- as well as Target House , which is the long-term stay facility that I 'm actively involved in at St. Jude .
Being able to say the words ` Target House ' in a song is a victory because I 've been there many times .
It 's saints at work . ''
Paisley gives a shout-out to a place close to his heart when he sings , `` that family moving back into Target House . ''
He told The Boot about Target House , which is part of St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital in Memphis .
`` Target House is where a family winds up if they are told their child is going to require more than six weeks worth of treatment , '' he explained .
`` Target House was built by Target as a place they can have the best situation a family could want , and that is they are together .
The art room and the gym were both donated by my friend -LSB- ice skating champion -RSB- Scott Hamilton , who introduced me to this place .
I donated the lodge , which is a hangout area in the center of the house where there 's a pool table and Guitar Hero , TVs and a fireplace .
It 's just a place to hang out and play games .
Amy Grant did the music room . ''
Paisley wrote this tear-jerker about a family dealing with their little boy 's cancer with Kelley Lovelace and Lee Thomas Miller .
