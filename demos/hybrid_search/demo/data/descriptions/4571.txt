Fort Minor is a side project for Mike Shinoda of Linkin ' Park .
This song is about his family , and their internment during World War II .
After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 , many Japanese Americans were forced into camps in retaliation and held there for the duration of the war .
The interviews that play in this song are Shinoda 's father and his aunt , who were both held in camps .
