This nod to former Guns N ' Roses and current Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash 's early days is the opening track from his self-titled solo album .
Most of songs on the record were tracked with former Nine Inch Nails drummer Josh Freese and ex-Jane 's Addiction bassist Chris Chaney and they feature a select list of vocalists that Slash wanted to work with .
Slash re-united with Guns N ' Roses rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin on this track .
He said : `` The only other person who played guitar on the record was Izzy , who came in and put some guitars on ` Ghost . '
It 's really cool because me and Izzy have a very recognisable dual guitar sound and I had n't heard it in a while .
It was just great fun .
I love Izzy . ''
This song features The Cult singer Ian Astbury on vocals .
Slash told Musicradar.com : `` It was actually pretty smooth sailing , and pretty easy to get it all together .
I was amazed .
Ian and I have a long history .
Guns N ' Roses ' first tour of Canada and the US was with The Cult .
Those guys had been around , and we were this crazy upstart band that they took out with them.I always thought Ian was great and when I finished the music to ` Ghost , ' he came to mind instantly , probably because of the chord changes .
But I had n't talked to him in a while and I felt sort of embarrassed to send it to him .
One of the things I had to get over making this record was getting the nerve up to go after these people .
But he 's an amazing singer .
To be in the studio and watch him work was definitely a very cool experience . ''
Ron English , a prominent Pop Surrealist artist and friend of Slash , produced the CD 's cover art from a painting .
