Christopher Tomson said of this track in the band 's track-by-track production notes : `` On this song , I experimented with certain rhythms that I avoided on the first record .
I like how this song alternates between heavy , Rock-like choruses and reggaeton verses . ''
Vocalist Ezra Koenig explained the influence of Bruce Springsteen on this song to the NME February 16 , 2010 .
He said : `` If you can hear some Springsteen on this song , that 's because I 'm a huge Springsteen fan .
My dad has all his records and also , growing up in New Jersey , you had to be aware of him .
He 's the master of writing songs about running away .
` Born To Run ' is a positive song , but this song deals with the fact that you could also be running away because you 're trying to ignore your problems . ''
Chris Baio told Drowned in Sound : `` This song really came together in the first week of rehearsals in Greenpoint in January .
The big breakthrough was the drum part CT wrote for the horn choruses - he 's definitely alluding to a tradition of rock drumming there .
It 's one of the biggest sounding parts we 've ever written .
When we were setting up drum mics in Avatar in New York in February I had the pleasure of ripping into that drum part .
Sometimes I wish I were a rock drummer ! ''
