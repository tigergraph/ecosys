Singer Fyfe Dangerfield in the Daily Mail February 29 , 2008 : `` This is the closest we get to R&B .
It was inspired by -LRB- bassist -RRB- Aristazabal 's on-off relationship with her boyfriend . ''
Digital Spy asked bassist Aristazabel Hawkes about the R&B influence on the album .
She replied : '' ` Big Dog ' is probably the most obvious one with an R&B influence .
We wrote that in the middle of the tour last year , when I was going through some weird on-and-off relationship stuff with my boyfriend .
When we recorded it , the song veered from being really stripped down to being totally rocking and packed with full-on guitars and industrial sounds .
I guess I 'm the biggest sucker for Hip-Hop and R&B in the group , so I definitely brought that influence to the song .
Thankfully , the others balanced it out so it does n't sound too cheesy .
It 's one of my favorites on the album . ''
