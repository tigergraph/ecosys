This is the opening track of American Metalcore quintet Atreyu 's fifth album , Congregation Of The Damned .
The song is based on a Joe Rogan comedy sketch in which he sees humans as a plague on the earth .
Vocalist Alex Varkatzas explained in publicity materials that he empathizes with Rogan 's plight .
He said : `` When you fly into LA it 's all green and beautiful but when you hit the city the air is putrid .
It 's a big black spot and it does n't fit into the natural geography .
Lyrically , it 's as if we 're this predatory organism talking over and killing everything .
Mother nature would be better off without humans walking the earth . ''
