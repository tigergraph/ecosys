The Who 's bass player John Entwistle wrote this at Pete Townshend 's request , as part of The Who 's rock opera Tommy , where the titular character experiences bullying .
Entwistle based the melody around the piano song `` Chopsticks , '' and based `` Cousin Kevin '' on an actual neighborhood bully he met as a child .
John Entwistle was the only member of The Who who could read music , having taken up the piano at the age seven of seven .
Before he reached his teens , Entwistle was also learning trumpet and French horn , and was playing in the Middlesex Youth Orchestra .
He composed this song using nearly every chord from A-F # , both majors and minors .
Like The Beatles ' `` I Am The Walrus , '' you will hear almost every chord in the musical scale being played here .
-LRB- thanks , Eli - Melrose Park , PA -RRB- This song was excluded from live performances for years because of the tough three-part harmony between Entwistle , Townshend , and Daltrey .
-LRB- thanks , Eli Rosen - Melrose Park , PA , for above 2 -RRB-
