Written by Allman Brothers guitarist Dickey Betts , this song is about celebrating life and having a good time .
It takes place at a bar , and when morning would come , the narrator would find his pony to take him home .
Tommy Talton sat in on acoustic guitarist for this song .
This is the last song on Brothers And Sisters .
Chuck Leavell played the piano on the album , and later worked with The Rolling Stones .
-LRB- thanks , Jim - Laramie , WY , for all above -RRB- Betts sang lead on this and played with a slide on a guitar called a dobro .
The song is structured in the style of Delta Blues .
At the end of the song , you can hear several members of the band playing the spoons on their knees .
The final song on the album `` Brothers and Sisters '' - Lyrics and Music by Richard Betts
