Bowersox and musician Brian Walker were married on October 10 , 2010 at Uncommon Ground Café in Chicago .
They met six years previously while both performing at the café 's Open Mic Night , but took their time to become a couple .
Bowersox explained to Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo Music : '' ` Speak Now ' was written in 2008 .
I was pregnant at the time .
Brian is not the biological father , but has been there from the beginning .
We had toyed around with being a couple back then , but he had fears of inadequacy and we were both broke musicians : ' I ca n't support you and a baby ! '
And I just kept telling him , like that line in -LSB- another Farmer 's Daughter song -RSB- ` Mine All Mine ' : ' I do n't want your money , honey , I just need your time . '
He was just scared , so I wrote ` Speak Now . '
Like , ` You better speak now , or I 'm leaving ! ' ''
