The opening song of Hail to the King , the sixth studio album by the American Heavy Metal band Avenged Sevenfold , was intentionally written as an intro track .
Guitarist Synyster Gates told MusicRadar.com : `` The idea was that the arrangement would evoke a sense of imagery with the tribal yet primordial drums .
It seemed to resonate from Hell almost .
It 's something of an apocalyptic call to arms . ''
`` I love the arrangement , '' he added .
`` We wanted to set up the album and foreshadow what was to come , being that it 's a groove-based , riff-oriented record .
We have n't really done Zeppelin-style or Sabbath-like riffs before , so this is our version of an album that 's along those lines . ''
Avenged Sevenfold continued their partnership with the Call of Duty video game franchise by lending this song to the game 's fourth and final downloadable content pack , Call of Duty : Black Ops II : Apocalypse .
It plays in the intro cinematic video for the Zombies map `` Origins . ''
The band previously contributed `` Not Ready to Die '' and `` Carry On '' to the Activision first-person shooter video game .
Lead vocalist M. Shadows told Kerrang !
magazine : `` If you just listen to the music , it feels like you 've been taken down to Hell .
From the riffs , to the bells ringing , to the horns , to the drumbeat , it feels like you 're being dragged down . ''
He added : `` It 's very like ` Sympathy For The Devil , ' in that there 's a silver-tongued Devil speaking to you .
He 's not all about fire and brimstone ; he 's luring you down and telling you he can make your life better than the guy up above .
There 's a temptation vibe to it , with pure chaos going on behind it . ''
The noise at the beginning of the song that sounds like rain is in fact fire .
