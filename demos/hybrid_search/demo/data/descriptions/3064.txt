This is the opening track from Pop recording artist Miley Cyrus ' third studio album , Ca n't Be Tamed .
Miley originally desired a new sound for the record , a more rock music inclined one , before settling on techno music inclined songs influenced by the Pop singers Lady Gaga and Britney Spears .
She told Billboard magazine : `` I listen to zero Pop music , which is really weird for someone who makes Pop music .
My 13-year-old self would have beaten up my 17-year-old self because she would be like , ` You 're a sellout ! '
But that 's not what it is .
It 's not dance music that 's just about , ` Ooh , I 'm in the club and everyone 's looking at me . '
It means something .
I 'm not just sitting here trying to sell glitz and glamour ... because no one lives that life .
A lot of Pop songs are super shallow , but this music is n't .
`` As an example , Miley cited this track , which is about someone who finds the courage to leave an abusive relationship .
For this song , Miley said she tried to combine a very serious topic with a lighter sound .
`` I wrote it for women that feel like they 're stuck in abusive relationships , but it 's a dance song , '' she said .
`` So you think that must be kind of a sad ballad , but it 's a party song .
It 's about breaking free . ''
Throughout her music career Miley has written songs with lyrics that empower young women .
She told MTV News that the tracks on Ca n't Be Tamed are no different .
`` I think ` Tamed ' does it the best , and ` Liberty Walk , ' '' she said .
`` It 's just about freeing yourself from anything you think is holding you back .
And I think that 's really important , especially for girls , because so many people are told , ` No , you ca n't do something , ' or , ` You need to be this because Mom and Dad say that , teachers say this . ' ''
Miley comes close to rapping on this song .
However , she told MTV news this MC is not a MC : `` I call it more of a spoken , rhythmic -LSB- singing style -RSB- , '' she explained .
`` I 'm not a rap type .
Maybe a little bit .
It 's speaking to the music , but if I say that I 'm a rapper , I 'm going to be like , ` I 'm not a rapper . '
I 've got no flow in that way .
I 've got no swag . ''
