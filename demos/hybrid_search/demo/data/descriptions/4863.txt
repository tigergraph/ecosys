The first single released from Jason Mraz 's fourth studio album finds the American singer-songwriter exalting the world we live in .
`` The world as I see it , is a remarkable place , '' he sings , `` A beautiful house in a forest , of stars in outer space . ''
Mraz penned the song whilst on a worldwide tour with his longtime friend and collaborator , percussionist Noel `` Toca '' Rivera .
Their trek involved not just playing concerts but immersing themselves in local culture and it appears their experiences inspired this song 's universal theme .
It was released on September 20 , 2011 on iTunes in the US .
Mraz from Billboard magazine : '' ` The World As I See It ' is a remarkable place and its how I choose to see the world .
I choose to see myself as part of the whole .
That I 'm no different than the smallest bird or the biggest mountain , that I 'm made up of the same materials as those . ''
This was chosen as the official theme for the `` In Search of Incredible '' global advertising campaign , which promoted the launch of the ASUS N Series notebook .
The song was inspired by Albert Einstein 's memoirs of the same title .
Mraz explained to Billboard magazine : `` He was a very compassionate man who loved this world unconditionally who opposed politics and policies and felt there was enough revealed through science that proved we are all connected and that we should all tread responsibly and respectfully while we 're here .
