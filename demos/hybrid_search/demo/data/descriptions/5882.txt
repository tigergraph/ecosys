This is one of a pair of songs - `` I Am a Wanderer '' being the other one - that Steve Earle wrote and produced for Joan Baez ' 2008 album Day After Tomorrow before recording them himself .
`` I asked her permission before I recorded them myself , '' Earle told Billboard Magazine .
`` They were just too good to leave lying around .
I think ` God is God ' is one of the best songs I 've ever written . ''
