Loeb wrote this with John Shanks and Shelly Peiken .
Shanks is a guitarist and producer who has worked with Michelle Branch , Kelly Clarkson , The Backstreet Boys and many others .
Peiken co-wrote Meredith Brooks ' hit `` Bitch , '' as well as several songs for Christina Aguilera , including `` What a Girl Wants . ''
Says Loeb : `` I was in a situation where my record company really wanted to hear the hits .
And instead of feeling the pressure to write the hits by myself , I decided to experiment writing with people who are known for writing hit songs .
I just like to write songs ; although it 's fun when they become hits , I do n't sit down to write hits .
I 'd had a couple of co-writing experiences where I wrote with people who had hit songs , and although I avoided it at first because I thought that seemed non-artistic , I realized that although those people were known for writing hits , they 're still musicians and songwriters , and they 're really fun to work with .
And it 's really great to see into how other people write music . ''
Says Loeb : `` The lyrics are more inspired by the music .
If you listen to the chorus that I did , that ' I did , I will , I can , ' you know , those repetitive short phrases .
It was interesting to learn how lyrics could mean something but also be in front of the music .
I think as a listener you mainly focus on the melody and the rhythm of songs more than lyrics sometimes .
At least I do .
Because I spend way too much time writing lyrics , I do n't pay as much attention to them when I 'm listening to music .
So it was interesting to key into how other people write lyrics based on feelings and based on rhythm and melody , but still make it sound like something .
I think those songs that are most fun to sing along to . ''
