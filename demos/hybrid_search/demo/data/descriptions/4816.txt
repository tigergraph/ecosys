The biggest surprise of Reckless and Relentless is this catchy song with absolutely no screaming .
Guitarist Ben Bruce described it to the Associated Press as , `` A straightforward slab of radio rock that 's free of breakdowns , screaming and synth breaks . ''
Speaking to Fallen Blue , Worsnop said the song was the first one , `` that I wrote the lyrics to using my emotions as a backdrop . ''
He also told Artist Direct that the track contains , `` stuff about my family and being a crap person to a lot of people . ''
Vocalist Danny Worsnop told Artist Direct about the song : `` I do n't listen to heavy music .
I do n't like screaming and all of that stuff .
I 'm into my rock 'n' roll .
I talked to the guys and I was like , ' I really want to put an all singing rock 'n' roll track on the album . '
That was as close as we could get to releasing a straight-up rock track . ''
