This song was written by Anthony Kiedis as a wedding proposal for bassist Flea and his new wife , model Frankie Rayder .
This song can show how much the band has changed over the years , and how diverse of a band they are .
A joke was made that the same man who yelled `` I want to party on your p -- sy , '' is now singing `` All I want is for you to be happy . ''
