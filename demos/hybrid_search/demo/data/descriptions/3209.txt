Isaac Hanson described the brassy '70s feel of this song to The Toronto Sun .
`` It just kind of sounded like a show band , '' he said .
`` Somewhere between James Brown and some rhythms from Michael Jackson 's ` Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough . '
It 's a really , really fun song to play .
It 's actually kind of exhausting .
There 's a lot of stuff in that song , you got to be on your toes .
There 's a lot of opportunities to screw up . ''
