This is a track from Genesis drummer and vocalist Phil Collins ' third solo album , No Jacket Required .
The song was made in response to everyone around Collins getting a divorce , including his manager , friends and though he was happily married to his second wife , Jill Taverman , himself years before .
He explained to The Mail on Sunday ; `` All my friends were breaking up with their partners - suddenly it seemed no one wanted to run the distance and work it out .
Contrary to what people may think , I tried very hard to work things out with the women who left me .
I never took it lying down ! ''
