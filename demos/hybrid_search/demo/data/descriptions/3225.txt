This song is about a boy growing up next-door to a family who has pretty much everything .
The kid has a crush on the husband 's wife and played ball with their son .
When the wife and the son got home from the mall one day they found out that the husband had committed suicide in the bathtub , hence the line , `` He was laying in an overflowing bathtub of red water . ''
