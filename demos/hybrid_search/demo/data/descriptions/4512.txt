Guitarist Anthony Armstrong explained the song to AntiMusic : `` It 's about leaving the past behind us .
Finally we see that we can close the door on our skeletons and make preparations for a future that is bound to hold new and exciting opportunities in every fascist of our lives .
We will no longer hold back the life that we have denied ourselves and see that the best is yet to come . ''
