This track features American singer-songwriter and rapper Kid Rock .
Slash recalled to Musicradar.com : `` Sometimes I would take two different ideas and send them to one artist to see which they gravitated towards .
With Kid Rock , I sent him the first one -- absolutely no reaction , no phone call back , nothing .
I thought , hmm .
So I sent him an email telling him I had another song that I thought he should hear because I had two songs that sounded like him .
So I sent him the other one ; instant reaction .
This is great . ''
