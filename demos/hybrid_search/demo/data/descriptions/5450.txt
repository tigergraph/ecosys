This club tune is the first single to be released by British/Irish girl group The Saturdays mini album , Headlines .
The set was released to bridge the gap between their second and third albums .
According to the quintet 's record label , `` The bittersweet lyrics are an ode to a lost love . ''
The song is about a troubled relationship .
Vanessa told BBC News : `` It 's about being in a relationship where the passion has gone - so you 're missing that spark .
It 's quite deep , actually , for a pop song . ''
The song 's music video was shot in Malaga , Spain at the end of May , 2010 .
Singer Vanessa White told BBC News : `` Every time we 'd turned round , our dresses would get stuck to our legs !
That was a nightmare .
It was either that or slipping over . ''
The girls also sung about troubled relationships on their previous singles `` Forever Is Over '' and `` Ego . ''
Vanessa explained to BBC why they so often choose to sing about such matters : `` I guess we always want to relate to what our fans are going through and everyone has been in a relationship like that.That 's why I really like doing Missing You acoustically .
When we use the full backing track , we have to do all the dance moves , but when it 's acoustic you can really get into the emotion of the song . ''
