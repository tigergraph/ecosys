PWT 's singer and main songwriter Tom Higgenson discussed this song with Alternative Press magazine : `` I am a very nostalgic guy , and I tend to romanticize my memories a lot .
Needless to say , past lovers are always popping in and out of my head .
I ca n't help but think about them and wonder where they are , who they 're dating and what they 're doing in life .
It 's a bittersweet feeling because it 's nice to remember these people , but it 's sad to think you may never see them again .
So for a while , I let them dance in my head and enjoy the memory . ''
