This was the first song to be promoted from Californian rockers Cake sixth studio album , Showroom of Compassion .
`` Sick Of You '' was Cake 's first new song in six years .
Showroom of Compassion debuted atop the Billboard 200 with sales of 44,000 , making it the lowest selling album to make it to # 1 in the history of the chart .
The album plummeted from the top position to # 25 in its second week on the Billboard 200 , the largest fall from the summit since Incubus ' Light Grenades plunged from # 1 to # 37 in its second week in December 2006 .
Cake only held onto the bittersweet record for a fortnight as two weeks after Showroom of Compassion reached # 1 , Amos Lee 's Mission Bell debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 with sales of just 40,000 .
Frontman John McCrea explained the song 's meaning to Spin magazine : `` It 's about how when you hate things , the circle of hate starts rather broadly .
You hate the President or a big movie star , someone you 'll probably never meet .
Gradually though , the circle tightens and the objects of hate get closer and closer to the hater .
Now it 's your uncle or your mother , now it 's your close friend , and finally it 's you .
Bummer . ''
