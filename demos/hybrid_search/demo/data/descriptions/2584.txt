This song refers to a John Kerry quote on ending the Vietnam War : `` We are asking Americans to think about that because how do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam ?
How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake ? ''
-LRB- thanks , Emily - Toronto , Canada -RRB- This anti-war track was covered by The Pet Shop Boys for their 2013 Electric album .
Neil Tennant of the band explained why they chose this song to Spin magazine : `` My favorite records by Bruce Springsteen are pop records : ` Dancing In The Dark , ' ` Tunnel Of Love , ' ` Streets Of Philadelphia . '
I think the cover we 've done of the Bruce Springsteen song on this album makes it into a pop song , '' he said .
`` But we have n't changed it any way at all .
It 's just done in a pop style rather than his E Street Band style .
We could do a lot of Bruce Springsteen - not that we will .
They 're very powerfully written songs with good melodies and quite simple chord changes , more simple than our chord changes , so they take to the electronic treatment . ''
