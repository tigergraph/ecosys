Drowning Pool wrote this song as a tribute to the members of the United States armed forces .
In 2005-2006 , the band toured in Iraq , Kuwait and South Korea , where they performed for the troops .
Upon returning to the United States , they wrote this anthem based on their experiences .
The Philadelphia Phillies relief pitcher Brad Lidge uses this as his entrance music .
His teammate Brett Myers introduced him to the song in spring training .
In an interview with ESPN , Lidge said : `` That song fired me up right away when I heard it .
The more I listened to it , and the more I found out about what Drowning Pool is doing for the soldiers , the more I wanted to come out to it .
Whatever side of the fence you 're on regarding the Iraq War , I think we can all agree that supporting our troops is essential . ''
Lidge is part of the `` Strikeouts For Troops '' organization where he donates money for every strikeout he records .
His brother-in-law served 2 tours with the marines in Iraq , and his best friend served in Kuwait as a member of the Air Force .
Drowning Pool uses this song to help raise money and awareness for troops to undergo mandatory mental-health screenings when returning from combat .
They helped set up the website thisisforthesoldiers.org to help the cause .
Says lead singer Ryan McCombs : `` It 's making that screening process mandatory so that we do n't let these guys and girls who are doing their jobs for the United States slip through the cracks again . ''
