Like the other tracks on Journal For Plague Lovers , this song originated from a folder containing lyrics , which the Welsh band 's former guitarist Edwards handed to bassist Nicky Wire , shortly before disappearing in early 1995 .
Vocalist James Dean Bradfield told the NME May 16 , 2009 : `` This song did feel like a dead flower to me , because it 's got the possibility of just giving up on conjugal relationships or love .
And that emotion is not turned to anybody in particular except himself .
It 's just saying , ` Perhaps I 'm not worthy of love , or love in relationships does n't work for me . ''
Bassist Nicky Wire commented to the NME : `` I just thought it was another one that seemed to come to a conclusion after a process . '
I endeavoured / To find a place where I became untethered. , ' it just feels like he 's looked at the possibilities and a lot of the conclusions are n't pretty or positive , but they are ... rational .
It 's just nice to know , I think , well , I know for a fact from the last 10 days that we were with him , that he 'd reached a place where he was much ... not happier . ''
