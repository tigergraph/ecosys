According to Thomas Hischak in his book The Tin Pan Alley Song Encyclopedia , the 1955 ditty `` Love And Marriage '' was `` probably the biggest Tin Pan Alley hit to come out of a television special '' .
With lyrics by Sammy Cahn and music by Jimmy Van Heusen , it was written for a musical version of the 1938 Thornton Wilder play Our Town , in which it was sung by Frank Sinatra .
It has since been recorded by Eddie Fisher , Frankie Vaughan and Peggy Lee , among others .
In 1987 , it was used as the theme song for the American TV series Married With Children , which ran for eleven seasons .
The song 's proposition that love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage does not sound so impressive in 21st Century America , when according to US Government figures nearly four babies in ten were born out of wedlock in 2005 .
And it sounds even less impressive when you realize that a horse is backed blindly onto a carriage and spends its working life pulling a heavy load only to be rewarded with a bag of oats a day and an occasional crack of a whip .
