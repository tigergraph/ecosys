Frontman Cormac Neeson told Kerrang !
February 21 , 2009 about this song : `` I 've been living in Belfast the last few years - and it 's how we view ourselves and Northern Ireland when we 're there and also how we view it when we 're the other side of the world in America and Australia or whatever , and trying to marry the two nations .
When you 're away from home you almost start to paint a prettier picture of where you 're from , whether it 's homesickness or just missing your local pub and friends .
When you get back there and you 're like , okay , this is the reality , this is the way it is , and that 's cool too . ''
