Yusuf told The Sun May 1 , 2009 that this song is , `` a story of prejudice and there 's a lot of that that around ! ''
He added : `` We have to deal with it and one way is symbolise the character , you know the outcast as a Roadsinger .
He 's a busker in a way .
He 's well traveled . ''
Mojo magazine June 2009 asked Yusuf if this is an autobiographical song .
He replied : `` It is but these days it 's with a small ` i. ' Would it have been with a capital ` R ' before ?
Yes .
But these days I can see myself drifting in and out without any problem .
I 'm just leaving a little trail , a little message about where this road singer 's been .
Somebody may pick up on that , may understand it , may want to know more , or may just move on .
The road singer 's there if you want to him .
He 's around . ''
Roadsinger was the former Cat Stevens ' follow-up to his 2006 set An Other Cup , which was the Muslim singer-songwriter first secular album in 28 years .
Yusuf told Billboard magazine : `` This one was really a result of me writing a lot of songs and being kind of inspired again .
After I recorded -LSB- ` Cup ' -RSB- people just wanted to hear me do a lot of simple stuff , just with the guitar . ''
