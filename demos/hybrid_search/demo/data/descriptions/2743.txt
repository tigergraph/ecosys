This is a track from American singer-songwriter Josh Groban 's fifth album , Illuminations .
It was released as a preview single on October 25 , 2010 .
Groban commented on this `` imperfect '' love song in an interview with Artist Direct : `` All the love songs are written in the grey area of love , where you experience great love and you are thinking cheesily , and all the sudden , the big love ballads make sense to you , after years of being cynical about them .
I was not in a love song mood ; I was in a mood for the imperfect moments .
For me , it 's not the happy ending , but about being undeniably magnetized in an imperfect situation . ''
