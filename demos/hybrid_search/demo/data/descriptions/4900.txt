Gallows vocalist Frank Carter explained this song to Kerrang !
April 18 , 2009 : `` I had this weird idea about politicians and liars , and how when they told conscious lies , their eyes would bleed black .
It would make the world a much safer place .
It amazes me that a man like Tony Blair could take our country to war , and not be afraid of the fact that every single person in the country knew where he lived . ''
