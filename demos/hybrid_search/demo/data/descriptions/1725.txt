This is about a man who keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit .
One day he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality , but he does n't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again .
Slipknot drummer Chris Fehn -LRB- # 3 -RRB- told us about this track : `` It was just a basic song .
We did n't know it was going to be that popular .
The funny thing is the record label , especially new guys at the record label , were coming around when we started getting big , and they 're like , ` Oh , the next record you can write like three Wait And Bleeds . '
And we 're just like , You are an idiot .
Therefore , we do n't do that .
But obviously the band , believe it or not , we have so much control over what we do that we do n't write anything for money , we do n't write anything for popularity , we have to like it first .
And it 's just a song that we liked , and it just so happened that it got on the radio and got the attention that we did n't expect . ''
