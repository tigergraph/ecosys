Sexsmith originally wrote this song for another artist before adapting it for himself .
He explained to CBC Music : `` I refashioned this song because I initially I wrote it about a year earlier , a different version , for Faith Hill .
They asked me , and I thought I do n't know anything about Faith Hill , but I thought I would write this song about family or something , family ties , and then they did n't want it .
I thought it 's a pretty good song , so I just worked on it and made it more personal . ''
In the summer of 2011 Sexsmith detected a lump in his throat .
A series of tests followed and waiting to hear the results put him in a reflective mood .
He told Spinner : `` It put me in a fog .
I was n't panicking , but I was thinking about my options and it was uncertain .
Was I going to be spending next year battling something ?
To be honest , I do n't think I even told Mitchell -LRB- Froom , producer -RRB- .
When I got the results , everything was fine .
`` Sexsmith wrote the last verse with his health issue on his mind , `` not knowing how much time we have and trying to appreciate the people in our lives . ''
