Gloriana 's Rachel Reinert wrote this song about the innocence of childhood .
She explained to Billboard magazine : `` From the ages of one to six , I lived in Marietta , Ga. , with my family .
Some of my fondest memories are of those times , like running through the sprinklers on summer days .
We had this huge magnolia tree in the back yard that I thought was the most beautiful thing on earth .
I wanted to reflect on that carefree childhood vibe and how circumstances change as we grow older .
My parents have since split up and everyone has moved on with their lives .
I wanted to express in a subtle way that even though things change , memories remain and will always be something that everyone cherishes . ''
