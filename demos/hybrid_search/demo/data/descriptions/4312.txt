It 's a lot of energy .
I want everybody to look forward to my third album .
It 's definitely gon na be worth the wait . ''
The album is named after Lloyd Banks ' debut album The Hunger For More .
He explained the album title to Billboard magazine : The ` Hunger for More ' idea came from a book that tells a story about robbing a bank , '' said the G-Unit rapper , `` and I 'm basically taking what 's mine .
That 's the statement I 'm trying to make - I 'm hungrier than before , and this time I 'm taking everything . ''
The song features Harlem rapper Juelz Santana on the second verse .
John Depp , who is a member of Santana 's rap group as well as Banks ' cousin brought together the two hip hop artists .
Banks explained to MTV News : `` The Juelz feature is something that did n't happen in -LSB- the past -RSB- because we had two of our own entities .
G-Unit had a lot of our own artists we had to showcase , same with Dipset .
I was doing records with Prodigy , Mobb Deep , with everybody .
I did n't have to go outside the circle .
I was excited about the staff we had there .
Now it 's time for change . ''
