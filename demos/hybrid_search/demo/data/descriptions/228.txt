In an interview on her MyYearbook.com page , Kate Heath asked vocalist Cristina Scabbia what inspired the theme behind Shallow Life .
She replied : `` We live in the fashion capital Milan , Italy .
We notice that everything in the media and press has to be absolutely perfect and shining .
There 's not a lot of place for normal people , normal jobs .
If you want to be a winner , you have to have a shiny car .
That basically inspired the whole album , even if it 's not a concept album . ''
