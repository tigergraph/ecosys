Toronto-based R&B singer Abel Tesfaye , a.k.a. the Weeknd , originally recorded this song for his second mixtape , Thursday , which was released in August 2011 .
Fourteen months later he created a visual for the track as a representation of how he feels and where he stands as an artist .
He explained in an open letter : `` Because I am a man of few words , I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand .
I usually do n't like to ` spoon feed ' my audience because I grew up idolising story tellers who tell stories using symbolism , so it was in my nature to do the same .
The ` Rolling Stone ' video takes place in a dimly lit studio , which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in .
The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground .
The girl holding on represents you . ''
