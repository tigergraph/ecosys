`` Saddle Up the Palomino '' is one of the first country-flavored songs by Neil Young , with a shared song credit with associates Tim Drummond and Bobby Charles .
It marks one of the turning points in Neil Young 's career ; he 'd finally gotten all the `` Ditch Trilogy '' baggage out of his system , split up with Carrie Snodgrass , and now had a son to think about .
A more mature Neil Young took to the studio with a new outlook on life.Note the lyrics here , with Young 's poetic bent applied to the Western broken-heart song .
`` It 's a cold bowl of chili when love lets you down . ''
See , you knew that all along , did n't you ?
Adding to the country sound of `` Saddle Up the Palomino '' are a pedal steel guitar played by Ben Keith , and a violin played by Carole Mayedo .
This song is also one of the earliest to feature the Saddlebags , the female backing vocal duo of Linda Ronstadt and Nicolette Larson .
Ronstadt has a career story all her own , but Larson had only gotten her big break with Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen -LRB- of `` Hot Rod Lincoln '' fame -RRB- , and had since bounced around as a session singer .
Larson would later become Neil Young 's next girlfriend , so if you notice an element of giggles and fun to this recording , you could just be hearing two people falling in love .
A palomino is a kind of horse - not a breed , but a color pattern with a golden champagne body and a white tail .
You 've most likely seen them in parades .
This horse variety also gives its name to several country & western tropes , including the Palomino Club in North Hollywood .
The Palomino Club was an early stage for such acts as The Flying Burrito Brothers and Dwight Yoakam , as well as being one of the birth places of the cowpunk genre .
