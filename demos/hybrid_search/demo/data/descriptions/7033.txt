This is the first song released from the Californian Rock band Deftones sixth studio album , Diamond Eyes .
The song was made available for free download through the band 's official website on February 23 , 2010 .
In November 2008 , Deftones bassist Chi Cheng was seriously injured in an automobile accident , leaving him in a coma .
Sergio Vega , the former bassist of post-hardcore band Quicksand , filled in for Cheng .
The album they 'd recorded in 2007-08 with their incapacitated colleague , Eros , was put on hold whilst the band waited to see if he recovered and the Vega-assisted Diamond Eyes was laid down in its place .
Unusually for the Deftones the tracks are upbeat and optimistic rather than their usual negative lyrical content .
Moreno told Billboard magazine that thematically the album reveals a `` positive zest for life . ''
He added .
`` There 's no complaining in this record and no hurting .
I 'm not singing about how I 'm sad or that my life sucks .
It 's all pretty positive . ''
Frontman Chino Moreno told Spin magazine this is one of his favorite tracks from Diamond Eyes .
He added it is a `` heavier '' tune with `` beautiful yet violent imagery , '' that has a fantasy vibe similar to `` Knife Party . ''
