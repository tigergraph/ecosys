This piano-driven soulful number was written for English singer-songwriter Joss Stone 's New West Vintage America Collection .
It was later released as a free download from jossstone.com and on iTunes .
The song was co-produced by Steve Greenwell , who was worked with Stone previously as an engineer and mixer .
He said of the track : `` I co-produced a new song along with Joss Stone .
It came out amazing .
She is so awesome !
There is so much swagger from Joss on this track , it almost shimmied off my console . ''
