Morissette told Billboard magazine that this song is `` essentially a song about my readiness to stop repeating bad patterns .
I 've kicked some of those in my life . ''
Many of the songs on this set were inspired by Morissette 's break-up of her engagement to actor Ryan Reynolds .
The album was produced and co-written by Guy Sigsworth -LRB- the former Frou Frou member who 's worked with Seal -LRB- `` Crazy '' -RRB- , Bj√∂rk -LRB- `` It 's Oh so Quiet '' -RRB- and Madonna -LRB- `` What It Feels Like For a Girl '' -RRB- -RRB- .
Morissette told Live Daily about working with Sigsworth : `` I remember hearing the Frou Frou song he did called `` Let Go . ''
I remember hearing that record and I thought , `` This is a flawless piece of production .
I would love to work with this person , whomever it is . ''
I did n't know who it was at first .
I tracked him down , called him and he was up for it and excited .
We kicked ass together , I think .
-LSB- Laughs -RSB- '' The album title comes from the lyric in this song .
`` I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement .
I declare a full time-out from all this commitment . ''
The Canadian singer-songwriter told Live Daily why she decided to name the album `` Flavors of Entanglement '' : `` It 's describing that which I need a break from , to say the least .
I 'm taking a little breather on the old jumping into commitment thing .
A lot of the songs , thematically , hover around that subject . ''
Morissette had been in relationships since her teenage years , but after breaking-up with Ryan Reynolds , she spent a year living the sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll lifestyle .
The singer-songwriter explained to the London Times June 14 , 2008 that this song is about her year of debauchery .
She said : `` It 's about the clarity , the exultation , finally bursting out of this self-imposed prison and just declaring that I would like to take a break because I was always the girl that would go from relationship to relationship and never have a breather .
So taking a year off from any kind of commitment has been amazing .
It 's been such a rite of passage .
Spending a year getting in trouble has been really , really fun . ''
