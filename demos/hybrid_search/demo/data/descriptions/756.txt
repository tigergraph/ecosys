After recording the title track of God 's Not Dead with lead singer Michael Tait 's former DC Talk bandmate Kevin Max , the Newsboys invited him back into the studio to sing on this cut .
The song was inspired by the band 's tie to I Am Second , a ministry that reaches out to struggling people and encourages them to live first for God .
