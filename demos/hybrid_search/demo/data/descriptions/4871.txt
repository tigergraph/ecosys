The Contemporary Christian singer Brandon Heath wrote this song about finding strength in God with his producer , Dan Muckala .
In our interview with Brandon Heath , he told us , `` I 'm really , really proud of this record -LRB- Leaving Eden -RRB- .
It was by far the hardest for me to make .
I think I wrote more for this one than I did for any other .
But I was battling a little bit with the label .
Not really battling - we did n't see eye to eye with some of the songs and there were some that did n't make the record and there were some that did .
But more than ever I 'm seeing the value of having A&R really challenge you as a writer and as an artist , because you 're building something bigger .
And sometimes as an artist it 's hard to see that big picture like a label often does , with singing and with branding .
During the process , creativity is so fickle and it 's so sensitive and when you 've got somebody poking and prodding at you , it 's irritating .
But stepping back from it , I 'm thankful now for the input from my A&R team at Provident , and I 'm very , very happy with the record .
This is my third record with Dan Muckala .
And I do n't trust anybody more than I do Dan . ''
The song 's music video was shot at Percy Priest Lake in Nashville , Tennessee .
In keeping the song 's theme , the clip 's storyline follows a young boy as he learns to pursue the light inside of him , even when it means standing alone .
