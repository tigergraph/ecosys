Rivers Cuomo , co-founder , lead singer and principal songwriter for Weezer , is one of the writers on this song , along with Lambert and Greg Wells -LRB- `` I Not Hook Up , '' by Kelly Clarkson -RRB- .
Cuomo told MTV News that this song draws from a fantastically eclectic combination of sounds .
`` It sounds like a combination of ABBA , with beautiful pop melodies , and a disco beat like you 'd hear in a Donna Summer song , '' he said .
`` But then there is this heavy guitar feel to it , like from -LSB- German techno-metal band -RSB- Rammstein or something .
It 's just a wonderful hybrid of all the music I love . ''
Cuomo told Rolling Stone that he originally penned this for his band .
He said : `` It 's one of my favorite songs I ever wrote .
For some reason , Weezer did n't want to record it for Raditude .
I figured it would end up on the next record and it just did n't fit this time around .
Then I was invited to sit in with Adam Lambert and watch him sing , and he was checking out the song .
And as it turns out , he came up with a few ideas for it for himself , changed the melody around , suggested some lyric changes and before you knew it , I was writing a song with Adam Lambert . ''
