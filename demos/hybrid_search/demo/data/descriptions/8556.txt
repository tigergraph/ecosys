This song is about a man who goes out to sea for two weeks at a time .
Beginning to feel more and more homesick by the day , he thinks he 's starting to hallucinate .
He then sees the most beautiful girl swimming in the sea , a mermaid .
He falls in love , and looks forward to is next trip to sea , so he can see her again .
One day when he ca n't take it anymore , he jumps into the sea to be with the girl .
