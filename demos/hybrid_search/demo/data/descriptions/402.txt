U2 wrote this for the movie Batman Forever .
They put it together from an outtake from the Zooropa sessions .
The song was both loved and hated : the was nominated for the Best Original Song Golden Globe award and also for a Razzie Award for Worst Original Song .
It lost both .
The video is a cartoon with a Batman theme .
This was the second U2 song written for a movie .
The first was `` Stay -LRB- Faraway So Close -RRB- '' for the 1993 Wim Wenders film of the same name .
U2 agreed to contribute to Batman Forever because they knew it would not be taken seriously .
They were sort of right - the song was nominated for both a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and a Razzie Award for Worst Original Song .
It lost both .
On the cover of Zooropa , purple letters spell out ISSMEKILLM .
It is a reference to this track , which was not finished yet .
This was the only song U2 recorded in 1995 .
They were on hiatus that year .
