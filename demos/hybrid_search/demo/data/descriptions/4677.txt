This countrified ballad was originally scheduled to be the first single from eighth season American Idol third-placed finalist Danny Gokey 's debut album , but it was withdrawn and replaced with `` My Best Days Are Ahead of Me . ''
The song debuted at Gokey 's hometown Milwaukee country radio station FM 106.1 on Friday November 6 , 2009 , where Gokey explained that the song details the trials of the jobless and the homeless .
Gokey told 106.1 about the message of the song , which he described as his favorite off the album : `` It has such a touching lyric .
It 's so beautiful .
I love all the songs that appear on my CD , but this one ... when I sing this song , a passion comes out of me .
The song went past the mental element and came directly into my heart .
I do n't know how to explain it .
I feel it when I sing it . ''
The song was produced by Mark Bright -LRB- Carrie Underwood -RRB- and written by Lady Antebellum 's Dave Haywood and Charles Kelley .
It was recorded by Gokey in Nashville .
