Monsters of Folk are an alternative rock band made up of Jim James of My Morning Jacket , Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis of Bright Eyes , and indie singer-songwriter Matt -LRB- M. -RRB- .
Ward .
Mogis explained to Express Night Out how this evolved from a M.Ward song that he was n't very happy with .
Said Mogis : `` The song actually did have a verse and a chorus and totally different vocal parts .
That was a song Matt brought to the table and he did n't really like it .
That was the one where everyone actually sang on all the verses .
They were actually Matt 's lyrics , but he never liked the song , I think .
That 's my personal opinion .
When it started out it sounded like another M. Ward song - it was worked on for `` Hold Time . ''
We tried the , how about you sing a verse , you sing a verse and maybe it will sound different .
We tried it and it sounded all right to me , but it did n't sound great .
So he was like , `` Why do n't we make it a segue and do this weird `` Goodway '' thing , one repetition of the chorus , then be done with it . ''
We worked on that for a minute then it ended up being three repetitions of the `` Goodway '' chorus , then two guitar solos , and then Conor wanted to do a spoken-word thing over it .
And in true Monsters of Folk fashion , we said , ` Oh , of course - that makes sense . ' ''
Mogis explained to Express Night Out the spoken word section : `` The spoken word thing ties into some of these themes of the record , but it was a letter that was found .
I do n't want to get into it because its supposed to remain anonymous .
It was n't anything that we actually wrote .
We thought it 's so funny because it ties into these yearning , searching type things , and then Conor read it .
And it 's all weird .
So that 's how we left it , like ` Oh , that 's uncomfortable . ' ''
