George Michael wrote this song in memory of his Brazilian partner , Anselmo Feleppa , whom he had met during a performance at the Rock in Rio II Festival in Rio de Janeiro in 1991 and who died tragically only two years after .
George said once that he had never felt real love until he met Anselmo .
That 's why he dedicated this song and the whole album Older to his lost boyfriend .
