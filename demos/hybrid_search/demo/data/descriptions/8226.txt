It was something Pete Townshend liked to do .
For the solo , Townshend ran his guitar through a device called an Envelope Follower .
It was a type of synthesizer distortion that made it sound like he was playing under water .
Pete Townshend wrote this .
It was part of his `` Lifehouse '' project , which was a film script featuring The Who in a future world where Rock 'n' Roll saves the masses .
