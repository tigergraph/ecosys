Rucker and producer Frank Rogers co-wrote this track with former American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi .
The song 's subject matter is about how choices made in the past can result in life 's path taking a completely different route .
Rucker told The Boot : `` I came home yesterday and -LSB- my wife -RSB- said , ` Do you know what my favorite song on the record is ? '
and I said , ` What ? '
and she said , ` This . '
I said , ` Me too . '
It 's a real good song . ''
Rucker told The Boot that the trio used modern technology to write this song : `` Frank and Kara started it and then we actually finished it on the iChat , '' he said .
The song was Rucker 's fifth chart-topper on the Country chart .
`` When we set out to record this album , we tried to choose songs that would mean something to the fans , '' said Rucker .
`` The single , ` This , ' was a song I never thought would be a single , but that just shows you the power of the fans because they were the ones requesting it , downloading it , and playing it for their friends .
It 's their support that has made my career in country music possible . ''
