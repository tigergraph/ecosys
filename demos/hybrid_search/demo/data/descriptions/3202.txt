This is the opening track to Heathen , which marked the return of producer Tony Visconti , who 'd co-produced many of Bowie 's classic albums in the 1970s .
Visconti recalled to Uncut magazine June 2008 about recording this track and the album : '' ` Sunday ' is absolutely stunning .
It took a long time to make and every time we added a layer of sound from either us or a visiting musician , the song grew to be more and more of an emotional experience .
I think Heathen was a very spiritual album .
David wrote some great lyrics , wore his heart on his sleeve for that album .
This is all my assumption .
He rarely `` explains '' his lyrics to me .
But I have to make something of them so I can help to create his musical settings .
Sometimes he would specifically tell me his meaning , to keep the recording focussed . ''
