This promotional single from American singer-songwriter Christina Perri 's debut album , lovestrong , was released to iTunes March 29 , 2011 .
The song draws inspiration from an experience in Perri 's life , when she found herself attending a dining event on her own .
She explained to AOL Music : '' ` The Lonely ' was funny .
Well , not really funny , but kind of sad .
It was the August of last year , and I remember I went to this event .
I was all dressed up with full hair and makeup and poufy dress .
Then I pulled into my driveway , alone , and sat in the car at 2AM and cried my eyes out and wrote that song .
It 's about loneliness but personified .
It 's about my relationship with nobody or with this ghost of somebody .
And it could n't have been more true for me during that time in my life . ''
Christina explained the song 's meaning to Teenvogue : '' ` The Lonely ' is about my love affair with loneliness .
The saddest , quietest , most painful kind .
It 's lonely personified .
It 's my relationship with no one , and I 'm very happy I kept it superdramatic and simple at the same time .
It 's me , a piano , plus a nineteen-piece orchestra . ''
