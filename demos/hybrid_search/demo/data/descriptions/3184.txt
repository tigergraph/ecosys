This song is about Hollywood , and how executives prey on young , easily exploitable talent .
This song is at a very slow tempo , and the 1st and 3rd beats of the bar are accentuated , rather than the 2nd and 4th which is the norm .
This strange rhythm is partly what gives the song its ` creepy ' feel , along with Thom Yorke 's crackling , bittersweet vocals .
Before Hail To The Thief was released , Radiohead put up posters around Los Angeles that said : `` Hungry?Sick?Begging for a break?Sweet?Fresh?Strung up by the wrists?We want young blood.Call 1-800-YOUNG-BLOOD '' The alternate title for this song is ` Your Time Is Up . '
