Jackson wrote and produced this song with Teddy Riley , who was one of the chief architects of the New Jack Swing movement in the late '80s and early '90s .
Aquil Davidson , a member of New Jack Swing Hip-Hop act Wreckx-N-Effect , wrote the rap lyrics .
The other members of Wreckx-N-Effect were Markell Riley , the brother of Teddy Riley and his half brother Brandon Mitchell .
Riley recalled to Musicradar.com : `` My biggest memory from that recording was that we used all car sounds as drum sounds and it came out perfectly .
I did n't go out into the field and record actual car sounds and take back to the studio -- I had a sample CD that was really cool .
It was n't something I 'd done before ; it was the first time I went for unusual sounds in the place of drums . ''
