Guitarist Anthony Armstrong told Artist Direct : `` We have all been in a place that feels like no matter what we do and how much we show we care for someone they still never understand exactly how far our love for them will go , ' I would die for you . '
`` He added : `` This song started off with a lot of heavily programmed beats and we liked the direction because it is a bit of a new vibe for us . ''
