This song was inspired by the Iraq War that many , including Audioslave , found unnecessary .
The lyrics deal with trying to live a normal life in a state of out-of-control global tension , aggression , violence , and insanity .
Lead singer Chris Cornell did not want Audioslave to be a political band like his former group Rage Against The Machine , but this song is an exception .
The breakdown of the song is recycled from another Audioslave song .
If you listen to `` Drown Me Slowly '' from the album Out Of Exile , during the bridge where Chris Cornell is singing , `` Do n't let them take you down . ''
If you listen closely you can hear him sing , `` The open mouth of the city swallowed the town with that same old concrete that I still walk down .
And it seems they put a shine on this place when I was young but baby I just do n't see it now . ''
