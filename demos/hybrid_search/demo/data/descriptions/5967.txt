Gloriana 's Rachel Reinert wrote this song with the band 's producer Matt Serletic , and Nashville songwriter Danny Myrick , who is a former member of Country music band Western Flyer .
Reinert told Billboard magazine : `` For this record , we really wanted to write about things that we know so the songs that I co-wrote all have significance to me .
They ended up being significant to Tom and Mike as well .
On this song , we wanted to capture the essence of being a young adult - where you 're still young , but you have your freedom .
It 's kind of an anthem for having fun on a Friday night with your friends . ''
