This was the one AM track that was n't recorded in California .
Alex Turner was asked by Q magazine if the LP will serve as the group 's `` big LA record . ''
He replied : `` It 's funny you should ask , because our label boss heard the song ` Fireside ' and told me it 's the most Californian song I 'd written . ''
`` And of course , that was the one I 'd written in London .
What I realize now is that , whatever we try , it always sounds like the Arctic Monkeys . ''
Q magazine told Alex Turner that the song sounds quite romantic .
Turner replied : '' ` Fireside ' is the same song as ` Do I Wan na Know ? '
in terms of what it 's saying , .
They 've both got a sort of ` Are You Lonesome Tonight ' quality .
It 's just how you tell 'em . ''
Former Coral member Bill Ryder-Jones contributed additional guitar to this tune .
Alex Turner said to Q magazine of the guitarist .
`` He got us out of a corner there with ` Fireside . '
I kept spoiling it with my sheddery and he came in with his guitar .
He 's a melancholy solo specialist ! ''
