This is the second major label single released by Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa .
The song acts as the follow-up to his breakthrough hit `` Black and Yellow , '' which was titled after his hometown football team 's black and canary color scheme .
Khalifa explained that the song 's inspiration was a resource he 's familiar with in an interview with MTV News .
`` Really , I just needed another single and we were trying to come up with a look and then me and -LSB- my manager -RSB- talked about it , '' he said .
`` We talked about it for three minutes .
And then I came up with that song . ''
The song was previously released in September 2010 as the lead single on Los Angeles producer and rapper Terrace Martin 's EP Here , My Dear with Khalifa as a featured artist .
Khalifa explained during an UStream session that there were a few reasons for the album title .
`` It 's called ` Rolling Papers , ' like the papers that you roll , the papers that I roll , the papers that we smoke .
But it 's deeper than that too .
I thought of this before I even started recording the album and before it was a full idea .
It 's not just about the weed thing .
It 's bigger than that .
My career really took off when I started smoking papers.The second reason I called it ` Rolling Papers ' is when I left Warner Bros. , I sort of got my ` rolling papers , '' he continued .
`` I got my contract , f -- ing rolled up and smoked .
And I was able to walk and I was able to leave and I was able to do my thing and I was able to capitalize off that .
The third reason why I named it ` Rolling Papers , ' I quit writing a long time ago .
I stopped physically writing it down or putting it in my BlackBerry or iPhone .
I write notes down , but I do n't write whole verses , so it was like saying goodbye to the paper .
The paper 's rolling out too . ''
A song called `` Roll Up '' from the album Rolling Papers must be about marijuana , right ?
According to Khalifa , that 's not the case ; it 's about being willing to `` roll up '' and see your girl whenever she needs you .
Khalifa told MTV News : `` I was trying to be funny , be clever as possible , '' said Wiz .
`` It 's for the chicks .
It 's for guys to sing to chicks .
And it 's just a fun song . ''
Khalifa 's summer-love anthem features production by the Norwegian team Stargate , who were also responsible for his breakout hit `` Black and Yellow . ''
The song 's music video finds Khalifa courting his love interest , who is played by R&B singer Cassie .
