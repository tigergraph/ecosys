This song expresses Summer 's sensuality and her ability to `` Feel Love . ''
Being subtly sexual , her managers were concerned that radio stations would n't play it due to Donna 's sexual moaning of `` I Feel Love . ''
-LRB- thanks , Andrew - Phoenix , AZ -RRB- Co-writer Pete Bellotte in Independent on Sunday magazine July 1 , 2007 : `` This was the last track on the concept album I Remember Yesterday , on which Donna sang the first track in a 1940s style , going through various other genr√©s until the final song was intended to represent the future .
We used a Moog synthesizer to give the song this futuristic feel , and discovered a new way to layer level upon level of sound on to the track in perfect sync .
We had no idea it was going to sound so special ... Donna was one of those phenomenal one-take artists - she could just come in , sing the song and go .
She was always spot on . ''
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England -RRB- When producer Brian Eno first listened to this song , he told David Bowie , `` I 've heard the sound of the future . ''
Like most of Summer 's early Disco hits , this was written and produced by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte .
The song with its entirely synthesized backing track was enormously influential in the development of disco , electronica and techno music .
However , Summer was initially unconvinced .
`` Giorgio brought me this popcorn track he had recorded , '' she later recalled , `` and I said , ` What the hell is this , Giorgio ' ? ''
Speaking to Mojo magazine September 2012 about this song , Giorgio Moroder recalled ; `` When we mixed it , by accident the engineer added a delay at the same tempo as the beat , which suddenly doubled the speed of the synth pulse .
That became the key sound of the record and the signature on my own songs like ` From Here to Eternity ' and on things like Sparks ' ` The Number One Song in Heaven . ' ''
