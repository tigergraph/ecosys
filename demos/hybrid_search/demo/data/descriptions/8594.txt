As I Lay Dying lead singer and lyricist Tim Lambesis told us about this song : '' ` The Darkest Nights ' sits fourth in the concept of the Shadows are Security album .
Many of the themes for that record come from a belief in something called the dark night of soul .
That is a moment in each person 's growth where their motivation for devotion changes from pure emotion and excitement to concrete belief shown by sacrifice and commitment even when we do n't feel that way .
The darkest night or lack of any emotional motivation comes sometime after an initially beautiful and life changing event .
That moment of hope is described in ` The Darkest Nights ' because it is those thoughts and memories that help us hold on . ''
