`` Experience '' is the fourth track on Gentle Giant 's fifth studio album In a Glass House .
It features Kerry Minnear on lead vocals and Derek Shulman on the `` master inner voices . ''
It is a song with a medieval feel to it , in the midst of a concept album about how people in glass houses should n't throw stones.In a Glass House was Gentle Giant 's first album without Phil Shulman , who had left the group due to the stress of touring and balancing his family life .
The In a Glass House album is legendary for not having a release in the United States because Columbia Records decided it was not commercial enough for the American audience .
So all sales of the album in the USA were imports , and Columbia missed out on hundreds of thousands of album sales .
In our interview with Derek and Ray Shulman of Gentle Giant , Derek says this about the song : `` I was thinking about having an experience , and looking back and realizing that we 'd done certain things in a different way , and now we 're older and we knew that the ways of what we were when we were youths were things that we learned from .
I think I was only 20-something when we were talking about being experienced .
So it 's funny , but I think some of the lyrics , writing with Phil and afterwards by myself , or with some help with the guys as well , were fairly good . ''
In the previous year , a made-for-TV film was aired called The Glass House , starring Alan Alda , Vic Morrow , and Billy Dee Williams , and based on a story by Truman Capote .
It 's a grim story about the horrific conditions inside a maximum security prison .
At least one reviewer at the time cited this as the influence for Gentle Giant 's In a Glass House album .
