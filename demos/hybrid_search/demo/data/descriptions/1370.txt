A theme of the album Volume 3 : The Subliminal Verses is Corey Taylor apologizing to his fans .
In Slipknot 's albums , the key focus is a girl .
In Volume 3 , he tells his fans that the girl he has been singing about and doing all these horrible things to , was n't real - he made her up !
In this song , he says , `` She is n't real ! ''
He never tells you directly that she was a lie , hence `` The subliminal verses . ''

2 '' is believed to be about an unrequited love interest from the first part of `` Vermilion . ''
Part 2 is much softer , and the video hints that the woman in the first video is now dead .
