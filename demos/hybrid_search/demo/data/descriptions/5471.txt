Vocalist Johnny Lloyd told NME about this hallucinogenic rattler : `` That 's the most experimental track on the record , '' he said .
`` It 's got no chorus and no verse , it 's a singular lyric that rolls through the whole thing with the most experimental s -- t. There 's even a sax solo .
At the end it sounds like something off -LRB- Lou Reed 's -RRB- Transformer .
It 's about being really strung out and being awake . ''
Wish To Scream only reached # 45 on the UK album chart .
Tribes announced in November 2013 that they were calling it a day following the muted reaction to the record .
