Eminem has form for dissing other stars on his tunes , and on this brutal Bangladesh produced track , he mocks Lady Gaga for past rumors that she is a hermaphrodite .
`` Tell Lady Gaga she can quit her job at the post office / She 's still a male lady , '' the hard-hitter Detroit MC raps , suggesting she 's not so much a `` lady '' at all .
The rapper also targets Justin Bieber on the cut , branding the young pop singer `` evil '' and a `` demon . ''
Some critics suggested Eminem had gone too far but the other half of Bad Meets Evil , Royce da 5 ' 9 '' , stuck up for his partner telling Billboard magazine : '' -LRB- Eminem -RRB- has a great sense of humor .
He 's been doing that type of thing his whole career .
It 's one of the things that makes him great .
I laughed when I heard it and told him he was crazy .
I definitely do n't think anyone should take it as an insult . ''
During an interview with Fuse TV , Eminem claimed his Lady Gaga diss was only a joke and he has nothing but respect for the New Yorker .
He explained : `` I think Lady GaGa , as an artist you know , she 's undeniable .
That was one of them things where sometimes I get a joke in my head and I kinda want to share it with the world , you know what I 'm saying .
So it was just one of them things man , and it 's , you know , it 's all in fun , it 's Hip-Hop . ''
