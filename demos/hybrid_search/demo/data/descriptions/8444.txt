Everything Changes is English singer-songwriter Julian Lennon 's sixth studio album and his first since 1998 's Photograph Smile .
In between his two releases Lennon concentrated on business pursuits and filmmaking , but eventually he writing songs again .
He explained : `` Obviously , if you sit down and play around for a bit , you 're going to come up with ideas .
One thing led to another and pretty soon I had about 30 ideas , so I invited some friends to come over and flesh them out into songs . ''
Everything Changes is very much a homemade record .
Lennon told Billboard magazine : `` It was done mostly at home , in my own time and just by working closely with friends .
Whenever they 'd pop by for a cup of tea , I 'd go , ` Fancy putting a bassline on this or doing some cello or backgrounds ? '
It was a pleasant process for me . ''
In our Julian Lennon interview , he explained the meaning behind this song : `` Along with everybody else , I have been down those dark tunnels where you just do n't think things are going to change or get better .
But inevitably they do , for the most part .
Sadly , not for everybody .
But to lose sight and to lose hope of that would be a terrible thing , so one must keep motivating towards the positive views in life . ''
