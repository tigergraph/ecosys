This tribute to the Marine Corps appears on the Deluxe edition of Proud To Be Here , the tenth studio album by American Country music artist Trace Adkins .
He told The Boot : `` A lot of times we go into these combat zones and do the USO trips and there are n't any Marines at the shows .
We do n't get to go where the Marines are because the Marines are stationed in really hot -LSB- dangerous -RSB- areas .
They wo n't let us go there and they do n't get to come to the shows either because they are out in the middle of nowhere .
So we decided we would do a song for the Marine Corps and give it to them .
That 's really why we did it . ''
`` Semper Fidelis , '' which is Latin for `` Always Faithful , '' is the motto of the US Marine Corps .
