This track was penned by Escovedo for a much loved departed buddy .
He explained to Express Night Out : `` That 's a song I wrote for my dear friend Stephen Bruton who produced my first three albums .
He played guitar with Kris Kristofferson for 15 years , played with Bonnie Raitt , wrote songs that the Highwaymen did and played with Bob Dylan for a little while .
And he wrote the soundtrack to Crazy Heart too .
He died of cancer last year .
I loved him very much and I miss him very much and , really , kind of like everything I know I learned from him .
So I wanted to write something for him . ''
