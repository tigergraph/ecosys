This Reggae song is a personal lament for Rastas lack of privacy in the ghettos of Jamaica .
Inner Circle attached the moniker `` killer '' to its new lead singer , Jacob Miller , and in 1976 the musical rampage began .
This was the first song he recorded with the group .
Miller died in 1981 in a car crash on Hope Road in Kingston .
With Jacob 's death Inner Circle was thrown into a stage of chaotic readjustment .
