Another track on the album , `` The Cure '' is about the same topic .

`` We 'd talked about projecting an image of yourself that was n't necessarily accurate , or embellishing parts of yourself in order to attract somebody who is maybe looking for something different than your true self , '' Sara explained to Rolling Stone.Sara ended up wearing the monster suit as Tegan was physically unable to pull it off .
`` I was supposed to wear it but we changed it because I 'm actually quite claustrophobic , and when they brought the costume in I was like , no ! ''
Tegan admitted to Rolling Stone .
