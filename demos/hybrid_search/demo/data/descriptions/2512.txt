This brooding song features the lyric , `` I believe in God . ''
Speaking with The Sun , Cave put his apparent statement of faith into context into context .
`` I 'm talking about believing in God , believing in mermaids and believing in 72 virgins , '' he said .
`` The song starts reeling off the options and I think what I 'm really saying is I believe in the idea of believing in things.The fact that we humans have that capacity or need to believe is not a shameful thing as some people might see it , but hugely endearing . ''
Cave also references an incident in December 2010 when he crashed his Jaguar car into a speed camera .
`` I do driver alertness course , '' he intones in his baritone croon .
The singer and his twin sons all walked away from the accident unharmed , but Cave had to attend a driver alertness course as a punishment .
`` I rather liked it , '' he told The Sun .
`` Because it was really rehab for drivers and there was that kind of shameful look about the people there . ''
