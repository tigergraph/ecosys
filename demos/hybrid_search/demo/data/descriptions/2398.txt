Men 's Fitness magazine asked Rihanna if she really was a `` good girl gone bad . ''
She replied : `` The title of the album represents my liberation .
Being able to break out of the innocent image I was forced into .
Now I 'm just being me .
I 'm a little more rebellious .
On the record you hear that I have a lot more attitude .
So it matches the new sound , the new image , the new haircut ... the new everything . ''
