Back in the early 2000s Blue were the British boy band , racking up three # 1 hits and nine other singles that reached the Top 20 .
The band split in 2005 before reuniting four years later .
In 2011 it was announced that they would represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 , with their comeback single `` I Can , '' which coincided with the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the band in 2001 .
The song finished in 11th place on the Eurovision Song Contest with a final result of 100 points .
Blue wrote the song with Dsign Music , a Norwegian songwriting/production company formed in 2006 by Robin Jenssen , Anne Judith Wik , Nermin Harambašić and Ronny Svendsen .
Duncan from the band told Digital Spy the song was not written specifically for the contest and was penned before they were asked to represent the UK .
`` This would have been our comeback single regardless , we did n't write it especially for the competition .
It just so happens that the message in the song fits with the theme of it , '' he said .
