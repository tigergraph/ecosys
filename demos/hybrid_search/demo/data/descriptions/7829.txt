This was written by songwriter Johnta Austin .
Among the other songs Austin has written are the hits `` Do n't Forget About Us , '' `` It 's Like That , '' `` Shake It Off '' and `` We Belong Together '' for Mariah Carey and Mary J Blige 's single `` Be Without You . ''
He won Grammy Awards for the latter two songs .
A remixed version featuring Plies was included on the soundtrack to the 2008 movie Step Up 2 The Streets .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- Trey Songz was asked by allhiphop.com about the current trend for songwriters becoming performers .
`` It 's funny because with Rap if you did n't write your own rhymes you did n't get respect .
But with singing , it really never mattered because I guess people viewed it differently .
With me , I 've always looked at it that way .
I love to write my own songs and tell my story because I feel like nobody can tell it better than me .
It 's funny because the biggest record that I 've ever had , which is ` Ca n't Help but Wait ' was n't written by me .
That 's because a lot of things in the game have changed .
A radio record is a certain kind of record ; to be able to pop it has to be in a certain format .
So as far as songwriters becoming artists , if you 're a good artist , I do n't have a problem with that .
Certain songs are for certain people and certain -LSB- songwriters -RSB- know how to fit a song with the artist - if you have the ability to pull that off .
Certain songwriters should n't be artists ; some artists should n't be songwriters . ''
This was Trey Songz ' first US Top 40 solo hit .
His previous highest charting single had been `` Gotts Go , '' which peaked at # 67 in 2006 .
