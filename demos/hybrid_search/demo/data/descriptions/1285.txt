Bishop Swithin of Winchester , the counsellor of the Wessex kings Egbert and Aethelwulf died in 862 .
He was buried , according to his wishes , in a common grave outside his Winchester church .
When a new cathedral was built at Winchester , it was planned that he would be reburied within the cathedral on 15th July 971 .
However the reburial was delayed by prolonged heavy rain and it was thought that Saint Swithin himself bought this retribution because he always hated pomp .
Hence the belief that if it rains on 15th July , Saint Swithin 's Day , it will continue to rain for 40 days.In time St. Swithin 's Day came to be British slang for the day that never comes .
English Singer-songwriter Billy Bragg released this tune titled after the saint 's feast day on his second album Brewing Up With Billy Bragg .
His song is a sad one as it appears the narrator and his lover never properly communicated their feelings to each other , so unfortunately it resulted in a love that never comes .
British author David Nicholls ' best selling romantic novel One Day , which was made into a feature film in 2011 , tells the story of two people who meet every St Swithin 's Day over a period of twenty years .
Nicholls acknowledges that the concluding lines of this song inspired the story : `` The Polaroids that hold us together/Will surely fade away/Like the love that we spoke of forever/On St Swithin 's Day . ''
