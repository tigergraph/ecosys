If people read , they would love that man .
That man is a mind-game genius .
I read the Machiavelli war-tactic books , his biography , everything .
That man is just like sticks and stones , bad .
You see Waka Flocka , what do you think ?
Negativity .
You read Machiavelli ?
Negativity .
My brain , I 'm so sharp , I can play stupid on the camera and they think I 'm dumb .
So really , you just playing yourself .
I 'm so ahead of y' all .
That 's for the bloggers . ''
Wow . ''
Drumma Boy produced the song , which features Roscoe Dash on the chorus and a verse from Wale .
Niccolò Machiavelli was the first political thinker of modern times to justify immoral actions by the needs of state policy .
He outlined his arguments in the highly influential book The Prince , which was based on the premise that when ruling the means justify the ends .
The word `` Machiavellian '' has come to mean `` unscrupulous '' when applied to politics .
