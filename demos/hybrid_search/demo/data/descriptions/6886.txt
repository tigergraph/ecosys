Swedish House Mafia member Steve Angello also contributed to the track .
MTV UK asked Cruz whether after the international success of `` Break Your Heart '' and `` Dynamite , '' he felt under pressure with the release of this single ?
He replied : `` I would n't say that I feel more pressure with this single , what I always try to do is to make music that I enjoy , that is fun and excites me -- that 's all you can do and then put it out there .
If you let anyone pull you in any direction , you can lose yourself , so I try not to let the pressure get to me .
I 'll go in the studio and make fun songs , play them to my team and then play them to my fans . ''
