Cook co-wrote this tune with British songwriter-producers James Irvin and Julian Emery , whose other credits include Michelle Branch 's single , `` Loud Music . ''
He explained to Billboard magazine how his opinion of the song changed over time : `` I hated this song after I wrote it .
We finished the song and I just was n't crazy about it ... But everybody else was so into that song and I just could n't figure it out .
So we chased it down and it ended up being one of my favorite songs on this record . ''
