This was released as the third single from British singer-songwriter Passenger 's All the Little Lights album .
He told VH1 : `` It 's a really hopeful song , I think .
Some of the album is pretty sad , pretty dark , and I think ` Holes ' is a really nice song to put at the end of a concert to bring the mood up . ''
After the breakup of his band Passenger in 2009 , Mike Rosenberg kept the group 's name for himself and took to busking for a solo music career .
This song 's music video is a film of a busking session in his home town of Brighton , England .
