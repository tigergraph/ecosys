Scotty sings about a girl making a country boy look good on this Rhett Akins and Lee Thomas Miller penned rocker .
He said : `` It talks about how I might have a dirty truck , but when you are sitting there beside me , you make it look good .
At the end it says , I never thought of getting settled down and having a serious relationship , but you make that look good .
It talks about some things in life that had never looked too good to this dude , but now that he is with her , she makes them look good and makes him want to do them . ''
Both a father and son contributed to Clear As Day .
Whilst Rhett Akins co-penned this song , his son , Thomas , co-wrote `` Write My Number on Your Hand . ''
