This is the second single from the Canadian Punk Rock band Sum 41 's fifth studio album , Screaming Bloody Murder .
It was officially released on April 26 , 2011 .
Despite the three and a half year gap since Sum 41 's previous release , Underclass Hero , the song writing came easily to frontman Deryck Whibley .
He told Artist Direct : `` I do n't know where these songs came from .
I do n't even remember writing them .
I heard them and do n't remember where they came from or writing them .
The whole record felt like a gift and I do n't feel like I had anything to do with it , but I did , since I wrote everything .
Every song I wrote came within 10 minutes and it took 10-15 minutes to get it out .
I did n't spend more time on them , but the album took a long time , three years .
I never sat down and said , ' I am going to write a song . '
I 'd be in the middle of a conversation and be like ` F -- k , ` Incoming !
I have an idea . '
I would throw down the idea , go back to the conversation and then go through my tapes . ''
