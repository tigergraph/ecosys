This song takes its name from a jewelery shop in London 's Soho , however the lyrics make no mention of the retail store .
Bass player Rhys Webb told NME : `` It was written with the quirkiness of some great English '60s pop in mind .
We always like tracks with people 's name in the title too . ''
Guitarist Joshua Haywood not only built The Horrors ' s studio in which most of Skying was recorded , but also everything inside it including a big synthesizer that 's controlled by a guitar .
Synth player Tom Cowan told NME : `` Josh 's guitar modular synth is used to great effect all over this one , screaming and whining like a Jaguar possessed . ''
