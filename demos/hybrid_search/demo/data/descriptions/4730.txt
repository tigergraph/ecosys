This song features CJ , a young musician from Baltimore that Saadiq has been working with , and some harmonica from Stevie Wonder , who needs no introduction .
Saadiq talked about his collaboration with the Motown superstar on his website : `` When we first did the track , I had this spot where we said , ` Please invite Mr. Stevie Wonder to my album ' the way Stevie did with Dizzy Gillespie on one of his records .
Originally , Stevie was n't on it but I felt like he should be there .
I ended up calling him and he came over to the studio in an hour !
I still ca n't get used to Stevie Wonder being my friend . ''
