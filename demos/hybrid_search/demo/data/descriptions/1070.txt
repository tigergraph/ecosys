This is the third single released from The Powerless Rise , the fifth studio album by American metalcore band As I Lay Dying .
Vocalist Tim Lambesis explained in a band update that the message of the song is , `` to stand up for what you believe in . ''
Boston-based directors Ian McFarland and Mike Pecci shot the music video , which focuses on a story that follows the song 's meaning .
It stars the band members as the main characters and was filmed POV style from the perspective of the drummer , Jordan Mancino .
Lambesis told Noisecreep that the clip captured the exact spirit of aggression , defiance and oppression they were hoping for .
`` The album has a lot to do with standing up for the powerless and defending those oppressed by injustice , '' said the frontman .
`` As a result of knowing people in these circumstances , I find it nearly impossible to not do what I can to help themHowever , standing up for any belief not popularly held by society comes with repercussions .
In wealthy ` free ' society , the worst things we face is ending up outcast and alone .
For a huge portion of the world , boldness can take a person as far as death .
` Anodyne Sea ' reminds us that we all end up the same - eventually buried in the ground .
So we might as well overcome our fear and stand up to live a life of meaning despite the consequence . ''
