This propulsive cut finds Marling turning into a sultry seductress as she openly admits to accepting temptation .
Once I Was an Eagle follows a central figure , who angrily shuns and love , and over the course of the album regains a `` second naivety '' .
The record was written in three tunings , which mark the basic changes in emotion .
From the opening track to this song there is a darker , more melancholic tone , whereas the second half has a more upbeat tenor .
The song 's music video takes place in a Victorian-styled country manor and a shadowy forest .
It finds Marling teaming up with Fred Scott and Nick Davies , the same pair who directed her `` Master Hunter '' clip and When Brave Bird Saved short film .
