Cole originally recorded this song in 2007 in his bedroom , featuring three of his own verses .
Drake got to hear the tune after it leaked onto the net and he texted Cole saying he loved it .
The North Carolina rapper told the Toronto lyricist he had actually been thinking about reworking the song and according to MTV News Drake responded : `` Save me 16 .
`` Cole asked the song 's producers , L&X Music , for the file containing the song 's beat .
He tweaked it with a breakdown and some other additions to `` take it to the next level . ''
Drake then sent Cole his verse and it finally ended up on his 2010 mixtape Friday Night Lights .
He later included it as a track on his debut album Cole World : The Sideline Story .
