This song seems to be about a troubled person , with many bad experiences in life , who finds solace , somewhere ; Perhaps a friend or partner who bolsters his own confidence and resolve .
Whatever the case , the song certainly speaks of breaking through times of adversity and strife , of overcoming the memories of the hard times in the past .
