This burbling Techno tune was debuted by Nine Inch Nails at Fuji Rock Festival in July 2013 .
It was then played as the opening song at the band 's other 2013 festival shows including Chicago 's Lollapalooza and San Francisco 's Outside Lands .
Though frontman Trent Reznor hates discussing the meaning of his songs , he revealed to The Sun the pivotal moment for this stark , electro track .
`` Over the last few years , '' he explained , `` I 've found a level of comfort , completeness and fulfillment from things I would have dismissed at earlier points in my life as being boring and mundane . ''
`` I 'm referring to family life , '' Reznor continued , `` spending time at home , being centered somewhere , loving somebody and feeling love toward a child . ''
`` Before , I was trying to find the most extreme things I could experience .
Then I found myself questioning these new feelings .
Is this real ?
Am I really feeling this or am I allowing what 's been indoctrinated in me through society and media ? ''
`` Have I given up ?
That 's where the initial feeling in the song came from . ''
