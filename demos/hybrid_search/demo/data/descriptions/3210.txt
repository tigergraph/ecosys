Will.i.am 's second single from his fourth studio album pairs him with vocalist Eva Simons .
The Dutch singer first broke through when her song `` Silly Boy '' hit the singles chart of several European countries .
Her 2010 collaboration with AfroJack , `` Take Over Control , '' charted in both the UK and US .
The song was premiered on Capital FM on May 14 , 2012 .
Will.I.am said of the song 's development : `` I just finished this song a couple of days ago on my laptop because times have changed .
Then we filmed the video two days ago here in London and we edited it on laptops .
`` The Black Eyed Peas rapper added : `` I 've been doing this song since New Year 's but taking my time with it , with Steve and Eva , then it 's finished on my laptop . ''
Will.i.am recorded the song 's `` Hell yeah ! ''
refrain during a New Year 's Eve show in Las Vegas .
This was will.i.am 's first solo chart-topper in the UK .
He said : `` I 've had Number Ones before with the Black Eyed Peas , but to me this one means so much , because I know people thought I can only be successful in the Black Eyed Peas , they were wrong . ''
Will.i.am produced the dance track alongside Greek-Swedish DJ Steven Angello , who is also a member of the house music group Swedish House Mafia .
Simons told MTV News about her collaboration with will.i.am : `` We were in the studio , and he had this track , '' she recalled .
`` And he 's like , ` Yo , Eva , would you like to do this song with me ? '
And we had been recording a couple tracks before , so he knows what I 'm capable of and he trusts me , and we do n't really know each other for that long , but he trusts me.I recorded it , '' she continued .
`` And he mixes it straight away from his laptop ... and it 's done .
That 's so beautiful -- not only is he super creative and knows what he wants , but he also sees when other people are creative as well .
He 's not afraid to collaborate . ''
Will.i.am told Billboard magazine why he wanted to collaborate with Simons on this song .
`` Eva Simons is , hands down , the princess of dance music , '' he said .
`` She was doing it way before everyone was doing it , and she produces her own self .
She picks her own effects .
She records herself .
We have conversations like , ` So what compressors do you use ? '
She sings wonderfully , she writes wonderfully , she 's sexy .
She is the real thing .
It 's exactly what dance music is about .
That 's why I 'm so happy and honored to be working with her . ''
