The second single by the British Pop group Take That from their first EP , Progressed , features Robbie Williams and Gary Barlow on lead vocals .
The song was released to radio on July 11 , 2011 and made available as a digital download in the UK on August 22 , 2011 .
The Paul Gore directed music video was shot over two nights in black and white and features Take That singing the song in a vacant , post-show Wembley arena after performing their Progress Live concerts .
The tune also serves as the theme song for the Paul W.S. Anderson directed film adaptation of The Three Musketeers .
The song was written after Take That watched a private screening of the movie .
Gary Barlow stated : `` The film is visually so rich and beautiful that our main challenge was to then match it musically .
We 've returned to guitars , real pianos and a conventional song structure to achieve this .
We also thought that the Musketeers reminded us of ourselves . ''
Gary Barlow told the story of the song on his website : `` We were all at Rob -LRB- Williams -RRB- 's house in LA , we were spending a week there getting Progressed as finished as possible before tour rehearsals started .
We were invited to see a screening from an English director to a film called The 3 Musketeers .
We 'd been to see X-Men only a few days earlier and wondered if one film was enough !
We went along anyway and all loved it .
The superwarm and beautiful 3D gave us all a directional idea .
To retreat back to acoustic guitars , strings and piano for a song !!! We went up to Rob 's and got cracking .
By the end of the day we had ` Young . '
We demoed and took it home for Stuart Price to start work .
We did guitars , piano and kit at my studio while Stuart worked on the synths .
We also spent ages doing lots of vocals to give it one last try at being a boy band !
It feels like a hint to where TT land when approaching their next studio album .
Back to real instruments with less tempo and lyrics with an emotion edge . ''
