This was written by Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine for the soundtrack of the action/fantasy video game NeverDead .
It was used in its promotional trailer , marking the third time in five years that the band contributed a new song towards promoting a video game ; `` Gears Of War '' in 2006 to promote the game of the same name and `` Sudden Death '' in 2010 for inclusion in Guitar Hero : Warriors of Rock were the other two .
The song was subsequently included as on the band 's 2011 album , TH1RT3EN .
Bassist Dave Ellefson recalled to MusicRadar.com the first time Mustaine played him the song 's riff .
`` It was so violent and in your face , '' he said , `` it reminded me of the Peace Sells album .
In particular , it sounded a little like ` Good Mourning/Black Friday ' , but in a great new way .
I loved it .
`` Mustaine then put the song aside and forgot about it .
When the band got together in early 2011 to work on the album , Ellefson reminded him of his demo , but Mustaine could n't remember it .
`` Fortunately , he had recorded it on his BlackBerry , so he was able to find it , '' Ellefson told MusicRadar .
`` As soon as we all started playing it for real , we were like four little kids jumping around a room .
It 's such a strong riff .
It 's so huge , you ca n't help but get crazy when you hear it . ''
