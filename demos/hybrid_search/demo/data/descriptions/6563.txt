In 2010 Martin came out as gay , ending years of fan speculation on the topic .
This song refers to his public acknowledgment of his homosexuality .
Said the Puerto Rican singer : `` I can be anything but a liar .
Some people say , ` So Ricky , you 've been lying all along . '
And I say , ` No , I 'm not a liar . '
The song says : I 'm not a liar , this is my reality .
In my eyes you see I have nothing to hide .
And maybe you 'll love me .
Maybe not .
After all this , I would understand .
It 's not written for any one in particular in my mind .
Perhaps even for myself . ''
