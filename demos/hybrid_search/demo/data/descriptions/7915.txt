Like the other tracks on Transition , this song was inspired by `` a summer of secret love '' with a mystery woman .
Leslie explained to Global Grind : '' I wrote this song when I reflected on my relationship and found it crazy how I ended up dating a woman I had already met but ignored cause I had another girlfriend . ''
