On June 18 , 2006 , Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo married Kyoko Ito , whom he had known since March 1997 .
This song was written by him about the difficulties of adjusting to married life .
He explained to Spin magazine : '' ` Unspoken ' was written right after I got married and after living alone for so many years , having everything exactly how I wanted it , suddenly I 'm living with somebody else and I have to start making compromises in my lifestyle and boy , part of my mind was really unhappy about having to compromise .
It was just a real adjustment coming from my previous lifestyle . ''
