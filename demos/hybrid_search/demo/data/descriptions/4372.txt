Adam Schlesinger said of this track : `` Our attorney Josh Grier works at a big fancy law firm with a big fancy waiting room .
One day we were sitting there waiting and there was a magazine called California Lawyer on the coffee table facing us .
Chris -LRB- Collingwood -RRB- said , apropos of nothing , `` California sex lawyer . ''
Perhaps it was only because we were sitting in a quiet office , but at the time it seemed like the funniest thing in the world .
Why it needed to be turned into a song , I 'm still not sure . ''
