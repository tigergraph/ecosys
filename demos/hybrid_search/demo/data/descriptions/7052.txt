The title track of Mac Miller 's debut album is named after the rapper 's favorite childhood hangout , a section of Frick Park in his home city of Pittsburgh .
It 's known as Blue Slide Park because of the blue slide carved into a small hill .
Blue Slide Park was released through Rostrum Records , and was the first independently-distributed debut album by an act to reach # 1 on the Billboard 200 for 16 years .
The last -LRB- and only previous -RRB- time this happened was back in 1995 when Snoop associates Tha Dogg Pound 's Dogg Food , which was independently distributed via Priority , debuted at the summit .
Miller told MTV News that his team preferred to do things on their own .
`` I never really got far enough to see an offer for real , '' he said .
`` I got no hatred towards major labels or anything .
I never got a chance to hear what they had to say .
We just really wanted to stick with our home team and keep it in the family . ''
Mac 's older brother , Miller McCormick , designed the album cover .
