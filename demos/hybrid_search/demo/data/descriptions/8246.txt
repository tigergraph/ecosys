This mournful ballad finds Hannah Blaylock comparing a relationship on the rocks to the Last Supper of Jesus Christ .
`` You break the bread and you break my heart , you raise the glass , we fall apart , '' she sings .
Blaylock co-wrote this song with Nashville songwriters Catt Gravitt and Danny Myrick .
Mandolin and banjo player Cherrill Green recalled : `` Usually at the end of a writing session we send our newly written song out to each other and at the end of a month or so , we get together and talk about songs we have each been writing .
But sometimes when we have been writing a lot during a particular week , we forget to send a song around here and there .
That happened with ` Last Supper . '
Hannah pulled this song out and said , ` here 's a song I wrote a couple of weeks ago ! '
I started flipping out that I had n't heard it yet !
I loved everything about it .
We all knew it had to go on the record ! ''
