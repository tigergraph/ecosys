This is the title track of the fifteenth studio album by the American Country music artist Kenny Chesney .
The song and album title came from a conversation Chesney had with some of his football-playing friends at the Red Bar , a beach hangout in Grayton Beach , Florida , and the constant stream of fans he encountered once they arrived there .
He explained to USA Today : `` We walked in , and it was packed .
There was about 20 minutes of people coming up , saying hello , wanting to get something signed .
After that died down , one of those guys said , ' I did n't realize your life was like this . '
I said , ` Hey , man , welcome to the fishbowl . '
As soon as I said it , I realized that I was going to write a song about how our world and our culture is shrinking . ''
The song finds Chesney singing about the way modern celebrity culture has made it so that `` everybody 's business is everybody 's business . ''
Chesney told USA Today that he does n't let his fellow celebrities off the hook on this cut .
`` At the end of the song I speak to celebrities and say , ` You asked for this , ' '' he noted .
`` But you do n't have to be in the public eye for your business to be everybody 's business .
And that 's just the way it is . ''
