Tricky explained the title of this song on his record label 's website : `` Joseph is one of two songs I 've named after the tune 's lead singer .
I met him outside a food shop in LA. .
He was a busker .
Problem is ... I 've lost his details .
I have no idea where this kid is now .
So I called it Joseph so , hopefully , he hears it somewhere and gets in touch .
` Cos I want to work with him again . ''
