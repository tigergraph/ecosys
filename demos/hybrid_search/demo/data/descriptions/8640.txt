Snow Patrol 's second single from their sixth album is a lighter-in-the-air anthem that finds them returning to their traditional sound after the electronica elements of their previous single , `` Called Out In The Dark . ''
It was released on November 13 , 2011 .
The song 's music video finds Snow Patrol becoming a house band .
The Brett Simon directed clip was filmed in a tango club in Buenos Aires , Argentina .
Frontman Gary Lightbody explained the song 's meaning to The Sun : `` It 's three stories in one - each verse is a different person in my life that was going through a difficult time .
Then the chorus is about trying to explain that everything is n't as bad as it might seem . ''
Lightbody told Billboard magazine that he wrote this song `` to try to protect '' the three people experiencing difficulties , adding that he wanted , `` to show them that there were people there for them whenever they needed .
Sometimes it 's hard to reach out , it 's hard to ask for help .
It 's a recurring theme on the record . ''
