This is one of the poppier tracks on Maccabees third album Given To The Wild .
Guitarist Hugo White explained to NME : `` We 'd been working on ` Unknow ' and ` Heave ' and it was like , these are ... pieces .
Scary pieces .
This was a reaction , though not in a negative way .
It really found its place on the album . ''
