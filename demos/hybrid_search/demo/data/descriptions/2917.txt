Speaking to The Observer , Coxon explained this lo-fi sneer was inspired by a night out at a house party in Brentwood which went horribly wrong .
He and his two pals took off the tape that was playing and put on a Smiths album .
`` And then we danced about in quite a ... ` faggy ' way , for want of a better word , '' he said .
They got really beaten up as a result .
`` We 'd all of us thought we would probably get off with one of our friend 's cousins at the party and , well , no , '' Coxon concluded .
