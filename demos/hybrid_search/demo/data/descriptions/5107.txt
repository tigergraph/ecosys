Pavonis Mons is a volcano on the surface of Mars .
That may not seem like much , but Mars contains the largest volcanoes in the solar system .
It is very difficult to approach Pavonis Mons by balloon , as Mars has a very thin atmosphere .
NASA projects even involve flying a robotic balloon probe to explore rough terrain like Valles Marineris .
So , please , do not try this at home .
