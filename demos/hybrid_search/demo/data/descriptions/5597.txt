This is the title track from 2010 American Idol winner Lee DeWyze 's debut album .
The song was written by DeWyze with help from Toby Gad , whose other credits include Beyonc√© 's `` If I Were a Boy '' and Fergie 's `` Big Girls Do n't Cry . ''
The other co-writer was Lindy Robbins who also co-penned Demi Lovato 's hit single , `` Here We Go Again . ''
Gad and Robbins teamed up the previous year to write `` I Need To Know '' for the 2009 American Idol winner Kris Allen 's debut album .
DeWyze co-wrote 10 of `` Live It Up 's 11 tracks , and this was the song that kick-started the process .
He explained to Billboard Magazine : `` When I first started talking to -LRB- label -RRB- people , I told them , ' I just think that it 's going to be more me and it 's gon na progress better if I have a hand in the writing process , and they were like , ` Well , go write and let 's see what happens . '
And so we went into the studio and -LRB- the song -RRB- ` Live It Up ' came about .
I brought that to the table and they were very happy with it , so that 's what kick-started the whole thing . ''
This was initially chosen to be the lead single for the Live It Up album , but DeWyze switched to `` Sweet Serendipity '' shortly before the release .
In a telephone interview with radio host Ryan Seacrest , DeWyze explained why he changed his mind , saying that he played the song for a lot of people , and he felt that `` Serendipity '' is the one that stood out the most .
He added that whilst both songs have some similar `` Jason Mraz vibes , '' `` Live It Up '' is a bit more sleepy than `` Serendipity . ''
DeWyze achieved an unwanted record when Live It Up debuted at # 19 on the Billboard album chart with sales of just 39,000 , the poorest-selling debut from an Idol champ to date .
