This song finds New York rapper Angel Haze coolly announcing that she runs the Big Apple over tense , stark beats .
She told NME : `` The whole point of the song ` New York ' is to actually convey that I am a threat to everyone .
Not just to single females , but to boys too .
I 'm inspired by New York : it 's where I live , where I write .
I actually wrote New York exactly as it says in the song : ` rooftop Brooklyn on covert street ' .
We put it out and no-one had the expectation that it would blow up the way it did . ''
