This lament about the inevitable passing of time was one of the first songs that Fall Out Boy worked on after their hiatus .
Bassist and lyricist Pete Wentz told Kerrang !
magazine : `` I remember thinking we needed a ` Dance , Dance ' / ` This Ai n't A Scene , It 's An Arms Race ' type song that emanated that kind of feeling . ''
Wentz explained the song 's meaning to Kerrang !
: `` Having spent time in that dance music scene , I saw a lot of people who were there for the wrong reasons , and that always ends up really sad and weird .
On top of that , on a meta-level , the thing we came from -- whatever you wan na call it -- kinda is n't there so much any more .
So there 's a little aspect of that to it . ''
