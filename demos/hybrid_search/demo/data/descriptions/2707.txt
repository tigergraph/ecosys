This song was kick-started by vocalist James Skelly mistaking his brother Ian 's demo lyric for `` I used to call ` at ' the Roving Jewel '' rather than `` I used to call ` her ' the Roving Jewel . ''
The misunderstanding changed James 's train of thought and , within minutes , he 'd come up with a totally new narrative for the song .
`` It 's about this fella who was trying to write the ultimate piece of literature about his life , '' explained James to Spinner UK .
`` He goes to this place to write it but ends up going insane trying to write , so decides to give up art in the end because he realises he ca n't write about a life if he 's not living one .
It 's like The Shining or something .
Sometimes you just have to put whatever it is down and live your life . ''
