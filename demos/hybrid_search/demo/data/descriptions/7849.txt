This is the first of a series of I 'm With You outtakes released as singles .
`` We just wanted them to come out because we just really like them , '' drummer Chad Smith told Billboard magazine .
`` We did n't want them to get lost , so we 're gon na put them out , mainly for our fans .
They would 've waited for the Warner Bros. box set in , like , 2020 , if there 's even a record company around then .
I 'm glad they 're going to see the light of day because it 's an important part of the band and what we were doing at the time . ''
The song was released as a double sided seven-inch vinyl pressing and digital download along with `` Strange Man '' on August 14 , 2012 .
Smith described `` Long Progression '' as `` kind of a flowing , kind of midtempo funk '' track that , `` almost made the record . ''
He explained to Billboard magazine that it was replaced on I 'm With You by `` Goodbye Hooray . ''
