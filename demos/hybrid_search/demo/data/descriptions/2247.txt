Though penned by different writers -LRB- Lee Brice/Billy Montana/Jon Stone -RRB- , Chesney sees this song as a sequel to his 2005 # 1 country hit `` Anything But Mine . ''
He explained to Billboard magazine : `` To me , when I heard that song it was like ` Anything But Mine , ' chapter two .
It was like the next phase of that guy 's life .
I know I have that person in my life , and I think everybody 's got that person in their life , that they were with a short time and had no idea the impact that short time would have on them .
No matter how you live , no matter where you go in your life , no matter who you 're with later on , those seven days or that little time frame that you 're with them made more of an impact than you even knew at the time .
I think that 's very powerful and that 's what this song 's about . ''
Chesney told NPR about this confessional track .
`` I think everybody in his life has that one person that they ca n't mentally get rid of , '' he said .
`` Maybe we 're with someone romantically and emotionally even for a short time .
The character of this song , it was seven days of his life , a week .
I think we all have those people and the time that we 're with them , we have no idea the impact that they 're going to have on our lives later on .
And I have that person .
I think that a lot of people do . ''
