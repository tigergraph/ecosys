An homage to the surf music the Beach Boys helped make so popular , this song is certainly one directly from the depths of Gin Blossom Jesse Valenzuela 's heart .
`` You know what really it is , '' adds the songwriter , `` it 's sort of bittersweet , because I was living here in California , and my wife 's mother got very ill back in Lawrence , Kansas , and she had to go stay with her .
It was before my son was in school , so they left .
It was wintertime , and they went to Kansas to stay for six months .
And I always go back and forth , I was on the road , I had to work .
And we were in the middle of remodeling our house , and so I was living in my garage , which is a studio , and it was the rainiest winter in 20 years .
And I really missed them both , and so I wrote a song about that . ''
Jesse 's original role with the Gin Blossoms was as lead singer .
He switched to guitar with the introduction of vocalist Robin Wilson to the band .
Yet he was - and is - one of the band 's most prolific songwriters .
While some artists may have a rough time of it allowing someone else to sing their words when they themselves are perfectly capable of doing it , Jesse says it does n't bother him .
Quoting his great long-time friend , JD Souther -LRB- songwriter for the Eagles and Jackson Browne , among others -RRB- , Jesse says , `` He 's been asked that same question .
And he says , ` No , man , that 's cool .
Whoever wants to sing them is fine with me . '
And I 'll tell you what , he sings them beautifully .
`` On this song , however , it was a different situation , probably because the song is so special to him .
`` I turned in the demo with me singing it , '' recounts Jesse , `` and the label says , ` Can we just leave it like this ?
Because we love the way you sound on it .
You sound so earnest , like it really means something to you . '
I 'm just fine with that . ''
