This solo number by Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke is from the soundtrack for the 2009 romantic fantasy , New Moon .
Like all the other songs this is original and exclusive to the soundtrack and was chosen by music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas .
A relationship had already been established between Yorke and Patsavas , as the Radiohead track `` 15 Step '' was licensed the previous year for the end credits of Twilight .
Patsavas recalled to Billboard magazine : `` Early on in the summer I was speaking quite a bit to -LSB- Bryce Edge , Yorke 's manager -RSB- and he said Thom had something already recorded that would be appropriate for the -LSB- New Moon -RSB- movie .
I was thrilled . ''
