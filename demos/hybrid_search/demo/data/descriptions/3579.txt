The album follows the theme of learning what a relationship can be .
Nathanson explained to Glide Magazine that this song was about the time when the relationship reached its lowest point .
Said Nathanson : `` The way that the record works , it moves like a story -- I did n't really mean for it to -- but it moves like a relationship .
The intent of how great you want it to be and how alive you feel .
And then kind of having it dip back down and head back in a more realistic way , kind of like fiction to reality .
` Bulletproof Weeks ' is kind of the moment in the record definitely at the bottom of the barrel .
Like when you 're now realizing , ` F -- k ... I ... .
I 'm not going to get this back .
It 's gone . '
And whatever is going to come out of this is going to be significantly different than what it is now .
So ` Bulletproof Weeks ' is kind of that resignation moment of like , ` Ok , this is where it is , and it 's not coming back . ' ''
