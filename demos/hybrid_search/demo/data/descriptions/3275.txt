This song is pretty much what it says on the tin .
It is all about having `` no values , '' having `` nothing to say '' and not caring about what anyone else thinks .
Songwriter , Gregg Ginn , spoke to Ripper about this track : `` It 's not ABOUT anything .
It comes from just feeling like what 's in the song , rather than some kind of political thing .
It 's an emotional concept of a feeling at a certain time . ''
Henry Rollins elaborated : `` Our songs are personal .
They 're not about issues .
They 're about what 's in our heads . ''
This song originally appeared on Black Flag 's second EP , Jealous Again , released in 1980 .
This was the one and only Black Flag record to feature Ron Reynes on vocals .
Reynes was recruited after Black Flag 's former vocalist , Keith Morris , suddenly quit at the start of the EP 's recording sessions .
Morris ' version of `` No Values '' can be found on Black Flag 's 1982 compilation album , Everything Went Black .
