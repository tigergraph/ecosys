At 6:26 this is the longest track on Green Day 's ¡ Uno !
, ¡ Dos !
, and ¡ Tré !
trilogy .
The song is the band , `` going all over the place , '' said Billie Joe Armstrong to UK newspaper The Sun .
`` It 's an arena song then a sing-along and it takes off .
We wanted to make something similar to ` Jesus Of Suburbia ' or a b-side off The Beatles ' Abbey Road .
It 's a number of songs combined that make a giant sing-along and something you can dance to . ''
