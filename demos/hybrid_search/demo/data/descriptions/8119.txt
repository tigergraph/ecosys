The lead single from girl group The Saturdays ' fourth studio album signaled a new dance-pop direction for the five-piece .
The song , which was released on May 22 , 2011 in the UK , was described by Pop Justice as , `` a bit Black Eyed Peas-esque , feels a tiny bit like Kelis and Rihanna , and has a strong , propulsive energy that builds throughout the tune . ''
The song 's music video was filmed in Los Angeles in April 2011 and finds the girls dressed in office attire before letting their hair down in a club .
It was the second clip that the girls had recorded in LA , after `` Higher . ''
The song was produced by prolific hitmaker Steve Mac , who has credits on numerous UK # 1 singles and albums for artists such as Westlife , Gareth Gates and Leona Lewis .
He also previously helmed The Saturdays ' hit single `` Ego . ''
Norwegian songwriter Ina Wroldsen , who has penned many of The Saturdays ' hits , is the credited songwriter .
Here 's what Mollie King and Una Healy from The Saturdays had to say about the track during an interview with Digital Spy : Mollie : `` It 's obviously still pop , but it 's got more of a dance beat behind it .
It 's about when you step on to the dancefloor and transform into a completely different person - when you turn into a bad girl !
`` Una : `` Dance is massive at the moment so it 's a dance track , but it also has something unique behind it .
It 's got this drop-out chorus where it 's just the beat and you can only hear our voices - there are n't many tracks like that , so it 's a bit different . ''
