Jackson explained : `` I remember writing ` Earth Song ' when I was in Austria , in a hotel .
And I was feeling so much pain and so much suffering of the plight of the Planet Earth .
And for me , this is Earth 's Song , because I think nature is trying so hard to compensate for man 's mismanagement of the Earth .
And with the ecological unbalance going on , and a lot of the problems in the environment , I think earth feels the pain , and she has wounds , and it 's about some of the joys of the planet as well .
But this is my chance to pretty much let people hear the voice of the planet .
And this is ` Earth Song . '
And that 's what inspired it .
And it just suddenly dropped into my lap when I was on tour in Austria . ''
This is Jackson 's biggest hit in the UK , selling 1,038,821 copies .
The single sold over three million copies worldwide .

When Jackson sang this at the 1996 Brit awards with a choir of children , he struck a Christ-like pose that did not go over well with Pulp lead singer Jarvis Cocker , who jumped on stage in protest of Jackson 's `` Messiah Complex . ''
Cocker disrupted the performance , lifting his shirt and making a gesture with his butt .
Said Cocker , `` Rock stars have got big enough egos without trying to be Jesus . ''
Jackson performed this for the first time in November 1995 on the German celebrity game show Wan na Bet ? .
