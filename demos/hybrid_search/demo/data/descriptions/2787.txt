In a 2004 interview , Geddy Lee explained : `` We were touring a lot with Kiss in those days , and they had a song called ' I think I 'm goin ' Blind -LSB- just goin ' blind -RSB- . '
So we were talking the piss out of that title by just coming up with this .
Pratt -LRB- a nickname for Neil Peart -RRB- came up with this line , ' I think I 'm going bald , ' because Alex is always worried about losing his hair , even when he was not losing his hair .
So he would try all kinds of ingredients to put on his scalp .
And I think it just got Neil thinking about aging , even though we were n't aging yet and had no right to talk about that kind of stuff yet .
It would be much more appropriate now .
And it just became a kind of funny song , even though the song is not funny , in terms of sentiment , it kind of is , and the music is really goofy .
A lot of people mistake us for being deadly serious , but some of our songs are just plain goofy . ''
