Co-Producer Dave Okumu , whose day job is the frontman for UK Alt-Rock act The Invisible , did all the rapping and backing vocals on Devotion .
Ware told Digital Spy about his contribution to this song : '' ` No To Love ' is very repetitive and almost has a Hip-Hop style loop .
We were deciding whether I could get away with putting a rapper on it , but in the end we went with Dave .
He 's never rapped before but I think it 's brilliant !
It 's classy . ''
