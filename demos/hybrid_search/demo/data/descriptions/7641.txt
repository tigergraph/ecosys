Frontman Alan Donohoe told the Independent newspaper May 9 , 2008 about the background to this song : `` I still had my office job for the NHS at the Royal Free Hospital and I 'd used all my year 's holiday to go on tour with the band .
It was very stressful - heavy partying and coming back to heavy jobs - and that song was my transition from humble NHS office worker into fully fledged rock 'n' roll star .
It summed up the , albeit temporary , mild depression of a stressful , busy month . ''
