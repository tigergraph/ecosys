Mario described this song to Twist magazine as `` the most personal sounding record on the album . ''
He explained : `` It 's personal because I say things in the record that have multiple meanings .
Like the chorus says , ' A man that ai n't afraid to cry is a man that 's not afraid to die . '
That to me , even though I 'm talking about a relationship in the song , I 'm talking about that point in a relationship where everything is over .
It 's like , you guys are cool , you guys are friends , but you 're totally going separate ways .
That 's probably one of the hardest things a young man and young woman can go through in their relationship .
And , so that 's what I 'm saying in that line .
But it also means to me that a strong man is not afraid to be vulnerable , to cry and let it out .
I just felt it was a line that people can connect with . ''
