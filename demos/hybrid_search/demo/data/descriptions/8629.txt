Artist Direct asked Keyboardist J-Dog about this track .
He replied : `` That song is just about being up in the club , fool -LSB- Laughs -RSB- !
We actually wrote those lyrics a long time ago .
We used to go to clubs a lot when we were back home , so we wanted a song that people could play in clubs and dance to -- bitches be shakin ' their titties to it and s -- t -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
It 's really about us partying at clubs .
We used to do that a lot .
It 's making fun of all the songs that repeat themselves saying things like , ` Shake it like a salt shaker ! '
That kind of stuff was dominant at the time that we wrote those lyrics .
All of those songs keep repeating the same things , so this is us making fun of that . ''
