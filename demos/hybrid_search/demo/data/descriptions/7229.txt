PWT 's principal singer and song writer Tom Higgenson told the story behind this song to Alternative Press magazine : `` This track was written for a girl I had been with for more than a decade .
I was trying to describe that feeling you get when you wake up in the morning expecting her to be laying beside you and your heart sinks when you remember she 's gone .
I thought it would be interesting to have the body parts mourning their loss together .
Sometimes a breakup hurts all over , and that 's what I was trying to put into words . ''
If you 're wondering why this made the `` songs that are also the names of movies '' list , you have n't seen the 1991 film Body Parts , about a man who loses his arm in a car accident , and gets a new one that came from an executed serial killer .
What could possibly go wrong ?
This was the first song written for The Wonders of the Younger .
Said Higgenson : `` I originally recorded the demo with my friend Adam at home in Austin , Texas , and it was probably the first song I sent to the band for this album . ''
