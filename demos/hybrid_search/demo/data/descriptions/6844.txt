Frontman Nathan Leone told Kerrang !
April 4 , 2009 about this song : `` As a band you get attention , and when you do , people come out of the woodwork to criticise you .
When we started this band , we did n't think about the negative-you go out there to do something positive and affect people in a positive way - but it seems there are always little arrows that try and attack you . ''
Leone added that this song , `` is about seeking revenge on the people that pick on you . ''
