3 Doors Down singer Brad Arnold explained the background to this heartfelt ballad in an interview with Artist Direct : `` It 's not actually about me .
It 's about somebody very close to me going through a time in their life and they needed to put someone behind them .
When it 's time to do that , you have to ultimately let the person go and get back to yourself .
That 's one of the more meaningful songs to me .
I know what the person was going through , and I tried to put it into words .
I think it was therapeutic for both of us . ''
