This is the title track of Matt Cardle 's second album .
The 2010 X Factor winner penned the song with Eg White -LRB- Will Young 's `` Leave Right Now '' and Adele 's `` Chasing Pavements '' -RRB- and singer-songwriter Jack McManus -LRB- The Wanted 's `` Warzone '' and Ed Sheeran 's `` U.N.I. '' -RRB- .
Cardle told his former X Factor mentor Dannii Minogue that he sings about his life after winning the reality singing show on the album .
`` I think the first album - because of the situation I was in before the show - afterwards I was drawing on stuff and inspiration of stuff that happened before that , '' said the singer .
`` I was n't going to write about The X Factor or things like that .
But ever since the first album came out , I 've actually been in situations that I 've drawn inspiration from , and so this -LSB- album -RSB- is all about now . ''
