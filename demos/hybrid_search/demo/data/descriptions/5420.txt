Will Young revealed on his record label 's website that he jokingly refers to this as `` the stalker song . ''
He explained : `` It 's such a declaration of love , it could be misconstrued , someone could actually be arrested for this and not be allowed within a mile of the object of their affection !
It 's about seeing someone who is right for you and making yourself vulnerable and saying exactly what you feel .
It 's actually a very brave song . ''
This was produced by Young 's frequent collaborator Eg White together with UK dance production duo The Freemasons .
Young explained on his record label 's website : `` I think very carefully about who to collaborate with .
Eg found this brilliant string section in Nashville , the Love Sponge Strings , and their arrangement is quite fantastic but we needed a bit more rhythm .
You would n't really associate The Freemasons with me but it works , because its like a disco track led by the strings .
We 've kept it really sparse , so the strings almost joust with the vocals . ''
