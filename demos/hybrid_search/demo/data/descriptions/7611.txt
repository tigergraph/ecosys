This track is about the legendary daredevil high-wire circus act , The Flying Wallendas , who refused to perform with a safety net , even when it started costing them their lives in fatal accidents .
The troupe 's founder , Karl Wallenda -LRB- 1905-1978 -RRB- , continued to perform and refused to retire even after the deaths of many in his family .
At the age of 73 , he too fell to his death .
In his obduracy , co-frontman Patterson Hood clearly sees something of Drive-By Truckers own rugged determination to go their own way .
Hood said in the album 's liner notes : `` I never really was all that into the circus as a kid , but I sure was into the Rock Show , which was sort of The Circus for kids of my generation .
I went and wanted to join .
I 've been living on the road for much of the last two decades .
I get tired and burned out , but I would n't trade it for anything . ''
