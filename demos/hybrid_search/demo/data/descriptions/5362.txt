Vocalist/guitarist James Petralli told UK music magazine the NME about this Rock-Operaesque tune , which veers into prog territory : `` I do n't think we 'll ever go full-on prog but all of us like to be challenged in that way .
We listen to a lot of Soft Machine and a lot of Yes .
Prog music is challenging and hilarious and we 've always wanted to do something which walks that line .
` Anvil Everything ' was our attempt to fulfil a bit of a prog fantasy , to see if we could make it acceptable . ''
