This song is about personal insecurity and self-doubt , and having the tenacity to break through the fear .
Vocalist Alex Varkatzas admitted in publicity materials : `` I 'm honestly not sure what scares me more .
That 's a lot for people to grasp .
Am I not giving it my all ?
Have I pulled back in the past because I feared failing on my own ?
Or am I just not good enough ?
But we 're all human and that 's how we learn : it builds heart and character .
Tenacity has got me where I am , not talent .
Whether that alienates people or makes me look stupid ... I ca n't help it . ''
