Alyssa penned this song in her bedroom after breaking up with her first proper boyfriend .
She told 4Music : `` It 's really embarrassing , but it 's one of my favourite songs on the album , and it means a lot to me .
And it shows people who I am - not only as an artist , but a person .
And I think that would connect me to people . ''
Alyssa told 4Music that not only has her former boyfriend heard the song , `` but he knows that the entire album is about him .
And he tried to come back . ''
