Brooks explained to CMT about this song : `` It 's just one of those fantasy things I think most guys , in the back of their mind , would like to run into .
As Ronnie -LRB- Dunn -RRB- describes it , that good-looking girl standing on the side of the highway with her thumb out .
Just this wild girl . ''
