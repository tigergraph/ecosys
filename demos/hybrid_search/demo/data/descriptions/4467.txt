After 14 years of making music and six albums together , this is the first true Tegan & Sara collaboration .
The pair usually choose to write separately but decided to try to write together for the first time during a trip to New Orleans .
This was the only song from the trip to make it onto the record but the pair considered the collaboration a success - even if it was , at times , trying .
`` It certainly illuminated for me the differences between our writing styles , '' Sara told The Canadian Press .
Tegan told Billboard magazine that the duo found their writing styles were not particularly compatible , with Sara by far the more `` meticulous '' of the two .
However , with this song the twins , who live on opposite sides of their native Canada , discovered they could work together if they were n't in the same room .
`` We 've been sharing files and sending MP3s back and forth and collaborating that way , '' she said .
`` We find it easier .
But I 'm glad we did try to sit in a room together and do it so we could see how we each worked .
I felt proud we were able to do it without being arrested or killing each other . ''
Sara summed up the process to MTV News with one word : `` Awkward .
Not just because it was Tegan , -LSB- but -RSB- I do n't think I would project a level of comfort with anyone .
It 's such an intimate time .
I 've never approached music as a collaborative effort .
It 's one part of our career that we actually do alone . ''
Tegan added : `` Only one song we collaborated on made the final 13 .
But we wrote 51 songs , some together , some different .
It 's exciting to know there 's something to look forward to - that there will be more writing and collaboration . ''
