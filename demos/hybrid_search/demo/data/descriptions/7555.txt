Guitarist/vocalist Michael Poulsen told The Pulse of Radio the song was very personal to him .
`` I lost my father four , five years ago and I believe that every man in this universe , you know , they have their heroes and most of us are looking at our dad as a big hero , '' he explained .
`` And so , of course , I 'm singing about a little boy who lost his father , and then at the same time he loses his belief in his superheroes . ''
