This song , in which Natasha Khan -LRB- aka Bat For Lashes -RRB- calls for peace of mind to all her beloved , started life as a demo .
It was secretly recorded by Khan , whilst she was messing around with guitars in the studio with multi-instrumentalist Ben Christophers .
She later added an all-black , gay gospel choir from New York who , according to the press release , looked like `` Prince backing-singers from the '80s , '' and sounded like `` a ramshackle Persuasions . ''
