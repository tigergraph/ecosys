This was the first song to be heard from Bloodsports , Suede 's sixth studio album and their first since 2002 .
Speaking about the song frontman Brett Anderson told NME : '' ` Barriers ' is n't the first single but we are proud enough of it to just chuck it out there and thought that its pulsing , romantic swell somehow summed up the feel of the album quite nicely . ''
It was made available as a free download on January 7 , 2013 .
Regarding the album Anderson told NME : `` It 's about lust , it 's about the chase , it 's about the endless carnal game of love .
It was possibly the hardest we ever made but certainly is the most satisfying .
it 's ten furious songs for me , we have reclaimed what Suede was always about : drama , melody and noise . ''
