This is the second single from Country music singer Lee Ann Womack 's sixth studio album , Call Me Crazy .
The song peaked at # 39 on the Country chart .
Call Me Crazy has a dark vibe , with plenty of drinking and love lost , but Womack told Billboard magazine it was n't intentional : `` I try to go through the whole process with blinders on and just cut songs that really work for me .
Sometimes it ends up being different when I do n't even realize it 's different , '' she said .
`` It probably seems dark compared to what 's been made around here the last couple years .
I do n't think it 's dark compared to Hank Williams or George Jones .
It 's what I gravitate toward-songs that make you feel something . ''
The song was penned by American Country singer-songwriter , and actor , Waylon Payne .
He is best known to many for portraying Jerry Lee Lewis in the 2005 Oscar-winning Johnny Cash biopic , Walk The Line .
Payne explained that he wrote the song at a Los Angeles bar : `` I was out taking a walk and the song was weighing heavy on me , so I ducked into this bar called Numbers and wrote the song .
I later found out that the bar is a prostitute bar . ''
