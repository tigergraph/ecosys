Guitarist Benji Madden explained to Alternative Press that this tribute to hearing a female rock vocalist 's voice on the radio is `` about all the girls out there who make boys want to start bands and go on tour . ''
According to Benji , this song reminds him of late '70s and early '80s bands the Cars and Cheap Trick .
