Frontwoman Emily Haines discussed this track with Drowned in Sound : `` This song is the first of many that I wrote on the piano during my time in Buenos Aires .
It started out as a ballad but really came to life once we bumped up the tempo .
My favorite part of the song is the kick drum sound in the middle section , it sounds like the drums are being played in a cathedral in hell . ''
