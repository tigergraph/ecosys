Frontman Liam Fray explained to the Daily Mirror September 19 , 2008 how the Manchester band came to record this stand-alone single during a busy summer of taking their music to the masses .
Said Fray : `` We had three days off in June , but I do n't do days off , so we went into the studio and I started messing about on the acoustic .
The band said , ` What 's that , get it down on tape now . '
One thing lead to another and , without any pressure from the label , we just went and did it . ''
