This boisterous bluegrass banger has been a regular in Mumford & Sons ' live sets since early 2010 .
Keyboard player Ben Lovett told NME : `` With Lover of the Light , people would say to us , ` Oh , I ca n't wait to hear that chorus on record . '
But what they really meant by that is they ca n't wait to hear what they 've already heard .
But the songs gradually change - we push them into places that feel right for the four of us . ''
The song 's music video was filmed in Wales .
It stars and was directed by British actor Idris Elba , who is best known for playing Russell `` Stringer '' Bell in HBO 's The Wire and the titular character in the BBC 's mini-series Luther , for which he won a Golden Globe in 2012 .
The band do not feature in the clip at all , which was something they were happy about .
`` We met him -LRB- Elba -RRB- in a pub in London , and we had a chat , and talked about doing something that was , as a music video , very different from anything we 've done before , '' Marcus Mumford told MTV News .
`` Firstly , we would n't be in it , which is a real relief to us , and secondly , it would be kind of observational , rather than narrative .
Some people do n't really understand it , which is great , because all that we do is very understandable ... so it 's nice to have something that 's a little more challenging to understand . ''
