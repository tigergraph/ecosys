Nashville songwriters John Scott Sherrill and Steve Seskin wrote this song .
Says Sherrill : `` That was not from any deep personal experience , it was just a love song .
By that point , I had gotten remarried and I was n't as full of angst as I may have been a year earlier .
It was pretty easy to write a happy love song with Steve Seskin - he 's a happy kind of guy .
He 's terrific and jolly . ''
