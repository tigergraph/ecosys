The uptempo `` Spring Affair '' was the opening track from Donna Summer 's Four Seasons Of Love , and like the rest of this 1976 concept album , was co-written by the lady herself with Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte.The song runs to around 8 and a half minutes , but the radio edit single was around three and a half minutes.The latter was released in France , the Netherlands , Canada and her native America backed by `` Come With Me '' , although by this time she had been living in -LRB- then West -RRB- Germany for many years where the single was backed by a radio edit of `` Winter Melody '' , which was released elsewhere as an A Side .
