`` A Forest , '' from The Cure 's Seventeen Seconds album , tells a vague story of pursuit of a girl in a forest , which ends in loss .
Many fans and critics regard this song in particular as a good example of The Cure 's unique sound .
This song is behind a famous incident .
At the 1981 Werchter Festival in Belgium , The Cure was on before Robert Palmer and were just finishing their set .
Robert Palmer , apparently getting a little pushy , tried to have his road crew hurry The Cure off the stage .
Robert Smith responded by sassily informing the crowd that they could n't play anymore , then played an extra-long 9-minute version of `` A Forest . ''
Smith closed by shouting `` F -- k Robert Palmer '' to a cheering crowd !

This song represents several firsts for The Cure : It garnered them their first appearance on the BBC 's Top of the Pops program .
The album is also the only one to feature Matthieu Hartley on the keyboards exclusively .
And finally , it was the first Cure single to be released on the 12-inch single record format - the alternative 7-inch record single omits the initial guitar-and-keyboard introduction , skips a few bars between the verses , and it goes to a fade-out sooner in the guitar solo ending .
All this makes it two minutes shorter on the smaller single .
Trivia : How many record labels has The Cure released under ?
Seven !
That 's Fiction , Suretone , Geffen , Polydor , Elektra , Asylum , and Sire .
