Guitarist Anand Wilder explained to Drowned in Sound : '' ` Strange Reunions ' was a really stupid song that I wrote , and I cut it up and turned it into this really weird piece that goes from 5/4 to 6/4 to 5/4 back to 4/4 .
It was really my attempt at ridiculous time signature changes that bands like Dirty Projectors will effortlessly use in songs .
But the subject is the debate between atheists and super religious fundamentalist people and how they 'll never see eye to eye , they 'll be feuding forever . ''
