The title is an archaic military acronym that means `` kiss my ass , guys , you 're on your own . ''
Hayes wrote the song with Scott Davis and John Evans .
They found the term when they were looking through an old military dictionary .
Hayes was never in the military , but his father served in the Navy .
The song does n't glamorize the military experience , but instead shows how easy it can be to find yourself in uniform and wondering how you got there .
Carll has made it clear that he has great respect for military personnel - t concerts , he has dedicated the song to those who have served .
The song is a chorus-less narrative told from the perspective of a young man who finds himself in the army and goes though a hallucination when he is wounded in battle .
The `` KMAG YOYO '' lyric appears just once in the song , during a passage where the soldier things he is flying into space .
In our interview with Hayes Carll , he said , `` I thought it was a pretty great title because it just sums up the whole thing . ''
Carll adds that the acronym also fit the theme of the album , which is why it was used for the title .
He says that for a while , the whole album concept was `` somebody just checking out from society and moving out to the desert and saying , ` F -- k it , I 'm going on my own on this . ''
