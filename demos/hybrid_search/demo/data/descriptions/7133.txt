This was originally recorded by Snow Patrol .
It was included on their 2004 Final Straw album and its single release reached # 5 in the UK .
Snow Patrol singer and chief songwriter Gary Lightbody said of Lewis ' version in the Daily Record : `` She obviously studied the song and thought long and hard about how to interpret it .
She 's stripped it to its bare core .
I think she sounds absolutely phenomenal . ''
Lewis originally sung this song during a session recorded for BBC 1 's Live Lounge on October 31 , 2007 .
A year later she recorded a studio version for a deluxe edition of her Spirit album .
After an emotional interpretation by the singer on the X-Factor TV program provoked an ecstatic public reaction , there was a massive outcry for it to be issued as a single .
Lewis ' record company heeded the demands and it swiftly became the UK 's fastest ever selling digital-only release with 133,000 downloads in its first seven days .
