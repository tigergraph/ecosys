This is a re-working of a traditional folk song with new lyrics suggesting that President Bush is a warmonger who is possibly motivated by oil profits .
This blunt , political song generated a lot of controversy upon the release of Trouble No More .
Mellencamp told Mojo magazine December 2008 that he had to put up with a huge amount of abuse back home in Indiana .
He explained : `` People were driving past my house throwing s -- t and yelling and giving my wife Elaine the finger as she drove down the street .
I was driving to the airport one day with the boys -LRB- about four and eight then -RRB- and they played the song on the radio .
A listener calls and says , ' I do n't know who I hate the most , that John Mellencamp or Saddam Hussein . '
It really freaked the kids out and it pissed me off .
We had to get security to come around the school playground because the teachers thought people might harm them . ''
