This is a short but powerful song by Team Sleep , not released on an album but still a very popular song among TS fans .
The song seems to hinder on both an emotional tinge of loss and gain : `` When I waved to you , then you knew I was gone , you calmed down .
So , there in the air , where I ca n't move , I say , just say to you , goodbye my love , goodbye . ''
The song conveys utter sadness but relief - the singer seems to be speaking to someone , as if he 's saying he 's sad to leave but ca n't reach out to his love anymore .
She 's lost to him in a place where he ca n't reach , there is a feeling he cares so much but is stuck between loss and accepting that it has already happened .
