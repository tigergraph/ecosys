This is the closing track of Set You Free , the ninth studio album by Gary Allan .
The Country star sequenced the 12 tracks to take listeners on the journey of a relationship .
`` When I got the songs in the order I liked I realized what I had done was create a story line so that it played like a breakup , '' he explained to The Boot .
`` The first song is ` Tough Goodbye , ' and then I went through all the emotions of a breakup , all way to the healing song , ` Good as New . '
So the album covers the gamut of a breakup and the first stages of healing . ''
