The second single from Green Day 's ยก Uno !
album finds Billy Joe Armstrong proclaiming threateningly : `` Someone kill the DJ , shoot the fu -- ing DJ . ''
Before you dial 911 and accuse the Californian trio of advocating the murder of record spinners , consider that the lyrics are not as they seem . ''
` Kill the DJ ' is not about , you know , killing a DJ , '' Armstrong laughed to MTV News .
`` It 's not literal .
It 's more of a metaphor for information overload . ''
The song premiered on August 13 , 2012 during Zane Lowe 's BBC Radio 1 show .
The song contains over 20 expletives .
`` Oh , all the f-bombs are on there , '' Armstrong told The Sun .
`` Someone pointed that out to me the other day .
I did n't even realize as we 've always had that before .
Nimrod was like Tourettes !
We 'll have to see what happens .
I 'm sure there will be an edit like Kill The Goshdarn DJ . ''
This is close to a floor filler , something the Californian punksters have only briefly dabbled with in the past .
`` This song is sort of a left turn , kind of going into something more of a four-on-the-floor dance groove , '' Armstrong told MTV News . ''
-LSB- Bassist -RSB- Mike -LSB- Dirnt -RSB- was really like , ` Well , let 's do something that 's more like Blondie 's `` Heart Of Glass , '' kind of a disco feel to it . '
We 've always kind of got into grooves and things like that , with like ` When I Come Around ' and ` Brain Stew , ' but this is the first time we went full-on dancemusic , but with a Green Day approach to it . ''
