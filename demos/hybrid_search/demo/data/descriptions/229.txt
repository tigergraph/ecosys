Perri 's third promotional single from her debut album Lovestrong was released on April 26 , 2011 .
The track goes back a long way - in fact back to 2002 - and was the second song Perri had ever written .
She penned it with her older brother , Nick Perri , who has played guitar with Shinedown , Silvertide , Perry Farrell and Matt Sorum .
Perri said of her relationship with her brother to USA Today : `` We 're really close .
We look alike , we talk alike , we think alike .
We 're like the tattooed Carpenters . ''
