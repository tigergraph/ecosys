Glasvegas Frontman James Allan wrote this spoken word piece after a drug overdose forced him to pull out from the Coachella festival .
He told Mojo magazine : `` I started writing our second album when we were out in Los Angeles last year , we were supposed to be playing the Coachella festival , but did n't .
I was sitting in Charlie Chaplin 's old house , a friend was writing a film score in the next house , Depeche Mode were playing and I ended up writing the words to the album opener Pain , Pain Never Again . ''
The song is based on a piece of music by Paul Cantelon , who played `` Moonlight Sonata '' on the Glasvegas track `` Stabbed . ''
The song was not originally intended to be a spoken word piece .
Allan told the Sunday Mail : `` My initial thoughts were to get an opera singer to sing my lyrics but a friend from Montreal translated them into French-Canadian .
She recorded it and sent me the piece .
She is a lovely person and her voice is just perfect for it . ''
Allan told The Sun : `` For Pain Pain I was thinking of NASA and music to a space shuttle taking off for some reason , and the music keeps building and building . ''
