There is no official soundtrack to the Judd Apatow movie Knocked Up , which Loudon provided a number of songs for , but Strange Weirdos is described as `` Music from and inspired by the film Knocked Up '' and there 's a live version of this song featured as an `` Extra '' on the DVD to the movie .
Loudon appeared in the movie as Dr. Howard .
`` You Ca n't Fail Me Know '' was co-written and co-produced by Joe Henry -LRB- an acclaimed singer/producer who wrote `` Do n't Tell Me '' -RRB- and is featured on his album Civilians .
NPR music reviewer Allison L. Stewart compares Henry 's version to Loudon Wainwright 's : `` Formerly a slow , hookless strings-and-guitar ballad , it 's now more sparse , more morose -LRB- assuming that 's possible -RRB- and even lovelier .
`` Henry probably would n't agree , considering he is a huge Loudon Wainwright fan ; he even calls the singer a hero and a mentor .
After the two worked together on `` You Ca n't Fail Me Now '' and several other songs for the Knocked Up soundtrack , Henry could barely keep from gushing about the singer in an LAist interview : `` No he 's not just a regular guy .
I mean he 's a good friend , but I do n't hold him in any less high esteem .
I think he is one of the most underrated songwriters considering his influence . ''
This song describes a long-lasting relationship where the singer freely admits that he was not always comfortable with the idea of being in love , but his partner knows him better than he thinks : `` The stain of love 's a smudge upon my brow , but you see through me . ''
-LRB- thanks , Robert Campion - Galway , Ireland , for above 2 -RRB-
