This emotional number about an elderly man looking back at his life was written by Johnson as a tribute to his grandfather .
The country singer-songwriter explained to Roughstock : `` He died in 2000 ; I 've got memories of him .
He did n't know I was a songwriter or a singer .
He just knew I could sing and write and that I was moving Nashville to get it done .
He died probably the first 8 months that I was in town .
I 've always wanted to pay tribute back to thank him for the lessons growing up , all the conversations with him .
Nobody ever pays attention to that stuff until they 're gone I 'm afraid .
I had a long way to go , I wanted him to be around a lot longer , I was n't ready for him to go .
So it 's kind of appropriate way to introduce this album to the public . ''
This was named Song of the Year at the 2009 Academy of Country Music Awards .
In his acceptance speech , Johnson said : `` I thank these two guys up here - Lee Miller and James Otto - for helping me write this song .
Thanks to my band , too , for going in on an off day and producing an off record . ''
Later in the year , the song won the 2009 CMA Song of the Year Award .
