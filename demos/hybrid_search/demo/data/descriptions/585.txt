Martha Wainwright closes her third album , Come Home To Mama , with this heartbreaking track on which the singer pours her heart out to her baby son Arcangelo , warning him that as he grows up that he will find a world where parents cheat on each other , before passing away .
However , his mother 's love will remain unconditional .
`` That was the last song I wrote , and it came out through a lot of tears , '' Wainwright told Spinner .
`` I just want things to be easier for him .
Life is hard , and I want him to feel protected . ''
