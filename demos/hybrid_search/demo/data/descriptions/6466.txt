This song features Jay-Z and is a re-mix of a song that Jigga originally recorded for his 2007 American Gangster album .
Fabolous explained their collaboration to MTV News : `` Me and Jay built a connection through Def Jam .
Through working together executive to artist -LSB- when Jay was Def Jam president -RSB- , we built a different relationship as well .
Maybe artist to artist we was in a little different space .
You did n't know where each other was at .
We work well .
When I needed help with the -LSB- new -RSB- album and I was reaching out for people for joints for the album , he was one of the people that was like , ` Hear this . '
That 's where that joint came from .
We got a connection .
He 's from Brooklyn , I 'm from Brooklyn - that 's enough of a connection right there . ''
