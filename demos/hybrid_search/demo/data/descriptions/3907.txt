McCartney explained on his MySpace site that this track was inspired by a conversation he had with writer/producer Sean Garrett about `` moving on from your first true love . ''
It was before Jesse 's time , but John Lennon wrote a song called `` How Do You Sleep ? ''
about a different McCartney : his Beatles bandmate Paul .
Ludacris also appears in the song 's promo .
The rapper told MTV News : `` You have the Ludacris element , with me car-surfing on the hood on one of these old-school cars .
And I said , ` As long as you have one of those old-school cars and big-ass chains in a video , I 'm down . '
What else do you want in a video ? ''
Along with this track , Garrett also produced `` Rock You '' and `` Into Ya '' on the album .
Other songs he 's worked on include `` Yeah ! ''
by Usher , `` Run It ! ''
by Chris Brown `` Goodies '' by Ciara and `` London Bridge '' by Fergie .
The single release of this song was a re-mix featuring the rapper Ludacris .
McCartney commented in a press release : `` I 've been a fan of Luda 's throughout his career and having him on this track was an amazing honor .
He 's innovative across the board and always brings the freshest lyrics to any track . ''
In the video , a photograph of singer Katy Perry can be seen attached to the car sun visor .
