Guitarist Marc Stewart -LRB- from Alternative Press magazine -RRB- : `` This song is about not listening to everyone around you and just realizing it 's about you and not what other people think you should be .
We wrote it during a time in our lives when everyone was trying to push us in different ways . ''
