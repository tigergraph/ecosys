This is the title track of the sixth album by American indie rock band Plain White T 's .
The collection of the songs is intended to evoke the feeling of awe and the yearning for adventure remembered from youth .
Higgenson told Alternative Press magazine : `` Once I played this song for the band , they understood my crazy concept for this album .
The album is all about looking back on the good old days -- when life was simple .
The days before we had responsibility .
The days when we lived in the moment .
The days of our youth .
My big idea is that maybe with some good music to inspire us and the use of our own imaginations , we can recapture a bit of that wonder .
Maybe , just maybe , even if only for a moment , we can all be young again . ''
Frontman Tom Higgenson explained in an interview with the Chicago Tribune the original inspiration for the album 's concept .
`` We were in Vegas last year around Valentine 's Day and saw the Cirque du Soleil show ` O. ' The show had clowns , pirates and a bunch of crazy stuff and I walked out thinking ` I 've got a great idea for our next album . '
From that point on , my mind went wild . ''
