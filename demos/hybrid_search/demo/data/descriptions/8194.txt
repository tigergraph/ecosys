This was the first UK Top 20 hit for London-based Grime music collective Roll Deep .
The song is based around the chorus and melody of `` Heartache Avenue , '' which reached # 7 in the UK singles chart for the Maisonettes in 1982 .
Band member Wiley first heard `` Heartache Avenue '' on the radio in a taxi cab on the radio and was blown away by the track .
As soon as he got back to their studio in London he began looking up the tune with the view of sampling it and took the idea to the rest of the crew .
