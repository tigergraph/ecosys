Asking Alexandria singer and songwriter Danny Worsnip was in a dark place during the recording of Reckless & Relentless .
Depressed and miserable about everything , he turned to drugs and alcohol as a cover up to try to disguise it and hide how unhappy he was .
This song finds him reflecting what he was doing to himself .
He explained to Artist Direct : `` I 'm almost admitting everything I was feeling and going through and accepting nothing was going to change .
That 's how things were , and I 'd have to deal with it . ''
