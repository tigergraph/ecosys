The video clip to this song was directed by German director Wim Wenders in an abandoned prison in Berlin .
Wenders , who 's an avid fan of Eels ' music , also directed music documentaries like `` Buena Vista Social Club '' about Cuban musicians -LRB- check the Songfacts for `` Chan Chan '' -RRB- and The Soul of Man about Blues Musicians .
-LRB- thanks , Martin - Rostock , Germany -RRB- The cover of the Souljacker album featured Eels mainman Mark Everett hooded and with a thick beard making him look like a terrorist .
Consequently after the events of 9/11 the album 's American release was delayed until March 2002 .
The worst irony of the album 's cover and title however was that one of Everett 's cousins , Jennifer , was a stewardess on board America Airlines Flight 77 , the plane that flew into the Pentagon killing everyone on board .
