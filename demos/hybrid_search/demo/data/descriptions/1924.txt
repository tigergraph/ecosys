On this cover of a song by Canadian alternative country singer-songwriter Fred Eaglesmith , Lambert continues to live up to her image of a crazy gun-toting firecracker .
She said : `` I 've known that song for a while .
And it 's not at secret that I like guns , and that I am a redneck girl .
That song is so fitting for the times , and it 's political -- but not really .
I do n't ever want to use my platform for politics .
We all come together through music , so it 's best to leave those opinions at home .
` Time to Get a Gun ' to me is just a cool , straight ahead song -- and it 's also fun .
He 's talking about partying , and maybe he 'd be able to afford his gun if he did n't drink as much .
I was just insistent on cutting it .
It really sounds like me and sounds like my life . ''
