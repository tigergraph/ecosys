This song is about a guy and a girl who decide to take their relationship to the next level , but when it comes down to it the guy is n't sure that he 's ready , and thinks they should just hold each other instead .
In the end , he relents to her wishes and does it .

Many bands choose to give some of their songs and albums foreign names .
One example would be from AFI - `` Miseria Cantare '' - Latin for `` sing the sorrow . ''
Also , The Police album titles Regatta de Blanc and Outlandos D'Amour .
-LRB- thanks , Kaity - Harrisburg , PA -RRB- `` Sic Transit Gloria '' is Latin for `` Glory Fades . ''
During the Roman Empire , when a general returned to Rome after a successful campaign , he would be welcomed with a huge parade ; he would then show off all the foreign treasure he had captured , as well as slaves and exotic animals .
He would ride in a chariot leading the way .
He would be greeted with tens of thousands of Roman citizens praising him , and showering him with gifts .
The emperors , who resided in Rome , usually became afraid that the General would attempt a coup , so he would have one of his servants ride in the Chariot with the general and whisper in his ear throughout the ceremony , `` Sic Transit Gloria '' -LRB- Glory fades , or all glory is fleeting -RRB- to remind the general that his popularity would not last , so he should n't become arrogant over his success .
