The meaning behind this song has caused a bit of confusion over the years .
With its politically charged video that alternates the breakdown of a right wing spy with flashes of Rush Limbaugh 's face on a TV screen , most fans assume the song was aimed at the conservative radio host .
The lyrics even seem to accuse Limbaugh and his contemporaries of a fear-mongering agenda : `` You try to tell the world how it should spin , But you live in terror with the hollow men , Who stun you with their lies , With fever in their eyes as they drown you . ''
But , according to Phillips , the possibility of a political interpretation is just that - a possibility .
She said in our interview : `` It 's not specifically about Rush Limbaugh , but it might be about what 's wrong with Rush Limbaugh .
But that might also be what 's wrong with somebody else who 's liberal .
I try to make them a little bit more human than specific in that sense , so that ` Baby I Ca n't Please You ' is a broader concept .
It could be in a love relationship .
It could be in a political relationship .
Hopefully there are many levels you can take any of my songs on .
That is always my aim . ''
This song was used in the 1999 TV movie It Came From the Sky -LRB- starring Christopher Lloyd , John Ritter and Jo Beth Williams -RRB- and also appeared on the Melrose Place : The Music soundtrack in 1994 .
The music video for this song ends with a quote by Christian author C.S. Lewis : `` People in fear are always attempting to gain power ... People in love are always willing to give up power . ''
