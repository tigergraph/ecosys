Lead singer Jason Wade : `` This is my favorite song on the record .
We were working on `` Spin , '' and I just went in the other room and wrote it .
Ron -LRB- their producer -RRB- heard me playing it and said `` Let 's record it . ''
We recorded it right after I wrote it .
The band had never even heard the song we just rolled tape and it clicked .
It was the coolest thing .
I 'd like to do a whole record that way because what came out was so pure .
We had no idea how it was going to turn out .
It instantly took on a life of its own , which was amazing . ''
-LRB- thanks , Patti - Mahopac , NY -RRB-
