Drenge is an English two-piece Post Grunge duo comprising frontman Eoin Loveless and his younger brother Rory , on drums .
The band rose to prominence following the resignation of Labour MP Tom Watson from the Shadow Cabinet in July 2013 .
Included in his resignation letter was a surreal reference to Drenge , in which he called them `` an awesome band . ''
Originally this feral blues explosion finished at the one and a half minute mark .
However , according to Eoin Loveless , the pair `` were jamming around one day and put on the final instrumental wig-out . ''
Drenge took their name from the Danish word for `` boys , '' although it is pronounced differently .
The Loveless brothers told Far Out Magazine that they chose their name because , `` It sounded really ugly and vicious , and a good way to describe these riffs we 'd been kicking about . ''
The song soundtracked an advert for the TV series Misfits and also featured in the BBC school-set drama Waterloo Road .
Regarding the latter , Eoin Loveless told NME : `` We were playing a gig in Bath and I got texts from friends and my mum saying , ` You 've just been played on Waterloo Road . '
I decided to see what the context of the scene was and it was just a teacher setting up a chemistry lesson -- it was n't a school fight or a car crash . ''
