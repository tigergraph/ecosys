In December 2009 , Sting was the subject of an hour long BBC TV documentary which was dedicated to his Winter Song project .
In this he explained the background to this song .
It was he said , a begging song , a very old English song which originated in the ritual of baking soul cakes .
These were made to feed the dead on Halloween - in the hope that it would sate their hunger until the following year .
As , obviously , the dead did not generally have much of an appetite , the poor and hungry got the idea that they could beg for them.Check out an example of a Soul Cake .
A radio edit of the Sting version was produced `` Not For Sale - For Promotion Only '' , and this will undoubtedly become a collectors ' piece in the decades to come .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for all above -RRB- `` Soul Cakes '' appears to emanate from Cheshire , and was published in the 1893 study English County Songs by Lucy Etheldred Broadwood and J. A. Fuller Maitland wherein it is alluded to as `` Souling Song -LRB- Cheshire -RRB- '' ; it is also known simply as `` Souling Song '' or the `` Cheshire Souling Song '' , and is written in 6/8 time .
According to Miss Broadwood 's notes , the words and music were taken down by the Reverend M.P. Holme at Tattenhall , Cheshire .
Part of it was restored from the book Shropshire Folk-Lore by Charlotte Burne , and the rest of the song was sung by a young girl at Tattenhall School in October 1891 .
