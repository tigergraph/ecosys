The line , `` Well tonight thank god it 's him instead of me '' is directed at Bono , the lead singer of U2 .
In the 1984 , Band Aid song `` Do They Know It 's Christmas ?
, '' Bono sang the infamous line , `` Well tonight thank god it 's them instead of you . ''
At the time One Way Ticket To Hell And Back was being recorded , lead singer Justin Hawkins and Bono quarreled after Bono gave Hawkins permission to sing his line in the remake of ` Do They Know It 's Christmas '' because Hawkins said Bono 's voice was shaky after hearing him re-sing the line .
Bono got upset and maintained that Hawkins stole the line from him and they have clashed ever since .
Hawkins thought it would be funny to manipulate Bono 's infamous line to deride him in song or possibly even write an entire song about his impending hair loss .
