Josh Groban penned this Latin flexed song with longtime collaborator Tawgs Salter and Canadian singer-songwriter Simon Wilcox .
The lyrics and melody were formed on the day Groban participated in Life Below the Line , a campaign in which people subsist on $ 1.50 for a day in order to understand the levels of true poverty .
`` It was not fun , '' said the singer .
`` A can of beans was my food , half in the morning and half at night .
Somehow a song came out of it .
It 's not necessarily the full message of the song .
The vibe is , ` We 're not helping ourselves until we 're helping others . ' ''
Groban told Billboard magazine : `` I rarely throw political messages and things like that into songs , but this is a song I felt was inspiring on the day and continues to be . ''
