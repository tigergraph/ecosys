This song is about fighting against an inevitable fall - a fall which is ultimately brought on by outside pressure , as reflected in the lyric : `` Because everyone would rather watch you fall -LRB- we 're all in trouble -RRB- . ''
The official video for `` Spotlight '' was directed by Brandon Goodwin and features Mutemath performing the track in the back of a moving vehicle in time lapse effect .
There is an alternative video which Darren King admitted to us he hates : `` There was this really frustrating experience : there was this director out of New York who did this video for ` Spotlight , ' and he had drawn up all these ideas and drawings .
The idea was that we were going to be playing machines that were going to be playing the music .
And they were going to sort of take over -- it was this really exciting idea .
And we got there and we filmed it .
And the end product was just crap .
It was so awkward and it was a bad video . ''
King added the director leaked the video without Mutemath 's permission : `` That 's completely not cool .
He definitely had no right to do that .
So out there there 's this version of ` Spotlight ' that I ca n't stand . ''
For the record - you can watch the alternative video on YouTube .
`` Spotlight '' features on the Twilight soundtrack .
In our interview with Mutemath drummer Darren King , he admitted featuring in Twilight helped Mutemath and their album , Armistice , to garner a new wave of fans : `` In retrospect , I think that that could have saved us in regards to that album .
Because that song was not a hit at radio .
And I think it getting on that soundtrack gave that album enough of a life that we were able to get opportunities to play on Leno , to play Letterman again , to get to tour and reach a new audience , a younger audience , and I 'm thankful for that now . ''
