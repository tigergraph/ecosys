Urban wrote this in 2006 and it was one of two new tracks on his Greatest Hits package .
The Country star explained to AOL how this self-penned song was inspired by his marriage to Nicole Kidman : `` It 's interesting , because the song 's hook is , ' I think I got it right this time . '
And I 'm certainly at a point now where there 's no thinking involved !
-LSB- laughs -RSB- There 's a little more conviction than that .
And I had that full conviction when I wrote it , but as a songwriter , there are choices made with words because they sing well .
So , ' I know I got it right this time ' just does n't sing as well as ' I think I got it right this time . '
But as the song has evolved and grown , our marriage has evolved a lot .
So -LSB- on the new recording -RSB- , at the very end there 's an ad-libbed line that says , ' I mean , I know I do . '
-LSB- laughs -RSB- Songs are interesting , because they 're written at a certain time in a writer 's life and they mean a certain thing , but often , the really magical ones develop deeper meaning .
And this song has definitely grown to have a deeper meaning for me . ''
