Fleet Foxes frontman Robin Pecknold revealed to UK music magazine the NME that nicotine patches , which he wore during the writing and recording of Helplessness Blues led to the creation of this song .
Asked by the UK music magazine whether it 's based on a dream Pecknold replied , `` Yeah .
I was trying to quit smoking while I was doing the record and if you use a nicotine patch it can give you really insane dreams , really vivid and real .
It kinda got to the point where I 'd put a nicotine patch on before going to bed to see what would happen .
You 'd have these really crazy experiences in your dreams .
It was fun . ''
