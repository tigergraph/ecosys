The English singer-songwriter Anna Calvi was exposed to many different genres of music by her melomaniac Italian father .
She cites the classical composers Ravel and Debussy among her influences and aims to condense the grand ebb and flow of classical compositions into dark , romantic , atmospheric pop songs .
She explained to the NME : `` In classical music you 've got accessible melodies but they 're taken to extremes , whereas in pop it 's in bite-sized form .
I 'm stretching it out and seeing if you can apply the tension and release of classical music into pop .
On ` The Devil ' there 's this guitar part that 's like the strings in a Hitchcock film .
It gets more and more intense until there 's the explosion , as if the whole orchestra has come in . ''
The NME asked Calvi if the warnings of the Big Man arriving in this song belie a sense of exultancy about the devil 's presence ?
She replied : `` Interesting you should say that .
It ends on a major chord as the devil comes , and it 's maybe telling you it 's not a bad thing .
The lyrics tell you one thing and the music tells you something else .
But when I talk about the devil it 's a metaphor for being out of control .
And that can feel amazing .
I think the biggest fears are internal , not what 's out there in the world . ''
