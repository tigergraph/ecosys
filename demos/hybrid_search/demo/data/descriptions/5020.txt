This song deals with a low professional period in which it looked like Sexsmith 's 2011 album Long Player Late Bloomer would n't get released .
`` This was written right after we were done on Late Bloomer , '' he explained to CBC Music .
`` We had so much rejection on the album initially , I could n't believe it .
Here I was working with Bob Rock , we 're getting calls from the States from record companies saying they wanted to hear it , but then when we start playing it for people they were all saying it was too commercial .
I had never heard that in my whole career .
All the enthusiasm I had for making it completely evaporated , and I went back into this funky mood and wrote ` Nowhere to Go , ' feeling like I could n't do anything right .
But at the same time I wanted it to be humorous , so I had a thing about being run over by a lawnmower , which is kind of how I was feeling .
I just felt better from writing and singing it and that just triggered the rest of the song . ''
