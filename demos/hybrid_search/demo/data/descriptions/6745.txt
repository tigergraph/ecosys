This rocker was conceived when the trio were in Berlin promoting their 2009 album Living Thing .
`` We were looking for a record store that John had heard about called Dig a Little Deeper , '' explained singer-guitarist Peter Moren to Spin magazine .
`` On the way we walked by this art exhibition called ` All Art Is Contemporary . ' ''
This inspired a line that became the song 's centerpiece lyric , and which Moren feels is a false promise : `` I always find that the answers to today 's riddles are in what happened yesterday , '' he countered .
Musically , Moren told Spin the song 's lead riff references Texas R&B group Archie Bell & the Drell 's hit `` Tighten Up . ''
Said Moren : `` We wanted to get a thin , spiky sound , so we recorded the drums in the kitchen and the guitar in the hallway ! ''
