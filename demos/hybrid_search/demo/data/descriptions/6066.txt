This song is about a girl who breaks up with a guys by telling him they should be `` Friends . ''
This is not what he wants to hear , and to his ears , and the resulting heartbreak makes him think of the word `` Friend '' as dirty and cruel - similar to many vulgar 4-letter words in the English language .
-LRB- thanks , Joe - Chicago , IL -RRB- The lyrics are a play on words , the four letter word they refer to is `` iend , '' and is the only part of the word that the singer hears , which sounds like `` end . ''
