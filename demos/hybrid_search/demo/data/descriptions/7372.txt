A number of reviewers have commented that the French horn-led orchestral breakdown on this song about not fitting in , is producer Trevor Horn 's finest moment on the album .
Horn told The London Times September 26 , 2009 how he approached helming Reality Killed the Video Star : `` Robbie 's songs are anything but formulaic , so I needed to be creative , '' he said .
`` Robbie would always tell me if he did n't like something I did .
But all of what I do is designed only to make the singer sound good .
With too many records these days the production comes first , so they sound like they come out of a tin . ''
