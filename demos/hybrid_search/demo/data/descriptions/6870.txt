Jessie Ware wrote this ballad with the Bristol house producer Matt Walker , AKA Julio Bashmore .
She told The Sun : `` We wrote it really late at night last August and it is one of my favourite songs .
It 's more light-hearted than a lot of the album .
It 's so much fun to play live .
It 's also part one to a story , ` Running ' is part two . ''
Interest in the song 's music video increased after Odd Future frontman Tyler , The Creator tweeted a link to it with the message : `` Damn This Song Is So Sickkkkkkk .
The Sweet Talk Song That Is . ''
