Neil Peart -LRB- `` Roll The Bones Radio Special '' -RRB- : `` The Big Wheel is a good example on this album ; where it seems to be autobiographical , but it 's really not .
It 's where I 've looked for a universal of that tradeoff between innocence and experience , and that song certainly addresses that .
Not in the circumstances of my own life so much , or if it is , it 's not important that it be autobiographical , that 's just by the by really .
Very much I want to find universal things that others can relate to , and that 's a thing that 's part of everyone 's life , so I think that 's probably one reason why I 'm drawn to it .
And then so much of it is drawn from observing people around me too , so that becomes a factor in it too ; how they responded to life , and how they take to it .
How they adapt to that innocence and experience thing . ''
