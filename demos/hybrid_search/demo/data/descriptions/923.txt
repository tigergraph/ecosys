This is a track from The Illusion of Safety , the second album released by Anglo/Swede indie pop band The Hoosiers .
Frontman Irwin Sparkes explained to Digital Spy why this is his favorite song on the record : `` We recorded the album using our laptops while traveling round the world , and because we did n't have a lot of instruments we ended up improvising .
This song in particular features the sound of me banging a drawer in a hotel room in Osaka .
Somehow the noise made it on to the final album and it brings back a lot of good memories . ''
