Mark Oliver Everett sings on this song , `` Do n't mess with me , I 'm up for the fight . ''
He explained to The Sun : `` I do n't think I was fully aware of it at the time , but when I look back on it now , I can see there are a lot of lyrics on the new album about being painted into a corner and trying to fight your way out of it .
I think that 's because I did n't have a plan for the album and was scared I would n't find my way .
So that fight became the story of the album . ''
