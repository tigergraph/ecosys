`` I Ca n't Go For That -LRB- No Can Do -RRB- '' was a phrase Daryl Hall used when he was pressured to go along with the crowd against his wishes .
After a recording session for the Private Eyes album in Electric Lady Studios -LRB- New York City -RRB- , Hall , Oates and engineer Neil Kernon improvised this song .
In an interview with Mix Magazine , Daryl Hall recalls : `` Remember the old Roland CompuRhythm box ?
I turned to the Rock and Roll 1 preset , sat down at a Korg organ that happened to be lying there and started to play this bass line that was coming to me .
It 's the old recording studio story : The engineer heard what I was doing and turned on the tape machine .
Good thing , because I 'm the kind of person who will come up with an idea and forget it .
The chords came together in about 10 minutes , and then I heard a guitar riff , which I asked John , who was sitting in the booth , to play .
`` John Oates continues in the same interview : `` Daryl came up with this great bass line , using whatever sound happened to be on the organ , and Neil miked it and the drum machine .
Daryl came up with the ` B ' section chords , and then I plugged my 1958 Strat directly into the board , which was either an early SSL or a Trident .
`` The next day Hall and his girlfriend Sara Allen wrote the lyrics .
Hall recalls : `` I wrote most of the lyrics , but Sara contributed some ideas .
I sang the lead vocal , and there 's the song - ca n't get any simpler than that ! ''
John Oates -LRB- from an interview with Livedaily : '' ' I Ca n't Go for That ' is one of the most sampled songs from our catalogue , maybe ever for all we know .
It 's been sampled on so many songs .
I can name 5 or 6 versions of it .
Just last year Simply Red did a song called ` Sunrise , ' which was basically ' I Ca n't Go for That . '
The entire song .
It was n't a sample , it was the actual track .
He just wrote a different verse over it .
Puff Daddy sampled it , De La Soul sampled it .
I like it -LSB- when our music is sampled -RSB- .
I like when people have a different take on what you do .
That 's quite a compliment .
`` Among the songs to sample it are De La Soul 's 1989 UK # 18 hit `` Say No Go '' which utilizes it for the vocal hook in the chorus .
Also Simply Red 's 2003 # 7 UK hit was built around `` I Ca n't Go For That -LRB- No Can Do -RRB- '' 's instrumentation .
Hall & Oates used a Roland CompuRhythm 78 drum machine on the `` Rock & Roll 1 '' preset for this track .
What was the first major Pop song to use a drum machine ?
We say it was Robin Gibb 's 1969 UK hit `` Saved by the Bell . ''
This was the song that knocked Olivia Newton-John 's `` Physical '' out of # 1 in America after a 10 week stay at the top spot .
Michael Jackson has confessed that this greatly influenced his hit song `` Billie Jean . ''
Daryl Hall recalls , `` Michael Jackson once said directly to me that he hoped I did n't mind that he copped that groove .
That 's okay ; it 's something we all do . ''
This bridged the gap between the black and white charts , which is a rare achievement for a white act .
It hit # 1 on the R&B charts as well as the US Pop charts .
When this song came out , a review in the British press insisted it was about bondage , to which Daryl Hall mockingly replied : `` The English ... everything has to do with sexual perversion !
The English press is great ... ''
