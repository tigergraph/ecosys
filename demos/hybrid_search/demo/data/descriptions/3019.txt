This is a track from American singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera 's fourth studio album , Bionic .
The song features a rap by Canadian-born electronic musician and performance artist , Peaches .
This song was co-written and produced by feminist electroclash band Le Tigre , who are fronted by the former singer of the seminal riot grrrl band Bikini Kill , Kathleen Hanna .
Aguilera hooked up with the hipster-approved act after hearing their track `` Deceptacon '' and asking her label to get in touch .
Hannah told Billboard magazine the collaboration might earn the pop princess some new fans : `` People have been super-supportive of us working with her , '' said Hanna .
`` A few years ago there was a rumor going around that we were working with Paris Hilton , and people were ready to kill us .
Obviously , Christina and Paris Hilton are totally different entities .
But people seem genuinely excited about this .
It 's like maybe it gives them permission to admit they like Christina . ''
