This subdued , menacing track finds Earl Sweatshirt spitting some dark rhymes alongside fellow West Coast upstart Casey Veggies whilst early Odd Future member Vince Staples guests on the hook .
Earl supplied the song 's beat with Matt Martians .
He credits Christian Rich , who helmed several of the Doris tracks , for showing him the production ropes .
`` When he came back from Samoa he was messing around on Logic , so -LSB- we -RSB- gave him some sounds and just showed him how to quantize it , '' Taiwo `` Christian '' Hassan of the production duo explained to MTV News .
`` I did n't realize that we were teaching him how to make beats .
I did n't even know he was trying to be a producer , and then before we even got in the studio he already did ` Hive . ' ''
