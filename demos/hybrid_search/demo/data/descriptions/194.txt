Apparently , this Phil Lynott solo composition was first recorded way back in 1978 and played once by Thin Lizzy , at the 1983 Reading Festival .
Aficionados will appreciate that it is not really a Thin Lizzy song , which is why it was obviously never part of their set .
In 1983 , Phil played a solo tour of Sweden with Lizzy drummer Brian Downey , and this was recorded in Avesta on August 6 .
It was not released until 2001 .
Running to 6 minutes 25 seconds and featuring some blistering blues guitar from John Sykes , it is difficult to credit that it was written 5 years previously , as like `` Sugar Blues '' it is , or appears to be startlingly autobiographical and indeed prophetic , as less than three years later , Phil was indeed a prematurely aged blues singer dead at 36 .
