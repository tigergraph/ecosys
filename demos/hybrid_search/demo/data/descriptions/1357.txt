This song was written for the soundtrack of the movie Out Cold .
The song is about a guy whose girlfriend left him .
In the song he takes a drive to forget her , but he informs the girl that if she wants to come back she can .
Eve 6 played this at their reunion concert on October 20 , 2007 at the University of Mary Washington in Fredricksburg , Virginia .
It was one of the very few times the song was performed live .
