Like her previous album , The Fall , which was inspired by Jones ' break up with long-term musician boyfriend Lee Alexander , Little Broken Hearts , is also based on a failed relationship .
This song finds her singing of mutual infidelity .
`` I took my feelings and wrote about them , '' she told The Daily Mail .
Whether the breakup was traumatic or not is nobody 's business . ''
The breakthrough for this song was when Jones and Danger Mouse came up with the title .
Jones explained to Spinner : `` We came up with that line , and I remember thinking , ` Oh yeah , of course ! '
It 's like when you 're writing , you 're always chasing , not a catchphrase , necessarily , but something that will draw the listener in or make them go , ` Oh ! '
So that was kind of the moment for that song . ''
