This laid-back number was released by Kanye West on September 3 , 2010 as the second song in his `` G.O.O.D. Friday '' series , in which the Chicago MC releases a new tune to kick off the weekend every Friday .
On this vulnerable number , West laments being loved and left .
Was n't there a song from the '60s with this title ?
Close .
That was `` Devil With A Blue Dress by Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels .
West explained in a tweet that he released the song at the end of summer for fans to ride out the end of the season to the song 's leisurely feel .
`` There 's only 18 days of summer left , '' the 33-year-old tweeted .
`` I had to drop DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS while it was still hot out so people could role -LSB- sic -RSB- down there windows . ''
The version of this song that appears on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy features rapper Rick Ross .
The Miami MC explained to MTV News that he gave West his verse shortly before West turned in the completed album .
`` I got a call , they wanted me to be a part of that record , '' Ross explained .
`` It was actually the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in , and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me .
So I just sat there , approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could .
When I laid the verse , 30 minutes later , I was extremely happy .
I sent it to him , and he was too .
I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year . ''
