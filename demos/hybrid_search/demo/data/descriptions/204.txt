Britney Spears hitmaker Jim Beanz is the song 's writer and he came up with the unusual title after Cheryl expressed a desire to refrain from using swear words .
The singer explained to Pop Justice : `` I was trying to say , ` sexy than . '
The song is actually called `` Sexy -LSB- as in sexier -RSB- Than A Motherf -- er '' .
But we obviously censored the track .
I told him to call it ` The Sexy Song ' but it 's his song so I respected that . ''
Speaking with Digital Spy , Jim Beanz explained that he created the song especially for Cole .
`` I definitely had performance-based songs for her , '' he said .
`` I had tracks which I felt were really tailored to who I felt she was as a person and the artist she wanted to put out there to the public .
I 've always tried to make songs that fit an artist ; that they can perform in shows and that the public will gravitate towards.I gave her ` Sexy Den a Mutha , ' '' he continued , `` because I wanted it to be a statement .
It 's almost a female empowerment version of ` Sexy and I Know It ' by LMFAO . ''
Cole 's decision to censor the original title was because of her young fan base .
`` It was completely up to me whether I wanted to leave them on and I 'm old enough and ugly enough to say ` f -- ing hell ' if I want to , '' she told Pop Justice .
`` But I have a lot of younger fans too .
I thought it would be nice for them to hear the songs without the swear words .
Some parents freak out when you put a ` censored ' label on a CD .
Some of them are 12 , 13 !
They 've been waiting over a year for an album and I did n't want to push them out .
Adults get the message , I think . ''
