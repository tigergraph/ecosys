This is a track from On A Mission , the debut album by British R&B and dubstep singer-songwriter Katy Brien , who records under the name of Katy B .
She told Digital Spy about the cut : `` I like that song because it incorporates a lot of different sounds from the UK underground scene .
It 's not really a specific genre - it has a kind of ` rave ' vibe , but at the same time has this song over the top of it where the lyrics tell a story and really mean something to me . ''
