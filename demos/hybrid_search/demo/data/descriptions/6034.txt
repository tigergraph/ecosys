This is the first single to be released from Screamworks : Love in Theory and Practice , the seventh studio album by Finnish rock band HIM .
It was released on December 8 , 2009 , two months ahead of the LP .
The album title was inspired by one of Valo 's relationships that has since ended .
He told Kerrang !
magazine November 28 , 2009 : `` It 's a sonic diary of that -LRB- affair -RRB- .
The album 's also about both the theoretical and practical aspects of relationships which are an impossible problem to resolve .
` Screamworks ' represents a cathartic , primal scream ; it 's a big middle finger ; it 's a f -- k off , I want to do what I want to do . ''
The song begins with an intro that sounds like it was put together on a Casio keyboard .
Frontman Ville Valo explained to Billboard magazine that among the influences on `` Screamworks '' were '80s synth pop artists such as Duran Duran , Kraftwerk , and a-ha .
`` In the past we used synthesizers to emulate real instruments - piano and strings and all that , '' he noted .
`` This time we wanted all the synths to sound like synths .
It 's a pretty '80s album for us , but I grew up in the '80s and I love the '80s because the '80s , musically , was about melody and huge choruses .
That 's very essential for me . ''
