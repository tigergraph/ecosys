This song is about someone who is always doing the right thing to keep up their reputation and the satisfaction of defying everyone by doing something wrong and keeping it a secret for yourself , hence the lines , `` Molly was a good girl and she knew the reasons why , so when she went back in the bathroom she would never come outside , she was a good girl and it felt great to be a liar . ''
