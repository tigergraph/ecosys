`` High Wide & Handsome '' is the title song from Loudon Wainwright III 's twelfth studio album High Wide & Handsome : The Charlie Poole Project , which won a Grammy award for Best Traditional Folk Album .
Poole was a banjo picker and lead singer for the North Carolina Ramblers , known throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s for classic covers like `` Sweet Sunny South , '' `` White House Blues , '' `` He Rambled '' and `` Take a Drink on Me . ''
Wainwright pays homage to Poole by covering many of his songs , but he sneaks a few originals on the album , including `` High Wide & Handsome , '' a testament to Poole 's fast-living , hard-drinking and generally hell-raising life : Ca n't quit what will kill meSo why even bother?I love this hard living .
So why even try?I 'll be high , wide and handsome when I kick the bucketI 'll be high , wide and handsome on the day I dieWhat he could n't quit did indeed kill him .
Poole was just 39 when he died on May 21 , 1931 after a 13-week alcohol binge ended in heart failure .
But his legacy lives on through other singers like Wainwright .
`` I had such a strong identification with the rambling , hard drinking , crazy southern showman , '' Wainwright remembers .
As an up-and-comer in the '70s , he even dreamed of writing a film about Poole 's life and starring as the legend , but , some 40 years later , he offered High Wide & Handsome : The Charlie Poole Project , making a `` sonic bio-pic of sorts . ''
