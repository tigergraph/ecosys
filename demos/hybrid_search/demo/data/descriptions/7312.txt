This song finds Brandon Flowers singing of a relationship that 's about to crumble .
Flowers told the Spotify streaming site : `` You 've bussed enough tables to take out your girlfriend and do n't have a care and the world ... but there 's impending doom around the corner ! ''
Drummer Ronnie Vannucci told Spotify that the song finds The Killers returning to their roots .
He said : `` You know when archaeologists do these digs and uncover artifacts like bowls and sabre tooth tiger teeth and jawbones ? '
A Matter Of Time ' is us doing that , digging into our history , going back to my garage .
We still have that DNA in us and it was cool to find that without looking for it , it gives credit and validity to what we were doing in a hot garage ten years ago and we 're still driven by that . ''
