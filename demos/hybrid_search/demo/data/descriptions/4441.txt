In Greek mythology Hercules was the son of Zeus and Alcmena .
A hero of superhuman physical strength , he is represented as brawny , muscular and short-necked .
While serving Eurystheus , king of Argos , he performed 12 labours including the slaying of the Nemean lion and taking captive the Cretan bull .
