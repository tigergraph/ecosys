Lzzy Hale explained the song 's meaning to Artist Direct : `` For me , it 's about somebody special in my life , '' she said .
`` I 'm extremely lucky to be surrounded by people who love me and take me for who I am - as well as all of the weird stuff that comes with me -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
I love that line , ` You let me fall apart without letting go . ' .
The people who surround me have let me do that .
They let me make my mistakes , but they do n't let go .
It 's a realistic look at love and what real love means to me . ''
The song is the only piano ballad on The Strange Case Of ... Lzzy told Artist Direct : `` Putting piano on this record took me back to the beginning of Halestorm where piano was my primary instrument for the first few years of the band .
There 's an emotional thing that happens every time I perform that .
It 's very close to my heart . ''
