Canadian Christian rockers Thousand Foot Krutch open their sixth studio album , The End Is Where We Begin with a spoken introduction by frontman/songwriter Trevor McNevan .
He explained to NewReleaseTuesday : `` The title of the record , despite its personal meanings , had this epic , almost sci-fi ring to it , which got me thinking it might be cool if there was a ` mainframe ' type character that would open the album with an introduction and set the pace .
I wanted to find a voice that was somewhere between Optimus Prime -LRB- Transformers -RRB- and Hal from 2001 : A Space Odyssey , so -LRB- co-producer -RRB- Aaron Sprinkle and I sat there forever trying to recreate that .
In the end , we just ended up using my voice and effecting it like crazy . ''
