Moore wrote this song with Jamie Paulin and songwriter-producer Jeremy Stover .
He recalled to Great American Country : `` Jeremy , Jamie Paulin and I got together and Jamie grew up in Washington and Jeremy in Georgia .
We all grew up on a farm and grew up in places where obviously our dads were our heroes .
Both of my grandpas were Superman .
I could n't imagine them ever not being around .
I 'm very proud of that song . ''
Moore told Great American Country that this is the favorite song that he 's ever written .
He explained : `` I could have a 30-year career or be gone tomorrow , but nobody will ever be able to take that away from me , to be able to do that .
I lost my grandma and an uncle a couple of years ago and I was at home playing this song acoustic after I 'd written it .
My wife walked in and I was bawling and I said , ' I think I wrote this about my grandpas , but I think I also wrote it about my grandma and uncle . ' ''
Moore recalled to Great American Country his grandpas response to hearing this song : `` I sent a CD to both of them because they have no idea how to download a MP3 .
It was really the only time I 've ever heard or seen my grandpas cry besides my grandma 's funeral . ''
Though autobiographical , there is one line where narrative structure got in the way of the truth .
Moore admitted : `` The first line is , ` You stood on that bank where I got baptized/Gave me a 30-30 when I turned nine . '
Actually it was eight , but nine rhymed .
I 've sat up in a deer stand with my grandpa since I was three years old . ''
We are sure listeners will forgive Moore for the fabrication !
