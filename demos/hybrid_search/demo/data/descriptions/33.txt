This features Akon , who originated this track .
Nelly told The Sun September 12 , 2008 that getting the Sengalese rapper on board was tricky .
He explained : `` He 's busy .
He has his own record coming soon but then he played the track , cranked it up , and two days later called me and said , ` You got me .
I 'm in . ' ''
A different version was also released on Ashanti 's album The Declaration , where the R&B singer has two verses rather than the single one on this recording .
On both versions Akon sings the chorus .
Nelly recalled to XXL magazine how he changed his mind about this song : '' -LSB- Akon -RSB- sent it to me and it did n't hit me like right away .
I burned the CD and I took it home in the car and my system I do n't know but for some reason my system in my car is where I like to judge my music or something .
Because I get a better feel even though it 's louder in the studio or some s -- t .
But once I got in the car on my way home that s -- t got the knocking I called that muthaf -- ka right back like , ` Yo , you in line , cuz ! '
We did the joint and then I thought it would be hot to do it in kind of a collaboration or so to speak with Ashanti and she came -LSB- laughs -RSB- . ''
This also features Ashanti and the song plays on Nelly 's past relationship with the R&B singer .
Akon originally wrote this in 2006 for Lil ' Fizz , a former member of the boy band B2K .
Once it was decided that Lil ' Fizz would not be releasing an album , Akon took the song back and gave it to Nelly and Ashanti to develop .
