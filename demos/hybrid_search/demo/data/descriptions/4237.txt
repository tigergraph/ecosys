Guitarist Troy McLawhorn told Spin magazine why he is especially fond of this track : `` It has a whole different feel without going too far away from what fans of the band would expect from us , while it opens the door for us to explore music that is more groove-based .
I love the way the verse is subdued and almost has a reggae feel , and then opens up into a massive chorus .
When we get to the bridge , it 's full on rock with a tinge of a metal .
If we tried to write it with those parameters in mind it never would have happened .
That 's why I love it ! ''
