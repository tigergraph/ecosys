With song titles like `` You Love Me , '' `` Standing in Front of You , '' `` You Ca n't Win , '' as well as this song , the frequency of the word `` you '' in Stronger 's track list can not be ignored .
Speaking to MTV News , Clarkson this does not mean they are directed at one particular person , who 's done her wrong .
`` They 're all different ` you 's , ' '' she explained .
`` There 's no common , like , it was n't like one , I did n't have a bad breakup or anything , it was n't like that .
No I just think life is about relationships , so I always write about all these different ones going on in my life and I do n't really have a filter .
So it 's usually very -LSB- straightforward -RSB- . ''
