This lament about a cold romance that has led to drastic measures is the first single from The Age of Adz , the ninth release by American singer-songwriter and musician Sufjan Stevens .
The album 's title -LRB- pronounced `` Age of Odds '' -RRB- is a reference to the apocalyptic art of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson -LRB- 1936-1997 -RRB- .
Robertson married Adele Brent in 1955 and they had eleven children .
Their marriage ended after 19 years when Adele left him for another man , taking their children with her .
The schism in his married life prompted Robertson to return to the art he had loved as a child .
Robertson created signs , calendars , drawings and portraits filled with misogynistic messages denouncing `` bad '' women , and ex-wife Adele in particular .
He believed that he was a victim of a global female conspiracy , that his ex-wife 's betrayal would be the cause of the cataclysmic destruction of humanity , and that his art was divinely sanctioned .
This song seems to describe Robertson , however Stevens could also be drawing a parallel to his own experience .
