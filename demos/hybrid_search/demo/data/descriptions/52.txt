The song was originally recorded by Jamaican reggae star Half Pint with the title of `` Winsome . ''
It was a big hit and his first # 1 in his home country .
Half Pint heard about the Stones covering his song from percussionist Sydney Wolfe who was at a studio in Holland when Keith Richards chose it .
Wolfe relayed the news to Half Pint about the re-titled rock version .
The Jamaican reggae star surmised in The Sunday Gleaner : `` He -LRB- Richards -RRB- used to spend a lot of time in Jamaica .
He probably was around when it was popular on the charts . ''
Half Pint added that he finds it , `` interesting still .
They did it in a slow tempo way .
That tempo was more like a ballad tempo , but you can hear the rock attitude .
They had rock with a pop feel '' .
He concluded that the song 's reggae origins were not forgotten and the Stones also `` did it in a way that you can realise it was a reggae song .
It was not far from reggae , but you could hear the difference . ''
`` Too Rude '' was considered for the album title .
Keith Richards sang on this with Reggae star Jimmy Cliff .
Cliff had a hit years later with `` I Can See Clearly Now . ''
