This depiction of shy love was released as the first single from Air 's 2004 album Talkie Walkie .
It achieved some chart success , reaching the Top 20 in Finland and the Top 100 in France , Germany and Italy .
Air 's Nicolas Godin told Radio.com : `` We 're not the kind of band to have very many hit songs , so when we do manage to create one , it 's a big deal for us . ''
The 7 '' and CD single releases include an alternate version of the song that features Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star on vocals .
Dunckel recalled : `` We 'd seen Mazzy Star play in France , and the experience was just so slow and beautiful .
We were quite moved by the show , and inspired to write the slowest Air song ever , so we wrote ` Cherry Blossom Girl ' with her in mind , and she was kind enough to sing it for us .
It did n't work for the album , since it ended up just being JB and I on the record , but that version is very special to me . ''
The song was sung by Air 's Jean-Beno√Æt Dunckel .
He recalled to Radio.com the input of producer Nigel Godrich , who is best known for his work with Radiohead .
`` I like to think of Nigel as the guardian of the mood on Talkie Walkie , '' said Dunckel .
`` Like on ` Cherry Blossom Girl , ' I wanted to redo some of the vocals .
So I went into the studio and recorded more vocals for it , but Nigel did n't like them .
He preferred the original take , even though there were some minor mistakes .
He really helped us maintain the spirit throughout the whole album . ''
