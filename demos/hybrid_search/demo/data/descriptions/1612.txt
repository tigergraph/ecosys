This song finds Adam Young teaming up with his friend Breanne Duren , who knew Young pre-Ocean Eyes fame .
The keyboardist/singer previously provided guest vocals on `` The Saltwater Room . ''
`` We do this kind of back and forth , '' Young told Spin magazine .
`` It 's a bit cheeky in a romantic kind of way .
I knew if I was going to go in that direction , I would put it into one song .
I did n't want to get too cheesy . ''
