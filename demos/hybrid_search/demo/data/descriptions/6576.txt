Rihanna finishes her seventh studio album , Unapologetic , with this bouncy Stargate produced track , which finds her aiming for positivity despite past heartbreaks .
`` When people listen to my new album I want them to walk away with a spirit of hope , '' she told Vogue .
`` A light spirit .
That 's the place I 'm in and I want them to see that and I want them to feel that . ''
The song was co-produced by English dance / hip hop singer and producer Labrinth .
Rihanna and the UK hitmaker worked on the track when she came to London earlier in 2012 to work on new material .
As well as collaborating with rapper Tinie Tempah on his UK top 3 hits `` Pass Out '' and `` Frisky , '' Labrinth has recorded several successful singles under his own name , including the chart-topping `` Beneath Your Beautiful '' .
Speaking with the Daily Record , Labrinth revealed that the Bajan Beauty was `` difficult '' to work with .
He said : `` I 've finished working with Rihanna on some of her album ... It was difficult but we got through it . ''
Pressed as to what was difficult about the experience , the British record producer replied enigmatically : `` It was just difficult . ''
