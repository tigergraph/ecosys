This song , which was inspired by The Jam and Aztec Camera , was written by frontman Kelly Jones after an argument with some city boys .
He explained to The Sun November 13 , 2009 : `` Me and some mates were in a pub and these boys came in who 'd had a bad week with the recession .
We got on the other end of a comical argument , which ended up on the pavement outside , which was one of the most surreal moments I 've had in my life .
It stemmed from nothing and I just loved the line ` upper-cut from the upper class . '
It 's a tongue in cheek thing . ''
