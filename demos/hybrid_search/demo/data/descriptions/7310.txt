This was inspired by a break-up that Charles Kelley of Lady Antebellum had just endured .
Lady Antebellum is a trio consisting of Charles Kelley -LRB- the brother of singer-songwriter Josh Kelley -RRB- , Dave Haywood and Hillary Scott -LRB- the daughter of '90s country star Linda Davis -RRB- .
Singer Hillary Scott explained their name to MP3.com : `` We got together as just songwriters .
Became friends and started writing songs .
And we wanted to put up a MySpace page .
So we wanted to take pictures to put on MySpace to get people 's attention , and we ended up going out outside of Nashville to this little town .
It 's this historic town called Franklin , Tennessee , and there 's tons of antebellum homes with the columns , like , from Gone With the Wind .
And we ended up in front of these houses , and Charles , the other lead singer in the group , he kind of looked back through the pictures and said , ` Wow , that 's a really beautiful antebellum home . '
And I said , ` What does that mean ? '
I did n't know what it meant .
But after he explained it to me , I was like , ` Oh , yeah .
It is .
It 's really pretty . '
And he goes , ` Is n't that a cool word ? '
And then we just put a bunch of words in front of it , and ` Lady ' is what stuck . ''
