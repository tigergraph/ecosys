The origins of American singer-songwriter Andrew Bird 's sixth solo studio album , Break It Yourself , were a casual recording session during August 2011 in his West Illinois barn with drummer/percussionist Martin Dosh and guitarist Jeremy Ylvisaker that went well .
`` It was about as low pressure a recording situation as I 've ever experienced , '' Bird told Billboard magazine of the sessions .
`` It was the band in the barn , just playing live to an 8-track tape .
That 's exactly what you hear .
There are no studio checks , no overdubbing .
The album is the sound of the room . ''
Bird told About.com the song , `` is about if it 's possible to break your own heart if you ca n't find anyone else to do it , just for the life experience . ''
This song was released as the first single from the album .
Said Bird to Paste Magazine regarding the song 's meaning : '' ` Tis noble to be strong and self-reliant , but if you 're too proficient who 's going to break your heart ?
Doing it yourself is as easy as seeing your own eyeball . ''
