Bowersox explained the story behind the song in an interview with Artist Direct : '' ` Arlene ' was the tour bus driver this summer on the American Idol tour .
When I could n't sleep , I spent many nights in the front of the cab and had some really good talks with her .
She was an inspirational , strong , independent woman and a role model to me .
She told me she 's been ` rock 'n' roll trucking ' for 30 years and no one 's ever written a song for her , so I did !
I 'm really happy it made it on the album .
Arlene made sure we got from point A to B and B to C , and she was there for counsel as well.It 's also the song that I feel is the closet to my roots musically .
My friend Ryan Suzuka played harmonica .
My bass player Frankie May who I 've played with since high school is on that track as well .
That song is very sentimental to me .
I think the statement in the song , ` If you want it done right , you 've got to do it yourself , ' is about being strong as a man or a woman .
It 's about living a simple life and loving it .
I even wrote the song on that tour around the beginning of August . ''
