The first official single from M.I.A. 's fourth studio album Matangi was written by the singer herself and was produced by Switch and Surkin .
It was released unveiled by Zane Lowe on his BBC Radio 1 show on June 17 , 2013 and released on digital retailers on following day .
Mathang was initially meant to be dropped in December 2012 , but M.I.A. 's label , Interscope , held it back on the basis that the record was `` too positive . ''
Interviewed by Australian site Gold Coast , M.I.A said : `` I thought I 'd finished it .
I finished it and then I handed the record in , like a couple of months ago .
At the moment , I 've been told it 's too positive .
So we 're having a bit of an issue at the label .
They 're like , ` You need to darken it up a bit ' . ''
She added : `` I do n't know what it is but as soon as I work that out ... I 'm taking my time to decide what they mean .
It 's an interesting one for me .
It 's like , ` We just built you up as the public enemy number one , and now you 're coming out with all this positive stuff . ' ''
M.I.A. explained to Zane Lowe that though the song was written more than a year previously , it was particularly pertinent concerning the current political climate and `` having to deal with the concept of freedom in more ways than one . ''
M.I.A tweeted in 2012 that the song 's line , `` truth is a like a rotten tooth , you got to spit it out , '' was one of her favorite lyrics from Matangi .
