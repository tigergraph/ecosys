This song is about a young boy who was stabbed to death on the street where Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones lives .
He recalls in The Sun newspaper October 12 , 2007 : `` It was something I saw looking out of my very own window .
I saw a row of 7 policeman searching an area of my street .
Then I read in the paper that they 'd been searching for a knife as this kid had been stabbed .
He had been involved in a bit of a scuffle and never made it home again .
For that to happen in my street , it affected me a lot .
I had just become a dad and having my daughter had changed everything .
It happens all the time these days .
It was n't something I had looked at in the paper and thought , ` Oh this is topical , let 's write about this . '
It was something I literally saw outside my front door . ''
