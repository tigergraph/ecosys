This ballad-like track was inspired by frontman Jacob Shaddix 's long relationship with his wife .
The singer explained to Billboard magazine : `` She was like , ` You always write songs about hard times ... Look at our life together .
We 've been through so much , and we 're still standing .
Why do n't you write a song about that ? '
So I did .
I 'm into commitment .
I 'm into the long haul - with my wife in particular , and my band .
That 's what that song is about .
I 'm definitely excited to see where our music goes now with this kind of new perspective on my life . ''
