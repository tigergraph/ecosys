The lyric , `` I 'll raise you like a phoenix , '' is a reference to the mythical bird of ancient times that burned itself to death on a pyre every 500 years and rose rejuvenated from the ashes .
The phoenix was subsequently adopted as a symbol of resurrection in early Christianity .
The song samples the 1941 classical work `` Allegro Non Troppo , '' which was composed by Dmitri Shostakovich .
Vocalist Patrick Stump told Kerrang !
magazine he was inspired by `` the creepiness '' of the strings and `` really wanted to build something around those . ''

Awards .
Kerrang !
asked Wentz who the `` You 're wearing our vintage misery .
No I think it looked a little better on me '' lyric is aimed at ?
He replied : `` I 'd gone through a pretty toxic time in my life a few years before , and I guess the song in general is inspired by the animal-in-a-trap quality of being ready to chew off your own leg rather than spending another second with someone . ''
The video sees each band member being taken hostage by a handful of female kidnappers , while frontman Patrick Stump is seen being tortured .
It serves as a prequel to the `` My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark -LRB- Light Em Up -RRB- '' clip , explaining how the band ended up blindfolded in the back of the black van .
Bassist Patrick Stump 's lyrics were inspired by a 1979 Matt Dillon movie Over the Edge , where kids take over a Californian town .
He told Kerrang !
: `` I wanted something of that period in the suburbs where you 're just a young buck and you 're into skateboarding and hanging out and nothing really seems to matter .
`` Lyrically , I 'm known for being quite verbose , '' he continued , `` and I do n't simplify very well , but Butch -LRB- Walker , producer -RRB- really encouraged me to .
The lyric , ` I 'm gon na change you like a remix .
Then ` I 'll raise you like a Phoenix , ' really made sense for where we were and what was about to happen . ''
Wentz told Kerrang !
how the track came about . ''
` The Phoenix ' was one of those songs that came along later , '' he said .
`` I was talking to Patrick and wanted a song that felt like the end of summer as teenage boys in the suburbs -- where you 're angry and full of everything but fear ... Those waning days when you ca n't be changed as an adult , but you do n't fit in the hand-me-down clothes anymore .
Basically , if Lord Of The Flies took place in Wilmette , Illinois .
Like , what if one year summer just never ended ? ''
