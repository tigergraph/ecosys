This features the pop singer Rihanna , who contributes a verse and sings the hook .
T.I. told Artist Direct how he got the Barbadian singer on board : `` It was a back and forth studio thing with Rihanna .
I picked her .
I was just able to ` Hear ' her voice on this record .
I could hear her , so I reached out and she said , ` Yes , ' thankfully . ''
In this song , T.I. discusses his growth and reconciles himself to his lot in life .
He also gives a dedication to the American troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In selling 334,000 digital downloads in its first week of availability , the song broke the record held by Mariah Carey 's `` Touch My Body '' of the most digital sales in a debut week .
Four months later the song 's record was broken by Enimem 's comeback single `` Crack a Bottle , '' which sold 418,000 digital copies in its opening week .
T.I. and Rihanna originally introduced this song at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards .
This had three separate runs at # 1 on the Hot 100 .
Prior to this , the only other songs to have three separate turns at the top had been `` Le Freak '' by Chic in late 1978 and early 1979 plus two other 2008 chart-toppers , Leona Lewis ' `` Bleeding Love '' and T.I 's other # 1 `` Whatever You Like . ''
This was produced by Just Blaze whose previous credits include `` Touch The Sky '' by Kanye West , `` Kingdom Come '' by Jay-Z and `` Breathe '' by Fabolous .
This song leapt from # 80 to # 1 on the Hot 100 , breaking the record for the largest vault to the top .
T.I. already held the record as the song this replaced at the top , `` Whatever You Like '' jumped from # 71 to # 1 six weeks previously .
One week later , Britney Spears took the record away from T.I. , when `` Womanizer '' leapt from # 96 to # 1 .
This samples the European pop smash `` Dragostea din Tei '' by the Moldavian trio O-Zone .
It was the source material for a well-known YouTube clip , the `` Numa Numa Dance '' , that shows Gary Brolsma dancing to this song .
Rihanna is officially credited as a featured artist on this track .
When this reached # 1 in the US , the Barbadian singer became the first female to achieve five chart-toppers in the 21st century .
