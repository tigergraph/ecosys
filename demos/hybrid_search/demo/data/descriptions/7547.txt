The third single from Take a Back Road is an uplifting cut that finds Atkins encouraging listeners not to get bogged down by life 's troubles .
`` Rodney Clawson wrote that song .
It 's about your happy switch , '' said the singer to The Boot .
`` You choose to be happy , and in life we have as many good days as bad days .
I try to find and record those songs that pull you through the bad days , and keep you believing that the good days are just around the corner.Sometimes it 's just a matter of singing -LSB- Atkins sings -RSB- ` oh , oh , oh ' when you feel that thing in your head , where you 're stressed out or messed up .
It 's crazy , but it works .
It carries you through some tough times .
I see the crowd singing ` Rock 'N Roll ' or ` Back Road ' at my concerts ... they are anthems and they lift up your life . ''
