Erykah Badu in Clutch magazine : `` It was a song I literally made up on stage in London in 1997 .
It was a spontaneous thing .
Later , I looked around and saw they were having debates about it on TV and radio .
They said I was male bashing .
I had no idea that it would have such an impact .
I was just making it up as I was going along .
As the song blew up , I realized that I had to take some kind of stance .
I began to challenge all the ` Tyrones ' to do better .
The song ` Tyrone ' did its job musically and socially .
Women loved it because that 's how they felt and men hated it because that 's how they were .
As a result , it became an anthem .
I 'm not apologetic for ` Tyrone . '
It 's the jam and I love it .
It 's one of my favorite songs to perform on stage and it 's still hilarious to me . ''
