Robbie Robertson invited a new generation of players to join him on his fifth solo album , How To Become Clairvoyant , and this song finds Rage Against The Machine 's Tom Morello guesting .
`` I was so impressed when Tom performed ` Tom Joad ' with Bruce Springsteen at the Hall of Fame 's 25th anniversary concert .
He gets amazing noises out of his guitar , '' said Robertson .
