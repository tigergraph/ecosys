Patrick Stump sings of someone wanting to be alone with their lover for eternity .
Bassist and lyricist Pete Wentz told Kerrang !
magazine : `` I really let rip lyrically .
Wanting to be alone together forever with someone is a feeling I 've had a gazillion times .
To me , this is more throwback Fall Out Boy . ''
The song is actually two different one tunes spliced together .
One was penned by Stump and Wentz , the other by guitarist Joe Trohman and both sounded coincidentally alike , with different perspectives .
Trohman told Kerrang !
: `` It was n't supposed to be a Fall Out Boy song , but it took the best aspects of the pop side the guys worked on and the aspects of mine which were kind of shoegazery , and made it almost cinematic . ''
