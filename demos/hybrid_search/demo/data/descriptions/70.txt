Guitarist Chris Howard told Artist Direct the story of this song : `` For ` Scarlet , ' we wanted to make a dark and eerie song , '' he said .
`` We started with acoustic guitars and came up with the main chord progression .
Once Maria -LRB- Brink , vocals -RRB- hears a musical piece , she comes up with all of these ideas .
We record it all .
Then , we 'll go back and listen to it and piece together parts .
She 'll work on the lyrics and come up with the concepts .
We just wrote in the studio , and it was a cool way to do it . ''
