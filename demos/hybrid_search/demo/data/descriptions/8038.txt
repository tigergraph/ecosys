Lady Gaga co-wrote two songs for Jennifer Lopez ' seventh studio album , Love ?
with her frequent collaborator RedOne - this song and `` Hypnotico . ''
Before becoming a `` Fame Monster , '' Gaga was a songwriter , who was hired by Sony/ATV Music Publishing to write songs for Britney Spears , Fergie , and the Pussycat Dolls .
Jenny from the Block admitted to MTV News that she ` lucked out ' with the Gaga/RedOne tracks .
`` I think RedOne 's sound is very specific , but he also can be very individual for each artist that he works with , which I like , but there 's still kind of a commonality in it , '' said Lopez .
`` But it 's him .
He makes a record sound so big and important ... When he would play me different tracks and even the beginnings of ideas and when he told me , ` Actually I worked with Gaga on this , ' and I was like , ` Really ?
That 's awesome .
Is it OK ? '
and he -LSB- was -RSB- like , ` Yeah , yeah . '
You know , they write and produce together a lot .
So , it was exciting .
I kind of just lucked out on that one . ''
