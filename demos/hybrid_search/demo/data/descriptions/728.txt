Final Fantasy 's Owen Pallett , who has arranged strings for the Arcade Fire , orchestrated the tracks on the album .
The London Metropolitan Orchestra recorded them over Christmas 2007 .
Alex Turner was particularly impressed by the work of Pallet on this track .
He told the NME : `` There 's a song called ` Meeting Place ' that he really brought to life .
When we were recording in France we did come up with some lines , just as initial ideas to send to him .
They were quite basic , but he built on that and then he came over for three days in December to record them .
We all got together in this hotel room and went through it all .
He has n't worked on too many albums before .
He 's our age and I think he did a bit on the second Arcade Fire record ` Funeral ' and ` Neon Bible ' and used to play with them , but I think he was inexperienced enough to have so much excitement for the songs .
He know when to leave it out - if it was on all the songs it would be bad - but he knew when we really needed something extra . ''
Owen Pallet explained to Drownedinsound.com about how he came to work on the album : `` Laurence Bell from Domino Records contacted me and asked me if I 'd meet Alex in Toronto .
Alex and I met in the bar of his hotel , he bought me a cappuccino , then we took a cab to my southern Toronto prison and we listened to some David Axelrod records and talked about music .
I listened to the tracks he 'd recorded , and told him my ideas , and then I scored it out in a couple of weeks , I flew to London and conducted it with an orchestra .
It was the most effortless project I 've ever worked on . ''
