Demi closes her fourth studio album with the most personal song , which tells of the singer 's personal struggles with mental illness , eating disorders and self-harm before her 2011 Unbroken set and how she rose from the public ashes .
`` That song was probably the hardest and easiest song to write on the album , '' she told Billboard magazine .
`` I was writing about personal experiences , and it 's the type of song where you ca n't fit all of it into one song - you ca n't put all of the emotions into one song .
It was the hardest song to write because it was the most vulnerable for me , and you ca n't sum up that experience in three or four minutes .
But it was the easiest song at the same time because it 's something that I wanted to say .
Like I said in the first line -LSB- of the song -RSB- , ` This is a story that I 've never told .
I got ta get this off my chest to let it go . '
I wanted to let it go . ''
This tale of a survivor is intended to be a sequel to Demi 's 2011 empowering ballad , `` Skyscraper . ''
