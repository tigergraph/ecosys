By the time they came to record On the Border , the Eagles had been saddled with the tag of `` Country Rock , '' but Don Henley and Glenn Frey wanted the band to move towards more of a hard rock sound .
However , they were still happy to record this bluegrassy tune penned by country singer-songwriter Paul Craft who 'd also had songs cut by Mark Chesnutt -LRB- `` Brother Jukebox '' -RRB- , Ray Stevens -LRB- It 's Me Again , Margaret '' -RRB- and Linda Ronstadt -LRB- `` Keep Me From Blowing Away '' -RRB- .
Henley later explained why in the liner notes for The Very Best Of The Eagles compilation : `` I was happy to do something in that vein , because I was a big bluegrass fan .
The Dillards , in particular , had an enormous impact on me .
Along with Doug Dillard and Herb Pedersen , Bernie Leadon was one of the top banjo players in the country , so I was proud to do a bluegrass tune - thought it lent a certain amount of authenticity and credibility to our band .
It showed versatility . ''
Apart from the aforementioned banjo contribution by Bernie Leadon , the track also features slide guitar by Glenn Frey with Randy Meisner handling the lead vocals .
