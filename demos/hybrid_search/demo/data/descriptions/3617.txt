Director Alistair Legrand was excited to finally put an old idea to use when he teamed up with Data Romance for this music video .
He remembers : `` The idea for this video came to me when I was listening to this song I really liked a lot .
I could n't stop visualizing these robotic forms engaged in this street-style battle dancing ... I kept thinking it would be perfect for a song that was n't hip hop . ''
Legrand stumbled upon `` jookin , '' a Memphis dance style that combined his robotic visions with ballet-like grace , and its master performer Lil ' Buck .
Along with co-choreographing the routines , Lil ' Buck and his crew performed in the video .
This song was featured on the TV series Lost Girl in the 2011 episode `` Fae Gone Wild . ''
Ajay Bhattacharyya told Toro Magazine why they chose Legrand to direct the video : `` When we found Alistair 's treatment , we gravitated toward it because it was so simple and barebones .
It was dark , and did n't try to paint a plot , like putting our song to a movie or something .
Guy-girl drama .
-LRB- His plan -RRB- appealed to us way more , the visceral quality of it .
I think there 's a lot of darkness in our music that is n't evident on the surface . ''
