This tune launched Irish rock band Ash 's A-Z Series of singles , which represents their attempt to break away from the traditional album format and its release schedule .
For the series of 26 songs Ash planned to release a new single every two weeks digitally , on vinyl and on CD , for which fans can either pay for individually or collectively by subscription .
Frontman Tim Wheeler told the NME : `` We wanted to be the first people to do it like this .
This is a time when you can try new ideas and it can work . ''
He added : `` I think it 'll be great for our fans waiting every two weeks knowing they 're going to get a song and wondering what it 'll be like .
It 'll be fun . ''
The song 's music video was shot in Portland , Oregon .
Daniel Garcia directed the clip , which featured Portland based model Meredith Adelaide .
