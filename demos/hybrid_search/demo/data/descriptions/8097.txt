This was originally recorded by Katrina Elan on her 2004 self-titled debut album .
McEntire told Great American Country : `` Katrina Elam co-wrote this song .
I am a huge fan of Katrina Elam .
She is one of the best singers I 've ever heard .
I asked Tony -LRB- Brown , producer -RRB- to ask Katrina if I could cut ' I Want a Cowboy . '
She came in and sang some of the harmony on it too .
It 's a great kick-ass song that is good attitude .
And I 'm a cowgirl ; I 've rodeoed 10 years and I 'm a third-generation rodeo brat , so I thought it was just perfect . ''
