Singer Nathan Leone explained this song to Kerrang !
April 4 , 2009 : `` There are a lot of temptations that tug at you in this world : girls , drugs , going out partying .
There are things you are n't meant to do , but there seems to be a devil on your shoulder telling you to do them .
This song is about that guy coming out at night when you 're restless and you feel like you have n't done enough living , Sid and Nancy style ! ''
