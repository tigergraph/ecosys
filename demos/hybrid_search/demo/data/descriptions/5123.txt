This is a track from American indie rock band , Built to Spill 's seventh studio album , There Is No Enemy .
Frontman Doug Martsch told Billboard Magazine that this is `` a real conventional kind of pop/rock song .
It reminds me of a Tom Petty song or something , but it probably does n't sound anything like that . ''
