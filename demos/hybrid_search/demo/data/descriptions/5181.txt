This tear-jerker about teenage love was co-written by Country Music Hall of Famer Bill Anderson , together with Sugarland 's Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush .
Anderson 's own recording in 1969 of `` My Life -LRB- Throw it Away If I Want To -RRB- '' was named the top country song of 1969 .
Since then his many writing credits include `` Whiskey Lullaby '' by Brad Paisley and `` Give It Away '' by George Strait .
The lyrical content of this modern take on 1960s teen tragedy songs is built around all those `` what ifs '' that run through your mind as you explore regret .
Jennifer Nettles said on the duo 's website : `` Nothing mitigates loss .
But everyone has regrets , so we can all relate . ''
Concrete Blonde and Bob Dylan also have songs called `` Joey , '' and while Kristian Bush is a big fan of the Concrete Blonde song , his Joey was titled after one of his best friends .
This Joey also shows up in the Sugarland song `` Everyday America '' in the lyrics , `` Joey stares at a trophy , took us all the way to state back in ' 85 . ''
This song was written backwards , which is a hallmark of Bill Anderson 's songwriting .
They started writing it from the end - where Joey dies - and worked their way back to the first line .
Kristian Bush said on the duo 's website of the alternative influences that went into the vocals , `` We ended up with a haunting wail in the chorus and this R.E.M. background vocal .
It 's simple and dark . ''
Jennifer Nettles spoke to Dave Dawson of Nu Country TV about this song : `` It 's so interesting - the theme of that song is a teen tragedy .
Remember back in the fifties there was a trend to have teen tragedies like `` Last Kiss . ''
It ended up the song we did with Bill Anderson is a modern take on that subject - it was pretty interesting He has a tendency to be very dark - it 's Country Gothic .
So for this song to turn out the way it did I was very pleased - we wrote it with him in Nashville in our hotel room .
It was really organic .
A lot of times songwriters have an idea they want to pitch to .
He came with an open palate .
We took the story line from there .
Someone finishes up dead .
It 's a mixture of Concrete Blonde and REM .
It has an alt sort of sound , like the late '80s . ''
Bill Anderson told Limewire that he had some concerns about this number .
He admitted : `` I was a little confused about this song .
Sugarland has been so hot , and they 've had several # 1 records right in a row , but this record has been so different for them that it did n't move up the charts as quick as some of their others have .
I do n't want to be known as the writer that killed Sugarland 's career ! ''
Anderson added that despite it 's slower pace , he stands behind the tune .
`` I think after people listen to the song a couple of times and hear what it 's about , they come away with a different feeling about it .
It 's one of the two or three songs that gets the biggest response in their concert show , so I think it 's a case of people listening to it .
It 's actually got a hidden message in there , if you take time to seek it and hear it out . ''
When they finished writing this song , Bill Anderson said that it had been a while since he wrote a `` teenage tragedy song '' like this one .
He then explained to the Sugarland duo that songs like `` Last Kiss '' and `` Leader of the Pack , '' which have tragic storylines , were popular in the '60s .
`` He gave us historical perspective for the song we were just writing , '' Kristian Bush told us .
`` Of course I glommed onto that like it was candy .
I was like , Okay , yes .
I will uphold that and I will make the music sound like that .
So when you hear the song , it 's supposed to be what those old songs were with the longing and the mourning of the girl that had lost her love in a car wreck . ''
