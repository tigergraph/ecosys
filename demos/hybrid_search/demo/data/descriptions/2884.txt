David penned this song with his former Midwest Kings bandmate , guitarist Andy Skib , before winning American Idol .
Skib is now a member of Cook 's backing band , The Anthemic .
The third songwriter is Daniel James of the Australian Pop/Electronica duo Dreamlab , who has penned songs for Selena Gomez -LRB- `` Hit The Lights '' -RRB- and Demi Lovato -LRB- `` Unbroken '' -RRB- .
Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter , Cook denied this was written with his former record company in mind , despite the fact it was his first new song after losing his recording contract with RCA .
He insisted it was a break-up song that came together very quickly .
The song was premiered by Cook on the May 10 , 2012 episode of the eleventh season of American Idol .
It was released immediately afterwards by 19 Recordings , the singer 's new label following his departure from RCA Records .
