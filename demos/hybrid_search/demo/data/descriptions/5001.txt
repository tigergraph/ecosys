Rossdale explained on Just Jared that this song is `` about relationships and how we 're always in trouble . ''
Rossdale told Rolling Stone , that when he was beginning Bush , Garbage founder Butch Vig got hold of a copy of the Bush demo tape .
Evidently liking what he heard , Vig considered Rossdale for the job of Garbage 's singer before Manson joined .
He explained : `` I heard he was interested and thought he was interested in producing my record , but it turned out he just liked my voice .
And they found Shirley before I was ever really considered , so I was a distant second .
Or probably more like 12th .
And now it 's sort of come full circle , because she sings on my record . ''
This features Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson .
Rossdale admitted on Just Jared that , `` At first Shirley did n't want to sing on it .
I wrote her and she wrote back and said , `` You persuasive bastard . ''
So she came to sing on it .
And she 's great on it . ''
Rossdale informed Just Jared that one of this track 's inspirations was Bob Dylan 's Desire album , `` especially `` Isis '' and `` One More Cup of Coffee '' with the great female voice blended in . ''
