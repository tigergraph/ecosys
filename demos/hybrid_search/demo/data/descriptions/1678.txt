Ask an Irishman who is their # 1 hated historical figure and many would nominate Oliver Cromwell .
After he overthrew the monarchy and temporarily turned England into a republican Commonwealth , Oliver Cromwell -LRB- 1599-1658 -RRB- embarked on an invasion of Ireland in 1649 .
His purpose was to reassert English control after the Irish had rebelled against Protestant English rule .
The vengeful actions of Cromwell 's army , particularly the battles of Drogheda and Wexford , in which thousands of civilians were massacred after the capture of the towns have made his name synonymous with English oppression in the minds of Irish nationalists .
Flogging Molly frontman Dave King told Alternative Press magazine how the British ruler inspired this song : `` There was a man by the name of Oliver Cromwell , who basically tried to wipe the Irish race off the face of the Earth .
I started off with ` Oliver Boy , ' then it goes into what 's going on in the Middle East right now - when will the stupidity of conflict actually end ?
I started off with him , and I brought it to the present day , because things have n't really changed in that area of humanity : fighting over land and religion .
Like , ` Oh my God , would you please stop ? ' ''
Another song to reference Cromwell in its title is Elvis Costello 's 1979 UK hit `` Oliver 's Army . ''
Morrissey 's 2004 UK # 3 hit `` Irish Blood , English Heart '' also brings up the controversial 17th century English statesman .
