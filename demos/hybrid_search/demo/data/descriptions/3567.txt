Lupe teamed up with Australian singer-songwriter Guy Sebastian for this R&B / rock hybrid .
Sebastian was the first winner of Australian Idol in 2003 and has gone on to become one of the most successful recording artists of the 21st century in his home country .
This was his sixth # 1 single in Australia - no other Australian male artist has ever achieved as many .
Fiasco came to Sebastian 's Sydney studio to record his rap .
He arrived with two versions of it already written , and after listening to his first war-orientated one , Sebastian decided it portrayed the emotion of the track so well that he did n't even need to listen to his second rhyme .
Speaking with Australian radio network Nova , Sebastian explained the song 's meaning .
`` It 's about your own personal battle scars , '' he said , `` and for every individual those are different ; some might be words or labels ... it might be relationship scars .
When I wrote this song , and when Lupe wrote his bits , we just really wanted it to be something that just inspired people to , sort of , confront those things , and also maybe try and work to think about burying and ripping up those labels ; throwing them away . ''
