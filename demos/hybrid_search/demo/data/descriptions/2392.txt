This is the second single released by SuperHeavy , a supergroup consisting of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger , Eurythmics founder Dave Stewart , white soul singer-songwriter Joss Stone , Indian musician and producer A.R. Rahman and reggae artist Damian Marley .
The song title is the national motto of India , which literally translates as `` Truth Alone Triumphs . ''
It was released on August 9 , 2011 and premiered exclusively on Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM across twenty-two Indian cities , a week before India 's Independence Day on August 15 , 2011 .
Rahman wrote the song after some gentle teasing from the others .
The Indian composer explained , `` In the daytime I was playing with them , in the night time and evenings I was gigging '' `` Then '' , added Jagger , `` He did n't come into the studio one day , so I said , ` Where 's A.R ? '
and he came in really late at night , really pleased saying , ` I 've got my song ! '
I manage one line in Urdu , only one ! ''
The song was composed by Rahman to have an Indian feel whilst Jagger sings in Sanskrit .
The other three band members also contribute .
