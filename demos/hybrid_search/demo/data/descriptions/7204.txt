This waltz time shanty sing-along finds White singing of heartbreak , as the newly-single protagonist of the song adjusts to their new status .
He is joined on harmony vocals by Pokey LaFarge and Ryan Koenig of St Louis-based American roots band Pokey Lafarge and the South City Three .
White told NME : `` This is one of my favorite things on the record .
I did it with this band called Pokey Lafarge and the South City Three .
I just played piano with them , and overdubbed the drums later .
It 's the only song on the record that I play drums on . ''
