This song about ambition and fame finds Bowie singing about Bob Dylan and his fellow Greenwich Villagers David Van Ronk and Phil Ochs , during the '60s folk boom .
The song is a tribute to the power and influence of the early '60s folk scene in the English Rock icon 's adopted home city .
Bowie 's longtime guitar sidekick Earl Slick plays on this track .
Slick recalled to Ultimate Classic Rock how his pal called him out of the blue in the summer of 2012 and `` said , ` I 'm ready to go back in .
What are you doing ?
Are you around ?
Are you touring ? ' ''
Once Slick said he was available they , `` started banging dates around , and he was already recording - and I went in and did all my stuff in July .
`` Bowie put a gagging order over the whole project and Slick told Ultimate Classic Rock how difficult it was trying to keep the Thin White Duke 's plans secret for months .
`` Do you have any idea how many interviews I 've done since May , with this under my belt , which I could n't say anything about ?
It was horrible ! ''
he said .
`` I had the cover for the Christmas issue of Guitar Player magazine .
That was the hardest one - it 's a double issue and it stays on the stands longer , and they did a 14-page spread on me , and I 'm thinking , ` Christ , I ca n't even say anything .
`` Anyway , he appreciated that - and I got a nice thank you for keeping my big mouth shut . ''
