This poignant climax to Welsh singer-songwriter Jodie Marie 's debut album was penned by the singer with album collaborator Ed Harcourt after the latter had heard the news that his friend Mark Linkous from Sparklehorse had taken his own life .
Marie recalled to UK music magazine Mojo : `` Ed and Mark Linkous from Sparklehouse were great friends .
I turned up at the studio the morning after Ed had found out that Mark had passed away and he was obviously upset .
I suggested giving him some space but he said he 'd rather try and write something .
We wanted to write something that was sad but beautiful . ''
