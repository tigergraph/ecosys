This instrumental is the title song of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish 's seventh album .
Imaginaerum was written alongside a movie of the same name and as the outro track , it was conceived to be played alongside the showing of the film 's credits .
Nightwish keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen came up with the idea of making a medley of the album 's main musical themes , and gave the band 's orchestral arranger Pip Williams free reign to make what he wanted of it .
