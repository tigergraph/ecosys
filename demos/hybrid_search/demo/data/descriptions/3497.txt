This was one of the first songs Wonder worked on with the engineers Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff , who invented the TONTO synthesizer and recorded an album with the instrument in 1971 called Tonto 's Expanding Head Band .
Wonder , who had recently negotiated a new deal with Motown that gave him his own production and publishing companies , tracked down Cecil and Margouleff , and enlisted them to build a TONTO and assist with his recordings .
The partnership was extremely productive , with the pair acting as engineers and associate producers on Wonder 's albums Music Of My Mind , Talking Book , Innervisions and Fulfillingness ' First Finale.On `` Superwoman , '' Wonder played the TONTO along with Fender Rhodes , drums and Moog bass .
He also handles all of the vocals ; the only other musician on the track is Buzz Feiten on electric guitar .
Stevie Wonder performed the song live with Mary J. Blige on a VH1 Diva 's Duets special .
Appropriate , since the first sentence in the song is : `` Mary wants to be a superwoman . ''
-LRB- thanks , Matan - Ashdod , Israel , for above 2 -RRB- The song is divided in two : the first part tells about Mary who tries to make her dreams of stardom come true , and the second part tells about the singer , wondering why did n't she come back when he thought she would .
