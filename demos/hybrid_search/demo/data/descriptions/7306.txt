This is a cover of a German opera song written in 1929 by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht .
It was used in a controversial 1930 German operetta called The Rise And Fall Of The City Of Mahogany .
The Doors got the idea for this from an album of German songs their keyboard player , Ray Manzarek , had .
A verse was omitted from the 1929 original .
It started : `` Show me the place to the next little dollar . ''
The themes of materialism , despair , and illicit pleasures from the operetta this was taken from would be revisited often by The Doors .
The song took on a more literal meaning over the years as Jim Morrison 's drug and alcohol problems became public knowledge .
In 2000 , the surviving members of the Doors taped a VH1 Storytellers episode with guest vocalists filling in for Morrison .
Ian Astbury sang on this track , and in 2002 joined Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger when they toured as The Doors of the 21st Century .
He fronted their group , which changed names after a lawsuit filed by original drummer John Densmore , until 2007 , doing about 150 shows .
