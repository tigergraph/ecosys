A track from Gilby Clarke 's first solo album , this song is one he wrote before joining Guns N ' Roses in 1991 .
The song is based on a real experience : he had a band called Kill for Thrills , and they decided to have a little fun across the border .
`` That song was about a time when a bunch of us went down to Mexico for a party week , and it got a little bit too drunk , '' Gilby told us .
`` We actually got thrown in jail . ''
At the end of the song , Gilby sings about stabbing the police officer in the neck with a switchblade .
This part was embellished for the sake of art , but there were some strange things afoot .
`` It was a surreal experience down there , '' Gilby said .
`` We did n't know what was going to happen when we went down there - we were just doing what everybody does when they go down to Tijuana , just getting drunk .
I do n't even remember a single thing that we did to get thrown in jail , but we did . ''
Along with `` Cure Me Or Kill Me , '' this was one of two tracks that featured Gilby 's G n ' R mate Slash on guitar .
When the band split up in the mid - '90s , members helped each other out on various projects ; Gilby was part of the first Slash 's Snakepit album in 1995 .
The lyric `` Send my love to my home but send my mail to a Tijuana Jail '' was inspired by a baseball call .
Gilby was watching a gave when the announcer called a home run by saying , `` Send my mail to the Tijuana jail ! ''
