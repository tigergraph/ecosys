Metronomy frontman Joe Mount told NME : `` This was the first thing we recorded for the English Riviera , so it was almost a test track for the studio .
At that point I was n't really sure how I was going to handle myself in a real studio , so finishing this felt like a big deal .
It 's still my favorite track from that record . ''
