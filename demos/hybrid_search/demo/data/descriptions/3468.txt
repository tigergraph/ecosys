Alison Goldfrapp explained during a performance at New York City 's Beacon Theatre that this song concerns a `` wicked '' daughter who beds her mother 's lover .
`` These things happen , but only in England , '' she joked .
The song is from Goldfrapp 's sixth album , Tales Of Us .
Goldfrapp used the inclusive pronoun in the title because the record is all about Alison Goldfrapp and her musical partner , Will Gregory 's emotional response to the uniquely affecting tales contained in the ten tracks .
