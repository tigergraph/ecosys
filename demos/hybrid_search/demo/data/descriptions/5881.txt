This melodic , introspective ballad is the oldest song on Little Voice .
Bareilles told Live Daily that she wrote it when she was about 20 .
Bareilles described the song 's music video on her MySpace blog , as , `` the literal interpretation of leaving Gravity behind . ''
This tells a story about someone who is deeply and passionately falling in love with someone they do n't want to fall in love with .
As the singer falls more deeply in love with him , she feels herself falling into his gravity every time she sees him .
It suggests they are in a very strong but secretive relationship .
