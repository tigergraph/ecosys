Many of The Tramp tracks find Van Etten reflecting back on a five year relationship that ended around the time of the release of her previous album , Epic .
She explained to UK newspaper The Sun : '' ` Leonard is about me looking back on a relationship and having three minds about it .
Having dual feelings about loving and losing and letting the past go . ''
