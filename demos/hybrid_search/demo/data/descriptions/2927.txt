This song is about anger at God .
Lead singer Isaac Brock lost many people close to him .
This song ponders : If God gives , why does he take ?
If he 's really so loving , why does he insist on total control ?
-LRB- thanks , Andrew - Abyss , PA -RRB- The song makes reference to Charles Bukowski , a German poet that is well known for his nihilistic writing style .
Bukowski is often ranked among the likes of Burroughs , Ginsberg , Thompson , and Kerouac .
The song asks , `` Who would wan na be such an a -- hole ? ''
