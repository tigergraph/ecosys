This is a love song addressed to Carla Bruni 's husband , former French president Nicolas Sarkozy .
She calls him `` sentimental but complex , '' and sings : `` Whatever fools say , Raymond is dynamite . ''
So why ` Raymond ? '
Bruni explained to UK newspaper The Sunday Telegraph : `` There 's already a song called ` Nicolas , ' and I wanted an ordinary kind of a name . ''
