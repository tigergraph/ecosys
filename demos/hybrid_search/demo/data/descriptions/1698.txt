This song was Williams ' first with his new songwriting partner Stephen Duffy .
Williams himself calls the song , `` Something like a mini gangster opera '' and `` Kind of cabaret act Reggae . ''
The line , `` First they ignore you , then laugh at you and hate you , then they fight you , then you win '' is a quote of Mahatma Gandhi .
-LRB- thanks , Martin - Rostock , Germany -RRB- The rolling rhythm of the song owes a lot to the early work of The Clash .
During the chorus Williams reaches a extremely high disco-like falsetto .
Lyrically the song is a bit darker than previous songs .
It tells the tale of gangsters and how they `` Do n't kill their own and all love their mothers , '' before an anguished chorus of , `` I 've taken as much as I 'm willing to take . ''
-LRB- thanks , Rob - ST Davids , Wales , for above 2 -RRB-
