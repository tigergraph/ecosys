Wretch 32 returned the favor when he featured on Angel 's debut single `` Go in , Go Hard , '' which peaked at # 41 on the UK singles chart .
This is his second single .
Speaking with Blues and Soul magazine , Angel explained the background to the song : `` Basically making ` Wonderful ' to me was all about being diverse and doing kinda like the non-expected .
Because while with my previous EPs - 7 Minutes Before Time and Any Minute Now - the majority of the elements in them are what people these days term ` urban , ' because I actually call my sound ' a pop fusion . '
What I wanted to do musically with ` Wonderful ' was make something that would appeal to a much wider audience . ''
So why Angel ?
Charles explained to Flavor Magazine : `` I 'm very spiritual ; I think I 've been put here to do angelic things , like send messages and heal people with music . ''
Regarding the song 's meaning , Angel told Blues and Soul magazine : `` In terms of the lyrics I basically just wanted to put across the message that , if you have anything in your vision that to your eyes is wonderful , then love it .
You know , do n't care what anyone else says - stay true to yourself and have fun !
And to me it 's that message - more than the beat being cool , or it being a pop fusion of different genres or what-have-you - that 's actually the most important thing about the record . ''
