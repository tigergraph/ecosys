Previously titled `` Morning M'Lud '' and `` Good Morning Mr. Magpie , '' and premiered by Yorke during a webcast back in 2002 as an acoustic ballad , this has been mooted for inclusion on every Radiohead album since .
According to guitarist Ed O'Brien , the band worked on the tune extensively in 2005 , before it finally found its way in a vastly reworked form onto The King of Limbs .
The song ends in a blur of bird song and reverb .
However , like all crows , the magpie is not musical - its cry being an irritating `` Ack-ack-ack-ack . ''
The magpie is a member of the crow family .
Whilst other birds collect twigs for their nests , magpies have a fondness for shiny objects , and have been known to steal jewelry .
This ` Thieving Magpie ' reputation was augmented by Gioachino Rossini 's 1817 comic opera of that name , which tells the story of a maid who was tried and found guilty for stealing silver .
Later it was discovered that a magpie , which had been stealing and hiding items in the church tower , was the true culprit .
Yorke alludes to the magpie 's light-clawed repute when he sings , `` You 've got some nerve coming here / you stole it all , give it back '' before adding .
`` You took my melody . ''
Other Magpie songs include :1994 Magpie by Blur , a B-side song to their hit single `` Girls & Boys .
`` 2005 `` Magpie '' by The Mountain Goats from their album The Sunset Tree .2008 `` Two Magpies '' by The Fireman -LRB- aka Paul McCartney -RRB- from his album Electric Arguments.Incidentally , trivia fans , Thom Yorke has said that `` Girls & Boys '' is the song by another artist that he wishes he 'd written .
