Lead singer Jon Foreman told NewReleaseTuesday about this song : `` This one started with the guitar hook I came up with during sound-check ; however , most of the song took shape in a hotel room in Australia .
I was thinking about how love -LRB- not just lust or co-dependency that commonly flood the tunes on the airways -RRB- actually involves quite a bit of faith .
There 's a lot of letting go involved .
Two souls in love is an intricate dance of give and take .
I can be a fairly solitary person from time to time .
Sure , I love being with people , but I also need time alone .
I guess I thrive on the poles .
So this song is about the dance involved in a relationship the coming together and letting go .
The song equates love with breathing - pulling in and releasing .
Or a seed , for the seed to grow it has to be dropped and buried.In our barcode media , love is often portrayed as consumption .
As consumers in a commercial driven culture we can begin to view other souls as objects , or potential cures for our deepest fears and insecurities .
`` Perhaps if I found the right lover I would no longer feel this deep existential despair . ''
But of course no human soul could be the Constant Other , the face that will never go away .
Only the infinite can fill that role .
But the silence can be deafening .
It 's a fearful thing to be alone .
Do you love me enough to let me go ?
`` I ca n't live without you '' - `` I would die if you ever left me '' - These are not the songs of love , these are the songs of consumption . ''
