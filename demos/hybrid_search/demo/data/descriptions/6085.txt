This song was a salute to `` Field Hollers '' ... where African American slaves would come up with these songs , also called `` Work Songs '' on plantations .
The song is written about Hendrix ' mother Lucille .
Recording this song was quite a process .
Hendrix did pretty much everything himself , including playing bass .
He also messed around with various phasing effects that show up on the song .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- The line , `` Two strange men fightin ' to the death over me today '' is a reference to 2 men claiming to be Hendrix ' father in an effort to capitalize on his success and money .
Neither man was Al Hendrix who was known to be his real father -LRB- Jimi 's real middle name was Allen -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , James - Los Angeles , IN , for above 2 -RRB-
