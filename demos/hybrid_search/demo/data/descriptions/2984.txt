This song is , more or less , about loneliness - but in a rather odd way .
The song tells the story of a restless ghost who is very lonely and longs to be `` human '' again , but knows that 's no longer possible .
Knowing this , he is attempting to convince a young boy to go to Hell and haunt with him , so he does n't have to be alone anymore , instead of going to Heaven and becoming an angel .
This is the last song on Ryan Adams late-2005 release , 29 .
With 9 tracks in total on the album , each song is supposed to represent - in one way or another - one year in Ryan 's twenties .
