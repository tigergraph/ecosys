Edward R. Murrow was a legendary CBS news broadcaster who was the first to appear on a television newscast -LRB- the show was called See It Now -RRB- .
He represents the standard for integrity in broadcast journalism , so when a network does something unethical , incompetent or stupid relating to it 's news division , it is often met with commentary that `` Edward R. Murrow is turning over in his grave . ''
As news divisions at major networks suffered budget cuts in favor of entertainment , Murrow has turned over quite often : a producer at CBS was fired when he interrupted the show CSI : New York with news that Yasser Arafat died , the show 60 Minutes relied on fake documents to report on president Bush 's National Guard duty , and some stations aired promotional material supplied by the Bush administration as actual news .
Of course , Murrow can not literally turn over in his grave - he was cremated .
