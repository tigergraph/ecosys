Hayley Williams explained the song 's meaning to MTV News : `` There seemed to be this thread in my brain about people who just really need to grow up and maybe open up their mind a little bit , '' she said .
`` And for me , as a girl , I 've always sort of done things the way that I wanted to do them , and sometimes you get backlash for that .
And I think it 's really important just to love who you are .
I mean , I learn it every day ; anyone who says they do n't have self-esteem issues is a bold-faced liar .
It 's really about self-empowerment and learning to leave those negative opinions behind and sort of look at those people right now and say ` Grow Up . ' ''
