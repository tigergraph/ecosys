This is the first single from American alternative rockers The Used 's fifth album , Vulnerable .
It was the first release on the band 's own label , Anger Music Group , an imprint of Hopeless Records .
The band left Warner Bros. after working with them for 10 years .
`` I Come Alive '' is the first single from the album and it is a metaphor for the rebirth of the band .
The Used bassist Jeph Howard likes the chorus of `` I Come Alive , '' which goes : `` I come alive when I 'm falling down . ''
He tells us the song is an anthem for the whole Vulnerable album , which is about the band members starting over mentally , musically , and emotionally after a decade of being together .

The Aaron Hymes directed music video was shot over the course of two days in California .
It shows a bullied teen taking revenge on his tormentors .
Said McCracken : `` The music video for ' I Come Alive ' is simply a piece of art to be enjoyed .
Our band in no way condones violence or teen bullying .
The song , for me , is about falling down or hitting the ground ; when things happen to you in life .
That 's pretty much what ` Box Full of Sharp Objects ' was about as well , on the first record .
Taking a hit can be the most inspirational thing that can happen to you . ''
Vocalist Bert McCracken explained the song 's meaning to Kerrang !
magazine : `` It 's an intense song .
It 's heavy and dark .
It reminds me of ' A Box Full of Sharp Objects ' and maybe ` The Bird and the Worm . '
It 's really theatrical and it 's about falling down , getting back up and moving on with your life . ''
John Feldman , who is the lead singer of the ska-punk group Goldfinger , produced this song .
He also helmed the rest of the album , having previous manned the boards for The Used 's first three albums .
According to his official website , Feldman holds a Guinness world record for his feat of performing 385 shows in 1996 .
