Vocalist Tom Chaplin said on Perfect Symmetry 's bonus DVD that the band 's chief songwriter Tim Rice-Oxley wrote this song , along with several others during the winter of 2007-08 .
Chaplin added that the song grabbed him as `` there is all this distress and pain is going on in the world and yet we have the luxury of burying our heads .
As the song says : turn up the song on the jukebox or whatever it is and that ability to distract ourselves and drown things out from our minds and so for me it felt like an incredibly pertinent song , a young westerner .
And I love it sonically as well .
Its just got a lovely , dreamy atmosphere and that was the key when it came to recording this dreaminess into it .
And then a great , huge rock out section and we 're really looking forward to playing that one live as well . ''
