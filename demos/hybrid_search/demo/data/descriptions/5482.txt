Hilson co-wrote this song , which describes the ecstasy of desire , with Justin Timberlake .
She told Digital Spy that producer Timbaland is `` so wishy-washy sometimes . ''
She explained : `` He 'll hate a song at first and then love it , and then maybe go back to not liking it as much as something else . ''
Hilson added that this track `` was one of those songs for him .
He liked it a lot at first and said it should be a single , but just as that was about to happen he called it ` bubble bath music ' .
But now he loves it again and thinks it should be a single !
He 'll really change it up on you . ''
