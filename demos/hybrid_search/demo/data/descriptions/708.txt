Weinland is an Oregon band whose sound USA Today compared to Neil Young .
Their frontman Adam Shearer told us : `` Sunken Eyes '' was a lucky break !
It 's probably my personal favorite track on the record and it just happened the night before we recorded it .
I had this little melody and chord progression in my head for a couple of weeks but just could n't come up with any direction for it .
Then somewhere out of the blue that `` sleep like a soldier '' line just came out of my mouth and I got really excited .
To me it paints such a clear picture of living with a sense of being unsure .
So I wrote a song around the idea of being unsure , or ill at ease , in your own home .
All of the lyrics represent some element of dismay I have experienced .
the lyric that says something like `` a sense of heartbreak all around , I can see it in this house '' is all about how messy my house gets when I am struggling with other things .
The lines that say something like `` old white doves float around , sunken eyes trickle out '' is about how when you 're arguing with a loved one you often go back to old patterns that usually include peace offerings and tears .
Its a simple song and that is why I like it .
We spent a couple of hours arranging it the night before we recorded it and then we just laid down the drums , guitar , bass , and piano live .
I think it came out pretty cool.All of the songs on Breaks In The Sun have a special meaning to me .
Each of them is a little diary entry , or snap shot , of where life was when we recorded them .
