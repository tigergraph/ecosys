This borrows lyrics from `` Woke Up This Morning '' by Alabama 3 -LRB- Also known as A3 -RRB- , which was used as the theme music for The Sopranos .
Nas explained to Rolling Stone magazine why they chose to sample this track : `` It was -LSB- his former manager -RSB- Steve Stoute 's idea .
When he told me , I thought it was the craziest thing ever .
What 's more gangster than The Sopranos ?
At the time , that was the s -- t , and for us to have that hook , and then find out it was some black choir who came up with the song , that whole thing worked out great . ''
