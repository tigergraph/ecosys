From SafetySuit 's first album , this is a rock ballad that infuses a clear description about a secretive but true love .
The lyrics lucidly explain someone 's true and deep feelings towards someone else that shares the same sorrow , happiness , passion ... about life and love .
It also portrays a powerful meaning about love that can last forever , if it 's real .
