Lead singer Joey Burns wrote this song .
He told About.com that it was inspired by the writer 's strike of 2008 .
Said Burns : `` I noticed late-night television going into this holding pattern , there being no fresh comedy as a breath of relief from the daily news .
That sparked my imagination : I wrote ` Writer 's Minor Holiday , ' a song about writers with nothing to do , suddenly abandoning Los Angeles .
I had this image in mind of this writer staring at a map , maybe a well-worn map that was a little out-dated , just wondering where they should go next .
In some ways , that parallels John and I 's lives .
This record is inspired more by traveling than being in the desert . ''
