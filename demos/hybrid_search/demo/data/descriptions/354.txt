This was written by Dan Hartman -LRB- `` I Can Dream About You '' -RRB- and Charles Midnight .
It was recorded by James Brown at the request of Sly Stallone for his film Rocky 4 .
Brown was a legend and known as `` The Godfather Of Soul , '' but the younger audience -LRB- especially the white audience -RRB- was generally unfamiliar with his work .
Jim Peterik , who wrote `` Eye Of The Tiger '' for Rocky 3 and `` Burning Heart '' for Rocky 4 , told us that Stallone was exceptional when it came to reinventing himself for a new audience and had a great sense for how to use music in his films .
Stallone could also be very convincing , and was able to put Brown in a position he was n't familiar with - singing someone else 's song in a mainstream movie .
The move paid off for Brown , as this song became his biggest hit .
The song won the 1986 Grammy Award for Best Rhythm & Blues Vocal Performance .
The horns were supplied by The Uptown Horns , a New York section that backed the J. Geils Band on their Freeze Frame album and played on `` Love Shack '' by The B-52 's .
The movie Rocky IV was over-the-top in its jingoism , as the boxer Rocky fights the evil Russian Drago .
In 1985 , the cold war was at a peak , and the underdog Rocky played very well with an American audience .
James Brown was used effectively in this context , as this song was used early in the film before American boxer Apollo Creed is killed by Drago in the ring .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA -RRB- In 1986 , Weird Al Yankovic recorded a parody of this entitled `` Living with a Hernia . ''
The original line `` got to have a celebration '' is replaced with `` got to have an operation . ''
