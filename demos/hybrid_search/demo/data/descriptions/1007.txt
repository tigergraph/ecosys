RJA vocalist Ronnie Winter told AOL Music this song delivers a message the Florida rockers are passionate about .
`` We have always supported various charities like To Write Love on Her Arms and the Take Action tour , which promote awareness against teen suicide and offer peer to peer counselling .
` Do n't Lose Hope ' is a direct message to those who feel like no one else cares , '' he explained .
`` God does , and always has . ''
