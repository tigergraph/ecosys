This track from American rock band OK Go features on the soundtrack of the movie , New Moon .
Frontman Damian Kulash told MTV News : `` We 're flattered .
It 's a really amazing set of bands .
It 's a huge deal .
We grew up listening to the Pretty in Pink soundtrack , and I sort of feel like this New Moon soundtrack is like Pretty in Pink for the new generation - foxy female lead , the kind of loser guy who becomes a sexpot and of course the 1,000-year-old witch/vampire type . ''
The song is about an astronaut who 's involved in a conspiracy and does n't know what to do .
Frontman Damian Kulash explained to examiner.com : `` Imagine if you were the human that the world looked to , like the glammed hero who set foot on the moon and changed the geo-politics of the era ; that singular human who was a huge part of history ... and it was all a lie .
The song was written from the point of view of an astronaut who wants to be the beacon of hope but still tell the truth . ''
Kulash told MTV News that the band have a bit of history with Twilight author Stephenie Meyer .
`` She asked us to play one of her book-launch parties , '' Kulash said .
`` She thanked us in the back of one of the books , because I guess she listens to our music a lot when she 's writing .
We feel a particular kinship with her , even though we 've never met her . ''
This song was also included on the `` Extra Nice Edition `` of OK Go 's third studio album , Of the Blue Colour of the Sky .
