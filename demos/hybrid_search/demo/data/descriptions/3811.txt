The title of the lead single from Shields , the fourth studio album by Brooklyn-based indie rock band Grizzly Bear , refers to a mountain in Utah .
The tune was posted on the band 's website on June 5 , 2012 .
Co-vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen wrote the song .
He has never visited Sleeping Ute but he told Q magazine , it 's along the road from a load of monuments in New Mexico that he has been to .
Rossen explained : `` I was reading about the area and the native culture there , the lost civilizations in that part of the country , and it has a really interesting creation myth .
The mountain looks like a sleeping warrior and with each season his coat changes - it 's a very peaceful story .
That part of the country really interests me . ''
