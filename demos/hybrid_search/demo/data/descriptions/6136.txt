Vocalist Ian Watkins explained this song to Kerrang !
magazine .
He said : `` I just wanted to write a song that said , ` c'mon lad , you ca n't be like this forever , sort it out . '
It 's not about anyone specifically , but I wanted to create that safety that everyone yearns for if they 've gone off the rails - being there for someone whether they want you to be or not . ''
