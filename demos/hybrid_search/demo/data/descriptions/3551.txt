Rudolf told djbooth.net : '' ` Let it Rock ' was written from a place of anger and dissatisfaction with the world .
It 's a song about hypocrisy .
It contains biblical references - and yet people still think it 's a party song .
Whatever works . ''
Rudolf wrote and produced this song .
Rudolf told MTV News : `` It 's a song about the hypocrisy in the world , and I 'm saying that when I come through , I 'm bringing the truth .
I use the parable of the Prodigal Son , because I want to expose all the fakes out there - in the music industry , in the world , anywhere .
A lot of people think it 's a party record , but it 's not . ''
