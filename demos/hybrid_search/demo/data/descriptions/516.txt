Simon Neil told Kerrang !
regarding this three-part symphony : `` It 's one of the weirder songs on the album .
We 've got a verse on there that 's just kazoo !
At the start I 'm singing , ` I 'll turn your baby into lemonade and it 's a spin on that idea of when life gives you lemons you make lemonade .
It 's taking the piss out of that saying .
It makes me sound like a right negative bastard . ''
The song has 16 kazoos on it .
Neil told NME : `` I had four kazoos in my mouth .
It felt GREAT . ''
Bassist James Johnston told The Sun : `` Kazoos just should n't work .
But that 's the weird thing about music - there are n't any rules .
You 've just got to explore to find out what does and what does n't work . ''
