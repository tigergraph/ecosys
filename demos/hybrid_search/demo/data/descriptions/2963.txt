Alec Ounsworth is the frontman of American indie rock group , Clap Your Hands Say Yeah .
This is a track from his debut solo album , Mo Beauty .
Ounsworth wrote this autobiographical song several years prior to the recording of Mo Beauty .
He told Rolling Stone : `` That was an older song and that probably has something to do with a darker time in my life , a particular incident .
I do n't wan na go too into it , but it 's kinda a small window into that .
I do n't recall when I wrote it , but I was n't taking what had happened all too seriously . ''
