This song is a homage to American composer Philip Glass , particularly his 1970 work Music With Changing Parts , whose repetitive motif slowly evolves over its hour long length .
`` With him , you start listening to it and an hour later it 's the same thing , but it sounds completely different and you just ca n't put your finger on it , '' frontman Geoff Rickly told Spin magazine : `` It 's amazing .
In our band , we 've got six people , and on ' A Darker Forest ' we try to all mimic each other , which is what Glass kind of does .
There 's something really hypnotic about it , but you ca n't tell what it is without studying it really closely . ''
