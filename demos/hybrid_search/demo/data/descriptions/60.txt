Speaking with AUX Magazine , Josh `` Deakin '' Dibb explained Noah `` Panda Bear '' Lennox 's lyrical content on this track .
`` For a lot of the lyrics on the record , '' he said , `` he wanted to spend more time looking outward than looking inward .
This one 's kind of about the frustration of trying to communicate with people .
Well , for him it was about trying to deal with a car salesman , when he bought a bad car and had to deal with all this nightmare stuff .
Just the frustration of complication between humans that should be like , `` I 'm a person , you 're a person , ca n't we talk like human beings ? ''
Various examples of radio interference and white noise are dotted throughout Centipede Hz , reflecting the album-long exploration of technology .
Deakin explained to AUX Magazine : `` Making this album , we talked a lot about imagining an alien band , picking up broken radio frequencies from earth .
All these scrambled different stations crossing over each other and cutting in and out , and imagining what it would be like if you were a band from an alien planet , hearing that stuff and trying to piece it together and re-interpret it .
That was a way that we established an over-arching marker .
` Mercury Man ' is a good example of that , the way the sounds move from part to part , and the sounds we were using fit that alien-band model better than any other song on the record . ''
