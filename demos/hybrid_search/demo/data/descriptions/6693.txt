Ben Harper 's tenth studio album , Give Till It 's Gone , found the alternative rock singer-songwriter collaborating with Ringo Starr on a couple of tracks .
One of them was this psychedelic instrumental , which was co-written by the ex-Beatle who also plays drums .
Harper noted in an interview with The Huffington Post , that Starr is one of the , `` four corners of creating psychedelic rock . ''
The song was created on the spot , and Harper described it to The Huffington Post as , `` the most improvised moment that I 've ever had on record . ''
Harper told The Huffington Post about writing with Ringo ; `` The creative process was - I had some ideas with him coming in , but I really wanted it to come from him and us collectively .
Me and my band had been his backup band for a bunch of shows and promotions , and the fact that he was willing to come in and do that on my record in the first place was huge , but we wanted it to be a co-write .
We wanted it to be something that was of equal contribution from myself , my band , and Ringo . ''
