This is a track from Getting Dressed In the Dark , the debut country music album of artist Jaron Lowenstein , who records under the name of Jaron and the Long Road to Love.The song tells the whimsical story of a fleeting infatuation at a traffic light .
All of the album 's tracks deal with matters of the heart and Getting Dressed In the Dark is about love in many forms : `` Why do I choose to write about love ?
Because that 's where I am right now , '' said Lowenstein .
`` I 'm not interested in writing stories about doors , or blue skies or whatever .
It 's not interesting to me right now . ''
