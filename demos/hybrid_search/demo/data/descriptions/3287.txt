Robert Smith based this on the deaths of his grandparents and the experience he had going to their funerals .
The Cure revisited this song on their 2011 DVD Reflections , during which they played their first three albums in their entirety .
The American Alternative Rock band Funeral Party named themselves after this song .
Lead singer Chad Elliot said : `` We chose the name Funeral Party because it was just the most depressing song I 'd ever heard ... it was the perfect name for a band like ours because we come from this jail town : no one gets out until they 're dead .
We also liked the name because it sounded like a hardcore band , but it had the word ` party ' in it , so it fit in on the East L.A. dance party fliers . ''
He added , `` Initially , that name tricked people into seeing us . ''
-LRB- SXSW , 2011 -RRB- In a 1983 interview with Rockerilla , Smith crystallized the emotions behind the songs and the method behind the lyrics : `` when someone you know dies you suddenly realize what death is .
Something takes shape in your mind , it 's not an indefinite , abstract entity anymore .
Even if my parents are still alive I could understand , it opened my eyes , you face great changes .
My lyrics are a miscellany of images taken from my mind .
I never think of a specific subject to develop . ''
He added , '' `` Killing an Arab '' or `` Fire in Cairo '' were based on specific subjects , but now it does n't happen anymore .
It 's not just personal images , but also events involving other people , real or imaginary ones .
The music has changed along with my changing feelings .
It was n't something I decided : it 's a spontaneous evolution caused by a certain moment 's stimulus . ''
