This blend of anti-war protest and brass band arrangements has become a Christmas radio standard in Britain .
The song is set in the Front during the Great War where a soldier in a trench wishes he was home for Christmas .
Lewie , whose real name is John Lewis , first hit the UK charts as a member of Terry Dactyl & The Dinosaurs with their 1972 # 2 hit `` Seaside Shuffle . ''
In 1980 he returned to the UK charts with the # 16 hit `` You 'll Always Find Me In The Kitchen At Parties '' before hitting the # 3 spot later in the year with this song .
Though he failed to chart in the UK again , his follow up single , `` Lousie -LRB- We Get It Right -RRB- '' was a hit in other territories including South Africa , where it topped the charts .
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England , for all above -RRB- Jona Lewie told the Daily Express on March 12 , 2005 : `` The soldier in the song is a bit like the eternal soldier at the Arc de Triomphe , but the song actually had nothing to do with Christmas when I wrote it .
There is one line about him being on the front and missing his girlfriend : ' I wish I was at home for Christmas . '
The record company picked up on that from a marketing perspective , and added a tubular bell .
The song went to number three in the UK , and topped the charts in several European countries . ''
