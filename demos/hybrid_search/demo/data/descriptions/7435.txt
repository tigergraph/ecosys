This is a re-recording of a song from Monroe 's 2007 , iTunes-only debut album Satisfied , and it holds a special place in her heart .
`` It came to me when I was about 17 and my manager at the time had just bought me this old 1950s Gibson guitar , '' she explained .
`` It came into my mind that things are worth more used , and I thought about my mom , who had lost my dad when she was 38 .
I was thinking , she had two kids , she 's been through a lot , and , bless her heart , it 's all gon na be worth it .
Vince -LRB- Gill , producer -RRB- and I worked up this new version , which made it fresh for me . ''
