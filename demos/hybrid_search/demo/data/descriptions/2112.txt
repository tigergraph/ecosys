This features John Legend .
The American singer-songwriter was originally intended to sing on a different track but then he heard an unfinished version of this song .
Green had been developing it with Corinne Bailey Rae and Legend immediately knew that this one was meant for him .
Green said on the EMI press release that this song illustrated the co-operative spirit that distinguishes the album .
He explained : `` John is singing it , I 'm singing it , Corinne and I are singing the background .
We 're all included .
It 's personal , about my own life , but still everyone can feel what I 'm talking about . ''
