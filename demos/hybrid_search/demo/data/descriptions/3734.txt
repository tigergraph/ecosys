Monsters of Folk are an indie supergroup made up of Jim James of My Morning Jacket , Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis of Bright Eyes , and indie singer-songwriter Matt -LRB- M. -RRB- .
Ward .
Mogis explained to Express Night Out a certain Liverpool group 's influence on this song : `` We 're all pretty influenced by the Beatles whether we know it or not .
I honestly about a year ago had sort of a resurgence with the Beatles .
And it comes from Matt .
When mixing his records - working on his solo stuff , or She and Him - he 'd always be like , `` listen to this Beatles song , listen to this George Harrison track . ''
That song is a seed from Matt Ward 's brain and we all kind of pitched in on it .
That would make the most sense because he - more so than any of the rest of us in the group - takes more influence from the Beatles than the rest of us , even though we all do . ''
