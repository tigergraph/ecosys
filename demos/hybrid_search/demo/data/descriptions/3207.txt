In this song , Tim McGraw is acknowledging the destructive and sometimes selfish side of his personality , which he identifies as `` the cowboy in me . ''
This was written by the coveted country songwriters Al Anderson , Jeffrey Steele and Craig Wiseman .
Anderson told us he is proud of the song , even though it is not particularly personal to him : `` I was just writing the song .
Jeff Steele came in with the idea and he had some of it done already , and he and Craig Wiseman just finished it with him .
So it has nothing to do with my life .
I do n't do that that much . ''
Set This Circus Down was McGraw 's seventh studio album .
It topped the US country chart , as did all four singles from the album : this , `` Angry All the Time , '' `` Grown Men Do n't Cry '' and `` Unbroken . ''
Anderson told us that he drew inspiration from the trucker radio stations that he listened to as a child when he wrote this song : `` My mom used to let me go to sleep with the radio on and I could get WBBD when I was a kid , in Wheeling , West Virginia .
It was a trucker station and it came in at night all over the country .
So when I was 8 , 9 years old , I was glued to that station at night .
I fell asleep with it every night . ''
