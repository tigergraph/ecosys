This is one of three new songs on British R&B singer Lemar 's greatest hits compilation , The Hits .
He discussed this song with Blues and Soul magazine : `` I recorded like 30 songs to get down to the three new ones that we finally included on there .
And for me , the key thing was to be different and to be experimental .
You know , it 's the fifth album , a greatest hits celebration - so you 're definitely gon na get your staple Lemar vibe within the course of the record .
So - in terms of the new tracks - my thought was , ` Why not mess around a bit while keeping that soul voice , and try to show some different angles ? '
So with ` You Do n't Love Me ' - as opposed to it being your standard love song where you 're hearing me crooning about someone - I 'm taking another stance and saying ` You keep accusing me , but you 're the person who does n't love ME ' ... You know , I 'm trying a different approach , and there is that bit of anger in m voice .
Which is something people really have n't heard too much of from me before . ''
The song features a sample from The Supremes ' 1960s Motown hit `` You Keep Me Hangin ' On . ''
