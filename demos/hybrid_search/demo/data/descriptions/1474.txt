According to Animal Collective multi-instrumentalist Josh `` Deakin '' Dibb 's track by track interview with AUX Magazine , the band took a lot of convincing to include this on Centipede Hz , especially Panda Bear , `` who saw it as a side note or something . ''
Eventually they became `` really attached to it .
`` Deakin went on to explain that Avey Tare felt he wanted to do something different other than guitar , `` so he started making electronic stuff instead . ''
However he retained Deakin 's guitar part .
`` It was this really cool blending of this kind of digital musical world and more fun Grateful Dead kind of stuff , '' said Deakin .
`` I think it brings these two worlds together .
I really like that one a lot . ''
Dave Scher -LRB- Beachwood Sparks , All Night Radio -RRB- played a melodica on this track .
The melodica is a harmonica/accordion hybrid with a musical keyboard , which is played by blowing air through a mouthpiece .
British radio DJ Johnnie Walker gets a shout-out in a sample at the end of this track .
Brian `` Geologist '' Weitz told eMusic he found the audio clip online : `` That one in particular was from a British pirate radio station where the DJ 's name is actually Johnny Walker , '' he explained .
`` There 's a group of people that collect those aircheck tapes online , so I spent hours and hours listening to them .
It was a little mind-bending .
I tried to stick to stations that some of us might have heard , but eventually I had to stretch out to other markets . ''
