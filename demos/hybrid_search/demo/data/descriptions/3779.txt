This is based on a 1935 novel of the same name by A. J. Cronin , which was also made into a film in 1939 .
The book tells of an English mining town pre-WWI following families and their trials and triumphs , particularly a young man who is a miner and tries to change the conditions for which miners work , but in the end looses his battle for change in parliament and also his wife .
He gained nothing and returned to be a miner .
Neil Peart -LRB- who wrote this -RRB- lost his wife to cancer .
In the Vapor Trails tour book , he wrote : `` This seemed to express a fitting view of an uncaring universe . ''
