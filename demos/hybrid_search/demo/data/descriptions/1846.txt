Benjamin Francis Leftwich -LRB- Born September 4 , 1989 -RRB- is an English singer-songwriter from York .
Leftwich began playing music at the age of ten and grew up listening to The Rolling Stones and Nina Simone before discovering such singer-songwriters as Nick Drake , Bob Dylan , and Elliott Smith .
He decided to use his middle name as part of his stage moniker as he felt Ben Leftwich was `` a bit too snappy . ''
Leftwich told Gigwise why he named the LP after this track .
`` It was do to with the fact that it was the last song written for the album , '' he explained , `` that last piece of the puzzle before things kick off .
The song and particularly its title encapsulated that and so it made sense to name the album after it . ''
This is the title track from his debut studio album , which was released on July 3 , 2011 in the United Kingdom .
Leftwich explained the song 's meaning in an interview with The Sun : `` It 's a reference to that moment of quiet before the storm .
That moment of being chilled before everything happens , which is a reference to the state of mind I was in before making the record . ''
