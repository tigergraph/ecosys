Joe Goddard -LRB- vocals , synthesizer and percussion -RRB- told The NME February 6 , 2010 about this heartfelt ballad of brotherly love : `` We went on tour with Matthew Dear a couple of years ago .
He wanted to write a song about the brotherhood of being bands on the road .
I thought it was a good idea , so I started writing it , but it turned out to be more of a song about my brother .
I 'd like it to be played in gay clubs , because women have more songs of that nature , such as ` We Are Family ' by Sister Sledge , so I felt like men needed one . ''
