This Country tune is the lead single from Sheryl Crow 's first release through Warner Music Nashville .
`` A lot of Country artists write about or have been writing about like going away to Mexico or the Caribbean , '' Crow explained in a CMT News interview .
`` Toby Keith , Alan Jackson ... and I love all those songs , but my little brother 's my gauge , and he 's like , `` We ca n't afford to go to the Caribbean ! ''
And I was like , `` OK , let 's write a song about ` staycation ' - about staying home when you ca n't afford to go to the Caribbean or wherever or on your yacht .
And making your home feel like you 're getting away .
And that 's what it 's about . ''
Crow co-penned this song with her longtime guitar player and frequent co-writer Jeff Trott -LRB- `` If It Makes You Happy , '' `` My Favorite Mistake '' and `` Every Day Is A Winding Road '' -RRB- .
The music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy and stars Crow alongside Jason Lewis , who 's best known for playing emerging actor Smith Jerrod on Sex and the City .
