Vocalist Scooter Ward left nothing to the imagination when he penned this song .
He told Noisecreep : `` When I was writing ` What Happens Now , ' I had set out to write a song for one of my favorite super heroes , Spider-Man .
I completely got all my old and new Spider-Man swag out of the attic and laced it throughout the house so it was everywhere .
I had the movies displayed on the big screen all day , all night .
I had approached writing a song for the PlayStation game ` Psi Ops ' a few years back the same way and it came out great .
It puts you in a different place in your head for a minute .
Opens the imagination .
I 'm trying Batman next ! ''
