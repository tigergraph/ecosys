This Hit-Boy produced track finds Minaj at her most brash , as she brags about her record sales -LRB- `` Pink Friday , two milli ; Super Bass , triple plat '' -RRB- and the famous company she finds herself in -LRB- `` When you see me on Ellen , just admit that I 'm winnin ' -RRB- .
It is a return to her original brazenness , that originally showed up on such pre-fame tracks as `` I Get Crazy `` from her 2009 mixtape Beam Me Up , Scotty 's .
`` I always thought I could write pop songs for someone else or I could write R&B records for someone else , but I did n't think that people would accept me writing those type of songs and me singing them and just being who I am , '' Minaj told Complex magazine .
`` And I guess that 's the point ... The goal is to not want their acceptance , the goal is to just do you and they 'll come around . ''
The lyric , `` 7up went and gave my commercial to Cee-Lo , '' finds Minaj taking a shot at singer-songwriter and Voice judge Cee-Lo Green after he was enlisted for the drink company 's ad campaign .
At the time she tweeted to her followers that , `` it would have better if I done it . ''
Minaj told Artist Direct that the song contains both facets of her personality - `` the hardcore side and the theatrical side . ''
She added that she , `` wanted to write a song that was talking real s -- t from beginning to end .
Everything I 'm saying is facts .
I 'm not rapping just to make things rhyme or have a metaphor .
It 's factual , but it has that cocky swag people know me for .
We get theatrical on the hook .
I think what makes that song is that low feel , tone , and beat .
That beat takes you on a journey . ''
The lyric , `` When I 'm sitting with Anna , I 'm really sitting with Anna .
Ai n't a metaphor , punchline , I 'm really sittin with Anna , '' refers to Minaj finding herself sitting next to Anna Wintour , the Vogue magazine editor-in-chief , at a fashion show .
Initially , Hit-Boy 's bass-heavy beat did n't suit Minaj 's needs , but it proved to be an easy fix .
`` The tempo was a bit slower so she was like , ` Can you speed this up ? '
I sped it up , and she hit me back like , ` Yo , this is crazy , I 'm writing to it , ' and -LSB- she -RSB- just kept having me send beats , '' he told MTV News .
The Grizz Lee-directed video finds Minaj taking fans through a day in her life , and features appearances by Waka Flocka Flame , Tyga , and Birdman .
We also Minaj hanging out at the BET Awards together with such luminaries as Kim Kardashian , Beyonc√© , Jay-Z , and Kanye West .
