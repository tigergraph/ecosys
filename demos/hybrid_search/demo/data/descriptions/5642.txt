Jason Aldean explained during a Live On Letterman concert how this atmospheric ballad fulfilled his desire to have his own song about life on the road like Bon Jovi 's `` Wanted Dead Or Alive '' and Bob Seger 's `` Turn The Page . ''
`` It talks about being on the road , '' he said , `` being an artist and some of the things that go on and how your life is . ''
Neil Thrasher , Wendell Mobley and Hillary Lindsey penned the song specifically for Aldean .
`` We had been doin ' ` Wanted Dead or Alive ` on the road as one of our encore songs , '' he explained to Billboard magazine , `` and we were talkin ' one day that it would be cool to have our own song like that , that sort of feel .
And they wrote ` Wheels Rollin ' , ' around me and my lifestyle and what 's goin ' on .
I heard it the first time and I was like , ` OK , that 's gon na be on the record . '
It 's perfect for me , perfect for my show .
For anybody that wants an inside look at what it 's like to be me on the road and get inside my mind a little bit on what it 's like , that 's the perfect song . ''
