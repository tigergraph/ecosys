This is the first single in the US by Scottish singer-songwriter and guitarist KT Tunstall , from her third studio album , Tiger Suit .
The song is more upbeat and urgent than Tunstall 's UK lead single , `` Still a Weirdo . ''
The singer 's record company chose it for the American market as they felt the tune would play better at US radio .
Tunstall told Billboard magazine just after the song 's release : `` I may lose some fans of the old stuff , but I get the feeling I 've already made a few new ones by embracing a bit of experimentation . ''
Tunstall expanded on the song to M Is For Music : `` The song is about when I met someone who had a really negative effect on me , and even though they were still alive , I experienced these almost visitation-like hauntings that I could n't shake off .
I took to wearing a t-shirt with the person 's name on to try and exorcise them , which finally worked . ''
Tunstall explained to MusicRemedy.com that this song is about a person who haunted her for many months .
`` The person is still very much alive , but my interactions with them led to these weird , almost visitation-like feelings that I found difficult to shake off . ''
