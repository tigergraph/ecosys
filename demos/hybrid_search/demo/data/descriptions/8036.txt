Yannis Philippakis told NME that the song title is an image he liked meaning `` white and black . ''
He added : `` Lyrically , there 's unfettered optimism and belief in the capability of another person to save you .
That feeling when you meet another person and you do n't feel like you need anything else after that .
That 's your medicine and your joy all in one . ''
