This lo-fi contemplation is one of several songs that frontman Ben Bridwell wrote whilst staying in a cabin in Minnesota at the Canadian border just staring out at the lake .
He explained to The Skinny : `` I was messing with this synth guitar thing and I ca n't play piano at all but with the synth guitar I could make guitar shapes and piano sounds would come out , so I just wrote in a little journal while staring out at that lake . ''
