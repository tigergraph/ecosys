Scotty McCreery was born and raised in Garner , North Carolina and this song makes him think of his hometown .
He explained : `` It reminds me of Garner , which has a big water tower right across from the baseball fields where I grew up playing ball .
It has a lot of elements in there that remind me of Garner .
The first lyric in the chorus is , ` Friday night football is king , ' and that is true in Garner .
Everybody stops what they 're doing in Garner to go to the game .
It 's been tough on me missing the games being out here on the road , but I will be back for a few .
The song says , ` Sweet tea goes good with anything , ' and that is all we drink back home .
All of the lyrics really relate to my hometown . ''
The song was written by Tammi Kidd , whose compositions have been covered by a wide range of artists including Rascal Flatts , Josh Gracin , and Chris Cagle , Nashville singer-songwriter Cole Swindell , and Lynn Hutton whose previous credits include Joe Nichols ' `` Comon ' Back In a Cadillac . ''
