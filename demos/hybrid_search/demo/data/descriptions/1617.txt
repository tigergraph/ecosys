We Walk This Road is a mixture of original material written as a collaborative effort between Robert Randolph , producer T-Bone Burnett , Tonio K and Peter Case with covers spanning a century of American music , as interpreted by Randolph and Burnett .
Randolph told the story of this song to Crosswalk : `` One day we were all having lunch together while T-Bone and Bob Dylan talked on the speakerphone .
We were all just eating , laughing , joking .
Next thing you know , we come down -LSB- to the studio -RSB- and we were just jamming .
The drummer started playing , and everyone joined in .
So we got this little groove thing going .
T-Bone starts mumbling some words , singing along .
So we agreed that we had a nice piece of music , and that we should take a break and try to write some lyrics to it .
While we were doing that we were watching a presidential debate on TV , and we all agreed that we just wanted to be told the truth .
So that 's where the lyric ` Keep on talkin ' , I 'm not listenin ' came from .
We just started writing all these lyrics about anything that was relevant to that . ''
Tonio K is an American singer-songwriter whose songs have been recorded by the likes of Chicago , Al Green and Vanessa Williams as well as collaborating on music with Brian Wilson and Burt Bacharach .
He told us that he got involved on We Walk This Road after T-Bone Burnett called him and said , `` Hey , I 'm producing a record for Robert Randolph and he 's got a bunch of tracks and licks , but no songs .
Do you want to get involved ? ''
`` And I went , ` Sure , ' '' he added .
`` So that was a whole thing that went on for over a year . ''
