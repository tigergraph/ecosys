This track was inspired by a plot device used in Greek plays , called deus ex machina , in which a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly solved by a contrived and unexpected intervention .
In the case of this song , it 's Santigold stepping into her own life to solve her own problems .
`` It 's me talking to myself , '' she told Spin magazine .
`` It 's a pep talk song .
The chorus is , ` You can make it alone if you try ! '
It took me three months to finish those lyrics .
At first I was like , ' I ca n't say that . '
Finally I was like , ` It 's not the most creative lyric , but it 's the one . ' ''
`` I had to re-establish a creative confidence , '' she added .
`` And now I feel stronger than ever . ''
