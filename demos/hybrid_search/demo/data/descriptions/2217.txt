This is the title track of English folk singer-songwriter Laura Marling 's second album .
The disc was recorded as live onto tape and plays in the order the tracks were recorded .
It was produced by Ethan Johns -LRB- Kings Of Leon , Ryan Adams , Paolo Nutini -RRB- , who also plays a selection of unusual instruments including a sitar on this track .
Marling told Q magazine she believes this song to be her most inspired moment to date .
She explained why : `` I thought I 'd finished writing the album -LRB- of the same name -RRB- , then that song came and for me it totally brought together the rest of the album .
It made me realise what I was talking about .
That song is quite punchy and it 's about strength , and standing up and doing what 's necessary .
I think for me it was a slight shift in confidence . ''
In this song Marling gazes back into Greek mythology as she steps into the skin of Penelope patiently awaiting the return of her husband Odysseus from his travels .
She told The Guardian how this song was written in the studio and rehearsed just once before it was recorded .
`` I guess it 's a mini folk power-ballad , '' was how she described it .
`` I feel proud of it because of what it meant for me , that strength . ''
Marling added : `` Probably the most pretentious thing I can say about the album is that there 's definitely a theme in there , something that I think about a lot , which is womanhood and what one 's role is in the world - just feeling the weight of womanhood , or the greatness of it . ''
When asked by Q which lyric best describes her , Marling replied : `` I guess ` anyone I trust enough to listen ' -LRB- from this song -RRB- is the most honest lyric I 've ever written . ''
