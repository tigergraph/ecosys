The first single from Rihanna 's sixth album is an upbeat dance track , which finds the Bajan beauty singing about finding that special someone .
`` Yellow diamonds in the light , she croons , `` And we 're standing side by side .
As your shadow crosses mine ; What it takes to come alive . ''
The song premiered on September 22 , 2011 , on London radio station Capital FM and was released on the same day for digital download in the US .
Following the song 's premiere , Harris tweeted : `` Wowow many good comments about song with @Rihanna so happy u like it , i told u she sounded like an angel !
THanks #RihannaNavy !! :D '' Part of the music video was shot in a field in the Northern Irish town of Bangor on September 26 and 27 , 2011 .
The farmer who owned the land on which Rihanna was filming was shocked to have spotted the Bajan beauty half naked when he was walking to his tractor .
He told BBC News : `` I thought it was inappropriate .
I requested them to stop and they did .
I had my conversation with Rihanna and I hope she understands where I 'm coming from .
We shook hands . ''
After being asked to leave the field , the singer continued to shoot the promo in Belfast .
Following a stint as her support act on the Australian leg of her tour , Calvin Harris was asked by Rihanna to write a song for her next album .
After she turned down several attempts by the Scottish electro wiz , she finally agreed to record this track .
Rihanna 's love interest in the video is played by model and former boxer Dudley O'Shaughnessy .
According to insiders , she had seen his modeling shots and other pictures when he was a boxer and handpicked him for the role .
Calvin Harris also makes a brief cameo appearance during the party scene in a muddy field , popping up behind the decks .
The clip was directed by Melina Matsoukas , who previously was responsible for Rihanna 's visuals for `` Rude Boy '' , and the controversial `` S&M . ''
Matsoukas explained to MTV News that the video is not intended to refer back to the singer 's past experiences with domestic violence , but rather it 's a warning about the dangers of addiction . ''
-LSB- The song 's -RSB- totally rave-y ... and that 's the feeling , just music rushing over you , and then I started thinking about drugs and addiction and love and how that 's an addiction , '' she said .
`` We 've all lived the ups and downs of being in a toxic relationship .
It 's really about the obstacles of trying to let it go , but at the same time how great it makes you feel , so it 's hard to let it go . ''
The song 's eight consecutive weeks at # 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 broke Rihanna 's personal record of seven with `` Umbrella . ''
Actor James Franco was asked to play Rihanna 's boyfriend in the video before Dudley O'Shaughnessy took on the role .
Franco told MTV News : `` She actually asked me to be in that video , the one with the relationship that gets crazy .
I could n't do it .
But , I guess , I hope that that means there 's mutual love between us . ''
Speaking with Q magazine , Harris admitted the line `` we found love in a hopeless place '' did n't mean anything in particular .
`` It could have been Jumpin Jaks in Dumfries , '' he acknowledged , `` although that has sadly closed down .
The thing is , I do n't know exactly what I was thinking about .
I was just playing the song and doing nonsense singing to see if the syllables fitted the song .
It was like that .
I was singing nonsense and that 's how the lyrics happened . ''
According to British singer Leona Lewis , she was originally given this song but , preferred her single `` Trouble . ''
Lewis told The Daily Star Sunday : `` I worked with Calvin and we recorded ` We Found Love . '
But he went touring with Rihanna and she ended up releasing it.I did n't commit to it because I wanted ` Trouble . '
to be my first single , '' she added , `` so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna .
It was the same version and production but mine 's better . ''
Nicole Scherzinger also turned down the song .
`` I passed on ` We Found Love . '
I got the demo of that song and I was busy at the time , '' she revealed to Notion magazine .
`` They 'd sent me a few dance tracks and I was n't able to get to them and I was like , ` Oh , there 's so much dance and I want to take a break from it ' .
That was my fault .
I slept on it . ''
The song is a collaboration with Scottish electro-pop producer Calvin Harris , who is best known for his work with Dizzee Rascal , Kelis and Kylie Minogue .
He 's also scored a series of Top Ten singles under his own name in the UK including the chart-topping `` I 'm Not Alone , '' which was later sampled by Chris Brown on his own hit `` Yeah 3x . ''
Harris told London 's Capital FM that the Bajan singer 's followers - often called Rihanna 's Navy - were putting pressure on him via Twitter before it was released to radio .
He confessed : `` It was crazy all the fans on Twitter , tweeting me saying : ` The song better not be rubbish ' before they heard it .
There were some mild threatening nature to them , but it 's all part of the fun .
She sounds great on it . ''
The song found the top ten of the Hot 100 , jumping 16-9 in the chart week ending October 15 , 2011 .
It was Rihanna 's 20th top 10 entry , her first being `` Pon De Replay , '' which arrived in the top tier in June 2005 .
The span of six years and four months , overtook Madonna 's collection of first 20 top 10s , which stretched six years and nine months to achieve a new best for a solo artist .
This was Rihanna 's sixth British # 1 , which has been spread over five consecutive years , a record unequalled by any other female solo artist .
The Bajan singer had previously scored chart-toppers with `` Umbrella , '' `` Take a Bow , `` Run This Town , '' `` Only Girl -LRB- In The World -RRB- '' and `` What 's My Name ? ''
between 2007 and January 2011 .
The gritty video portrays Rihanna as addicted to both her lover and to drugs , and she and her beau end up abusing each other .
The Bajan singer was criticized by anti-rape campaigners over concerns she is portrayed in the clip as `` an object to be possessed by men '' and they questioned the message it sends to impressionable fans .
Eileen Kelly of the Rape Crisis Centre told Britain 's Daily Star , `` Rihanna 's new video is a disgrace .
It sends the message that she is an object to be possessed by men , which is disturbingly what we see in real violence cases . ''
Talk That Talk 's debut at # 1 on the UK albums chart coincided with this song 's sixth week on top of the UK singles chart .
Having already reached # 1 on the two main tallies simultaneously earlier in 2011 with `` What 's My Name '' and Loud , Rihanna became the first ever female artist to achieve the Official Singles and Albums Chart double twice in the same year with different singles and albums .
During the song 's tenth week at # 1 on the Hot 100 , Rihanna ended up bookending the chart as `` Talk That Talk '' re-entered at # 100 the same week .
The previous time this happened was on March 1 , 2008 when Flo Rida 's `` Low '' topped the chart whilst `` Elevator `` was placed at # 100 .
The song topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs for two consecutive weeks , the only track to remain at # 1 on that chart for more than seven days in 2011 .
The visual won the Video of the Year award at the 2012 VMAs .
This was the most played song on US airwaves in 2012 .
It was followed by Flo Rida 's `` Good Feeling '' in second place and The Wanted 's `` Glad You Came '' in third .
