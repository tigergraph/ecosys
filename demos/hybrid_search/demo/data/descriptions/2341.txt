Cat Stevens once said about the style of violins played at Greek weddings , `` It 's just the feel of the note . ''
You can hear the violins , especially at the end of this .
The song is a betrothal between Stevens and a personified spirit , The Light .
Through all the albums that follow , Stevens consistently uses this colour symbol , White .
He divides the female figures in his life into spirit , light - white and flesh , blood - red .
`` Into White '' from Tea for Tillerman defines this view of his world .
The division starts with his lyrical burial of Patti d'Arbanville on the song `` Lady D'Arbanville , '' where he sings , `` This rose will never die , '' and carries on in `` Ruby Love '' from Teaser And The Firecat and in `` Sweet Scarlet '' from Catch Bull At Four .
You might ask where are they in Tea for the Tillerman ?
Alice 's chess board has two sides , the wooden Red Queen is a very Hard Headed Woman , and you can find Alice -LRB- white -RRB- in `` Sad Lisa , '' if you listen carefully -LRB- and there are those violins again -RRB- .
The songs that complete Mona Bone Jakon : `` Katmandu , '' `` Time , '' `` Fill My Eyes '' and the `` LillyWhite '' are the most personal and saddest songs he ever wrote .
-LRB- thanks , Glenn - Dunedin , New Zealand , for all above -RRB- Stevens told Mojo magazine June 2009 that this song was the result of `` an amazingly bad trip '' He explained : `` I was at Noel Redding 's house , we were on tour and he introduced me to this substance ... That was the worst night of my life !
It was in his flat in Clapham Common .
By the time I got to dawn and I was able to get out of the door it had snowed and it was like looking at an angelic gift from heaven !
It was beautiful .
Now , the song represents a recapturing of that moment where after darkness comes light . ''
The title comes from rhyming slang .
The verses of `` Lillywhite '' use two more symbols : `` The Dial '' / `` Wheel Of Change , '' which is a reference to the Buddhist concept of cycle , and the `` mended road , '' which is Steven 's path/way .
Stevens uses numerous examples of `` roading '' terminology to symbolize the path , starting with his song `` On the Road to Find Out . ''
This is British comedian Ricky Gervais ' favorite song .
He told Stevens that if he ended up on a desert island with one song , it would be this one .
