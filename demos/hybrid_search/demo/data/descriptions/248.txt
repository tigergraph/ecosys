Perhaps you 're wondering why the cat turned blue .
We were , so we asked Rusted Root frontman Michael Glabicki , who wrote the lyrics to this song , for details .
He explained : `` I think it 's one of those things where it either makes sense to the individual , or it does n't , but it 's nothing that I could explain .
Some people draw from it and go , Oh , it at least feels good or I understand it .
Some people think it 's about an overdose , so I 've heard that a lot .
Sometimes I write songs and you know that there is something going on there , but everybody 's going to draw their own meaning from it.And it 's not a matter of it needing to make literal sense .
But there 's a point , like you see a scale and there 's a meter , and when it 's at 10 , you know that people are going to like it in the sense that they will draw from it and make their own conclusion .
And there 's a whole spectrum to be viewed and to be really conscious of that you 're not just throwing stuff out there and hoping it sticks .
Sometimes when you write a song it makes no sense whatsoever literally , but that meter goes up .
And you know that everybody 's going to go , Wow , that 's really mysterious and I really feel it , or they 'll draw some of their own conclusions from it .
And that 's that song . ''
Like `` Send Me On My Way , '' Rusted Root included this song on their 1992 debut album Cruel Sun , but put a new version on their second album , When I Woke .
Michael Glabicki explained : `` on the version on When I Woke , we decided to come up with different first lyrics , so everybody in the band just started throwing stuff around .
And I remember a couple of books that people were reading , and people came up with some images from those books , and other people threw in other images , and we came up with those lyrics .
That 's one song that I did n't write completely . ''
