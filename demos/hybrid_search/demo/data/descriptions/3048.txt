You know how at the end of the movie Grease Olivia Newton-John transforms from a chaste good girl into a leather-clad vixen ?
She was definitely in vixen mode for this song , which if you are at all paying attention to the lyrics , is blatantly about sex : `` There 's nothin ' left to talk about unless it 's horizontally .
`` Olivia 's real life image was far more modest than what she portrays in this song , and she was concerned about how she would be perceived .
Her managers talked her into recording it , as they knew they had a huge hit on their hands .
The song was released about a month after MTV went on the air , so the video got a lot of spins on the new channel .
In the clip , Newton-John is shown teasing fat men as they try to exercise in some kind of locker room/gym .
The whole idea of the video as to distract from the fact that the song is about sex , and fat guys working out accomplished that goal.Aerobics was just gaining popularity when the song came out , and the video jumped on the trend and included some scenes where Olivia leads a cardio routine the guys ca n't handle .
Eventually , the fat guys are replaced by fit , muscular men who ignore Olivia and pair off , indicating that they are gay .
Despite the lascivious themes , the video was a huge commercial and critical hit - it won the Grammy for Video Of The Year back when that was a real category .
A few radio stations in conservative communities -LRB- including Salt Lake City , Utah -RRB- refused to play this song because of its veiled sexual content .
This just added to the song 's popularity and did n't hurt Olivia 's reputation as one of the least offensive women in music .
The video was directed by Brian Grant , whose experience was mostly on British TV shows .
It was his idea to make fun of the overtly sexual lyrics by setting the video in a gym , and the gay reveal at the end -LRB- long before `` Call Me Maybe '' -RRB- , was also his idea .
The choreographer on the shoot was Kenny Ortega , who had worked with Newton-John on the movie Xanadu .
In 1999 remixed versions of the song , -LRB- titled `` Physical ' 99 : Single Edit , '' `` Neutron Bomb Mix , '' `` Mustard Deep Dub , '' & `` Mustard Full Vocal '' -RRB- with different vocals and an added vocal bridge , were to be released in the UK , but the single was pulled at the last minute .
This was used in a Tropicana Light advertisement that featured oranges exercising .
-LRB- thanks , Tiffany - Dover , FL -RRB- Songwriters Steve Kipner and Terry Shaddick came up with this song , which was originally titled `` Let 's Get Physical . ''
Instead of writing about the emotions of love , they decided to write this about the physical side , which many listeners found very refreshing in a pop song .
Other songs Kipner helped write include `` Hard Habit To Break '' by Chicago and `` Genie in a Bottle '' by Christina Aguilera .
This was a # 1 hit in the US for an amazing 10 weeks .
The only song to that point that stayed at # 1 longer was Elvis Presley 's `` Hound Dog . ''
In America , it was the best-selling single of the '80s .
For 9 of the 10 weeks that this song topped the charts , `` Waiting For A Girl Like You '' by Foreigner was the runner-up .
When `` Physical '' did finally fall , it was replaced at # 1 by `` I Ca n't Go For That -LRB- No Can Do -RRB- '' by Hall & Oates .
The # 2 song that week : `` Waiting For A Girl Like You '' for the 10th consecutive week .
After this was released , Newton-John appeared on a US TV special called Olivia Newton-John : Let 's Get Physical , which featured this and other songs from her album , along with little skits where we got to know her better .
Olivia did a great job of using her acting talents to promote her music , and these TV specials got a huge audience in the days when there were n't a lot of viewing options .
A slow and sultry version was recorded by Kylie Minogue for the movie Moulin Rouge , but it was cut by director Baz Luhrmann .
Minogue as the Green Fairy was to have performed this song in the movie .
-LRB- thanks , Ross - Brisbane , Australia -RRB- On her Fall 2002 `` Heartstrings Tour , '' Olivia performed an unplugged/Bosa-Nova style version of this that was a true crowd pleaser .
Due to popular demand by her fans , Olivia recorded this version of the song and included it as an unlisted `` bonus '' track on her Australian duets album -LRB- Nov 2002 -RRB- called 2 .
-LRB- thanks , James - Minneapolis , MN , for above 2 -RRB- In a survey by Billboard magazine based on each song 's performance on the Hot 100 chart , this was named the # 1 Sexiest Song Of All Time .
The runner-up was Rod Stewart 's `` Tonight 's The Night , '' followed by Boyz II Men 's `` I 'll Make Love To You '' in third place .
