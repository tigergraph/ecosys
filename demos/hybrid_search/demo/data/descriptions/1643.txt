This is the title track from the fourth album of Brooklyn electronica duo Shy Child , who are Pete Cafarella -LRB- vocals and synthesizers -RRB- and Nate Smith -LRB- drums -RRB- .
Cafarella explained to The Sun March 26 , 2010 : `` The song and album are born from an emotional Chinese finger trap .
The fluidity of likes and dislikes , the meeting of minds , the lovechild of good and evil .
We can love our friends and family and significant others but also want to throw empty plastic bottles at them . ''
