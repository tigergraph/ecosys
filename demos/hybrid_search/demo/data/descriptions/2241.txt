This was the first song that the Fleet Foxes ' principal songwriter Robin Pecknold wrote that showcased the band 's celestial four-part harmonies .
He explained to the London Times June 20th 2008 : `` Prior to that , there were a few songs we were working on that were very much focused on the lead vocal , you know ?
And I wanted to do a song that was the extreme opposite of that - where the vocals were just part of the music , and not just a platform for this guy . ''
The painting on the album cover is Netherlandish Proverbs by Pieter Bruegel the Elder -LRB- 1525-1569 -RRB- .
This humorous portrait of peasant life depicts around 100 literal renditions of Flemish proverbs of the day .
Robin Pecknold explained to Q magazine August 2008 why they chose this particular piece of art for the album cover : `` I like it because it 's very bucolic and pretty at first glance , but there 's all this weird stuff going on-fires , people defecating coins , guys shearing pigs , dogs playing cards with chickens .
It gets more disturbing the more you look at it - a pretty good analogy for our music . ''
