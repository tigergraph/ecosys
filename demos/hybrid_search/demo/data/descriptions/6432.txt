Co-writer Jason Evigan considers this song to be Demi 's answer to Miley Cyrus ' hit tune `` Party in the U.S.A. . ''
He told MTV News , `` It 's like our love was made in the USA .
It sounds kind of cheesy but it could be the biggest song of the year because it 's that ` Party in the USA ' kind of vibe like love song . ''
Jason Evigan originally wrote the song for the R&B singer Blair Perkins , but when Demi 's A&R rep , Mio Vukovic , heard the tune he knew it would be right for the former Disney actress .
So they tweaked the production , throwing some guitar onto the mix .
`` It was -LSB- always up-tempo -RSB- , but it was 808s and trap drums and sounded almost like a young Chris Brown record , '' Evigan told MTV News .
`` It 's funny because if you listen to it , if you put a swag on it , it actually has a pretty R&B feel to it .
Now -RSB- it 's got like a country vibe mixed with this R&B feel , which makes it kind of pop country rock thing . ''
The demo was played to Lovato and she loved it .
The pair then started crafting patriotic lyrics together .
`` These American romantic love stories -LSB- inspired it -RSB- and I feel like they 're unbreakable through the years , through time , since the 30s and 40s and 50s , they still hold up , '' said Evigan .
`` Real love , if it 's made in the USA , it 's never gon na break , '' Evigan explained .
`` She recorded it and had some really good changes on it , '' he added .
`` She had some good ideas , just some lyrical ideas .
If it was n't for Mio having phenomenal ears , he really heard through the R&B production that this can be a big pop song and he was right .
It 's crazy how it all turned out that way . ''
The updates were inspired by Lovato 's real-life experiences , making it a personal track for the singer .
`` This song is 100 per cent real to Demi now , '' said Evigan .
`` During the session , I ca n't say what , there was definitely some talk going on .
She was talking about how this relates to her life in certain ways , all about her love being made in the USA .
She owned it .
She freestyled it out and made it awesome . ''
The song was released as the second single from Demi on July 2 , 2013 .
`` It 's no coincidence that it 's being released before Fourth of July , '' Lovato told Good Morning America .
`` I 'm proud .
I know it sounds really cheesy , but I 'm proud to be an American .
And I 'm really proud of my country and how far we 've come . ''
She added : `` It 's a great love song .
It 's basically about falling in love in the best country ever . ''
Lovato co-directed the music video with Ryan Pallota .
Friday Night Lights actress Aimee Teegarden and 90210 actor Dustin Milligan star as a couple who meet at a carnival , fall in love and are forced to deal with Milligan 's military deployment overseas .
Speaking about how she got involved in the directing process , Lovato stated : `` I saw the shots that I wanted to do and everything .
I told my manager and I kind of walked him through it , step-by-step .
And he said , ` why do n't you just direct it since you know what you want ? '
and I 've always wanted to direct so I was like , ` OK , let 's do it ! '
And that 's kind of how it happened . ''
Lovato told MTV that scenes when Milligan 's character is sent off to war was one of her favorites to shoot .
`` When he was fighting in Afghanistan , the shots are really close up on his face , and he is hiding behind something , and he is fully loaded , and he 's in the middle of a war , and it was really great , '' she said .
`` Dustin is such a good actor , and he was crying , and there were bombs going off and everything .
That was just the coolest scene because that scene looks like it 's from a movie , so I was really excited . ''
