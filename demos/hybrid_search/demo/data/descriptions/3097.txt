This campfire sing-along accompanied by a strummed ukulele , is the title track of New York based indie pop singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson 's 4th studio album .
This song announces the record 's simple truth : `` Everybody needs to love / Everybody wants to be loved . ''
Michaelson explained to Paste Magazine that so universal are these `` matters of the heart , '' that they ca n't be claimed .
Everybody is truly everybody 's - hence the album title .
The album chronicles an intense and volatile relationship in which both lovers lose themselves within it and must disengage .
Michaelson told Paste Magazine : `` It 's completely autobiographical , snapshots of my life . ''
After pausing she added : `` Beyonc√© sings songs that are n't true or real .
She had to employ an alter ego in Sasha Fierce .
But I ai n't got no Jay-Z in my life .
I have veggie burritos .
I 'm just me on stage . ''
