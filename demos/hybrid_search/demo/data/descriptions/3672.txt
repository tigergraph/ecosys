Shelton had this ballad in his back pocket for a few years before finally recording it for his Red River Blue album .
He explained to The Boot : `` We were pitched the song a couple albums ago , but the only reason I have n't cut it is a fear of whether I could perform that vocal or not .
It 's a hard song to sing .
Once we got in there and cut it , I realized I can be comfortable with this . ''
Martina McBride provides harmonies on the track .
Shelton recalled to The Boot , he originally chickened out of asking the Country star directly : `` I sent John -LSB- McBride -RSB- and Martina 's daughter , Delaney , a text that said , ` Do you think your mom would sing on my record with me ? ' ''
he remembered .
`` She said , ` Too bad you do n't have the nerve to ask her yourself ! '
She pop-smarted something off to me !
-LSB- laughs -RSB- `` So Blake asked Martina personally and she obliged .
`` The record would not be half the record it is without her voice on it , '' he said .
