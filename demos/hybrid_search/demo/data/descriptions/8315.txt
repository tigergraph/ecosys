As he was preparing for We Walk This Road , Robert Randolph and his producer T-Bone Burnett were working on an update of this song by early bluesman Blind Willie Johnson .
At first , the results proved to be unsatisfactory .
However , they eventually turned things around with the help of guitarist Ben Harper who played six string and sung on the track .
Randolph recalled to Artist Direct : `` T-Bone had this vision for these songs where he thought everyone should come in and jam on them .
We did n't know where they would go , but maybe something would happen .
Maybe somebody will say something or play something that will take us somewhere and just use everything around us as inspiration .
So , we 'd get in there and start jamming , playing , singing , writing lyrics , but what we had at the time -LSB- for this song -RSB- just was n't good enough for any of us .
I just decided I was beat down and wanted to walk away from the song for awhile.Four months later , I 'm texting Ben Harper , ` Hey why do n't you come down to the studio ?
We 're just hanging out and making music . '
So Ben comes down and asks to hear something .
I played him ` If I Had My Way ' and his eyes just lit up like a kid in a candy store .
He ran into the vocal booth and just starting singing those lyrics ; making them up right there .
We thought , ` Wow !
Now we 've got something to write to .
Let 's do this thing . '
It just turned into such a great event .
You 're not the only one that likes that one .
It 's everybody 's favorite .
That 's why we decided to release that one first .
That song really tells the story of the record .
When you 're talking about the first day I talked to T-Bone about how we could make this record special , this song has Jim Keltner -LSB- Bob Dylan -RSB- playing drums , my sister and cousins singing , Ben Harper singing and T-Bone playing guitar .
It 's just a story , you know ? ''
