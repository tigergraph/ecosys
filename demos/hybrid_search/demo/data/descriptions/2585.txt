This ballad is the second single from American R&B singer Keyshia Cole 's fourth studio album , Calling All Hearts .
The singer titled the long player after becoming romantically involved with Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Daniel Gibson .
`` I recorded half the album before I met my fianc√© , and so I was not really that optimistic about finding true love , '' Cole explained to MTV News .
`` And then after we met , I finished the record , which created a whole ` nother outlook on life , '' she laughed .
`` So that 's why I named it Calling All Hearts because I feel like it was both sides : heartbreak and the happiness of the heart . ''
Daniel Gibson made a cameo appearance in the song 's music video .
The song was mainly penned by production team J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League with Cole writing the bridge .
She told MTV News about this tune concerning a female recovering from a bruised relationship : `` I thought that it was a great perspective , as women , and as people who have been hurt before , been hurt by the person that you love the most in your life , it can really do something to your character , to your soul , the person that you become .
And I felt like with a new love , sometimes we have to , not to say completely forget , but forgive and move on and allow that new love to come in your life and to make you happy and change your whole perspective on love after you 've been scorned . ''
