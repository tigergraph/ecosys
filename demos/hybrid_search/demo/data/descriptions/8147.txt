Three former Guns N ' Roses members appear on this track and helped write it .
In addition to Slash , drummer Matt Sorum and guitarist Gilby Clarke appear on this track and helped write it .
All three were members of Guns N ' Roses , although Clarke had been ejected from G 'N' R by the time the album was released .
According to Clarke , the song was conceived at a time when the three were writing songs for what they thought would be the next Guns N ' Roses album , but when that did n't materialize , they used some of this material for the Slash 's Snakepit project .
In our interview with Gilby Clarke , he explained : `` I was getting riffs ready for another Guns N ' Roses record ; just compiling riffs .
I played Slash the main riff of ` Dime Store Rock ' and he liked it , so we collaborated - that was Matt and Eric Dover on that track .
So it was just a matter of hearing a cool riff that we got together and saying , ` Hey , this is what I 'm going to play , what do you want to add to it ? '
And that 's how that kind of progressed into the song that it came to be . ''
Eric Dover was the lead singer in Slash 's Snakepit , and is also credited as a co-writer .
The other co-writer was Mike Inez , who was the group 's bass player .
