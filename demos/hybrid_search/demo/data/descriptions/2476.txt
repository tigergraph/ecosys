Love is the `` bitch , '' not any specific woman .
Mick Jagger had many relationships he could base this on , including his breakup with Marianne Faithfull .
He broke up with her after she tried to commit suicide while they were in Australia in late 1969 -LRB- Mick was filming Ned Kelly -RRB- .
As soon as Marianne recovered , Mick dumped her .
Released as a single , this did not chart , probably because it was banned from many radio stations for its sexual content and outrageous title .
The album cover was designed by Andy Warhol .
It was a close-up photo of a man in a pair of jeans complete with an actual zipper .
The zipper caused problems in shipment because it scratched the record .
They figured out that if they opened the zipper before shipment , it did minimal damage .
The Goo Goo Dolls covered this in 1997 on the compilation album No Alternative .
Keith Richards arrived at the studio after the others had been working on this for a while with little success .
He came up with the guitar riff and made it work .
Along with `` Under My Thumb , '' this did n't help the Stones ' image with women 's groups .
This features Bobby Keys on sax and Jim Price on trumpet .
They provided horns on albums and tours through the early '70s .
The album title Sticky Fingers refers to the aptitude of a person who is likely to steal .
It went well with the lawless image The Stones put forward .
