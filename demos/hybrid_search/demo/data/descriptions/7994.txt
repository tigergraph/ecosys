In this song Browne recalls visiting Cuba and looks at the effects of the economic , commercial , and financial embargo imposed by the United States on Cuba in 1962 .
The Californian singer-songwriter explained to American Songwriter magazine : `` It 's not easy to write a song about foreign policy .
If you know about the politics and the history , the embargo against Cuba - the details - then there 's embracing what 's good about the people , their commitment to having a good time in spite of it all . ''
