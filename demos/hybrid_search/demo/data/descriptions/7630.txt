The title refers to the song structure as it was originally writte : `` A '' , `` B '' , and `` C '' refer to different sections of the song : A = VerseB = ChorusC = BridgeSo the song went verse , chorus , verse , bridge , verse , chorus , but it ended up having a different structure - `` ABACAB '' was just a way for them to remember how it was formed when they started working on it .
When it came time to title the song and the album , they wanted something a bit abstract , and `` Abacab '' worked because it had no meaning .
The album art was created to look like an abstract painting to go with this theme , which indicated that this would not be typical of Genesis ' previous work .
`` It was n't going to be goblins and fairies , '' Mike Rutherford said .
The first Top-10 hit for Genesis in the US .
Collins said that Abacab was the first album where the three members of the band really talked to each other and worked as a team .
The band bought a place in Surrey , England that they turned into a recording studio , which they called `` The Farm . ''
This song was written in the living room of the house .
On this song and the others on the album , the drums were a lot more pronounced than on previous Genesis recordings , and the keyboards far less prominent .
Before a reunited Genesis set out for their 2007 tour , Rolling Stone magazine asked Collins if any songs did n't make it past rehearsal .
His reply : `` That happened with `` Abacab , '' which I 'm sure everyone expects us to do .
Halfway through the first verse , I said , ' I do n't really want to sing this .
I do n't know what it 's about . ' ''
