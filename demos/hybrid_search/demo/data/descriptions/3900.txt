Daft Punk described this spacey instrumental filled with sci-fi effects to French publication Le Nouvel Observateur as , `` A futuristic piece , which could be the year 4000 ... '' `` Motherboard '' is a piece that lends itself far more to a trip-hop/downtempo track , such as that of Bonobo , Morcheeba , Zero 7 , Air , and Emancipator , etc. and moves away from a heavy focus on electronic instruments .
The percussion is particularly atypical of Daft Punk , which is entirely acoustic with less emphasis on the kick drum , lacking the same driving force of EDM percussion and adding to Daft Punk 's new relaxed direction .
The focus on live conventional classical instruments is also unusual for them , though the increasing use of heavy synthesizers over the course of the track -LRB- only heard prominently from the breakdown onwards -RRB- take it firmly back to Daft Punk 's roots by the end of the piece .
