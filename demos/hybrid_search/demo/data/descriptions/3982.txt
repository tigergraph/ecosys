Rihanna sings on this Tricky Stewart and Ester Dean penned electro-ballad about her playful relationship with her lover .
Rihanna explained to MTV News that the song is easily relatable to both sexes , even if she 's singing about a boyfriend who 's hard to read .
`` That song , it 's not a sex thing , '' she explained .
`` It 's not like only women can sing this song or only women can relate to this song , 'cause it 's an individual thing and sometimes , sometimes , men are just too complicated and then again , men can find women complicated .
But it all depends on the individual .
Because not all women think love is complicated and not all men think that , but there are some women and some men who strongly believe that love is just too complicated . ''
