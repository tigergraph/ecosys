This jovial party tune originated with an idea that was started by Trailer Choir 's Marc `` Butter '' Fortney , before Toby Keith and Bobby Pinson joined in .
Keith explained : `` Marc Fortney Trailer Choir was signed to my label for several years and their lead singer Butter -LRB- Fortney -RRB- wanted me to write with them .
I agreed , but they were so busy on that tour doing the outside stage and running around doing promotions that we never could find time in the afternoon .
And when he could find time , I 'd usually have a writer with me .
So I asked if he had anything he wanted to write , and this was one I loved .
Once they were off the tour , he sent out a version that did n't fit what me and Bobby thought it should say .
So we flipped it and wrote one from scratch , then sent it to him to tweak .
Ended up being a little dandy .
If you had a brand new artist who was country , had a smile on his face and could laugh at himself , you could put this one in his first three singles and it might actually break .
It 's just a simple little thing , kind of a throwback , but it 's got that melody you want to sing along with . ''
The song has an old-time , jazzy sound over which multi-instrumentalist Jim Hoke plays an optimistic clarinet melody .
Hoke also contributed harmonica on Keith 's American Ride album and tenor saxophone and trumpet for his That Do n't Make Me a Bad Guy set .
