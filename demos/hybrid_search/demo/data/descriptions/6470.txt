This song features the Southern Blues singer Charles Jones and '70s talk box legend Peter Frampton taking turns with the verses .
Long time Lifehouse collaborator , Jude Cole , said regarding Frampton 's contribution : `` I had the great pleasure of meeting Peter when I worked for Extra some years ago .
We had dinner recently and I asked him to bring his old but newly found '57 Les Paul `` Phoenix '' , -LRB- yes the one from Frampton Comes Alive ! -RRB-
down and be a part of the record .
He completely mesmerized the room as the band and I sat and watched him perform his solo and vocal like he was onstage at the Fillmore .
Together along with Jason 's vocal and the band 's energetic sound , I believe we captured something very special here . ''
