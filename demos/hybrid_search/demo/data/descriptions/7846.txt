Frontman Tyler Glenn described this song to CBS San Francisco as , `` bratty , '' adding that is , `` basically a four minute rant of everything I 'm tired of . ''
Regarding the influences of the song , Glenn said , `` It sounds like something that Iggy Pop and Billy Idol would do if they collaborated with Little Richard and Refused and blended in the Gang of Four . ''
`` I 'm really happy that people saw that I meant it as more of an empowerment and less of a. . .
it 's not an attack or a misuse of the word , '' he concluded .
Glenn admitted in the same interview that he was apprehensive about the lyric : `` I 'm sick of always operating out of fear .
I 'm sick of being called a fag because I 'm queer . ''
He explained : `` I thought of the line not in a sexual way but in fact that I 've been called a fag since I was probably 11 years old for dressing different or listening to different music .
For being me .
I can only imagine how frightening it would be to be gay and be called that relentlessly . ''
