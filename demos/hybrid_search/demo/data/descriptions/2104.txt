Martie Mcguire -LRB- then Martie Siedel -RRB- , wrote this song about her sister and bandmate Emily Robison 's boyfriend , Charlie .
On the VH1 show Storytellers , Martie stated , '' -LSB- Emily -RSB- had been dating a bunch of guys I did n't approve of , and then she met Charlie and I sort of pictured him whisking her off into the sunset . ''
Emily and Charlie eventually married and are still together .
