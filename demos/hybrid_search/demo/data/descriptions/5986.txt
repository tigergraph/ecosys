Band frontman Charlton Parker wrote this song , with no intentions of recording it .
It is based on his own experiences with the unpopular crowd .
According to an interview with the band at Anti-Music , an MTV executive heard the track on Sirius Hits One and immediately licensed it for the show My Super Sweet 16 .
`` Hail to the Geek '' met with similar enthusiasm at The CW Network , which included the song in three episodes of Beauty and the Geek .
