This electro bumping club track is a cut from Cannibal , an EP by American recording artist Ke $ ha .
The disc was released both on its own and bundled with the singer 's Animal , record in a deluxe reissue .
The song was released as the third promotional single on November 12 , 2010 in the run up to the release of the EP .
The song 's music video was directed by Chris Marrs Piliero and co-stars Dawson 's Creek actor James Van Der Beek as Kesha 's nemesis .
During their laser fight in the dance hall , hard-partying unicorns get caught in the crossfire .
Said Van Der Beek to Entertainment Weekly : `` I think the more you try to come up with a logical explanation for it , the more frustrated you 're gon na get .
Just kick back and enjoy .
The credit for anything you like about the video has to go to the director , Chris Marrs .
He came up with the concept , wrote the dialogue , shot it ... '' Vocally the song uses snippets of Ke $ ha 's yodelling , combined with heavy use of auto-tune .
Lyrically it finds the singer and her friends getting ready to party in a crash pad that has `` dirt and glitter '' covering the floor .
Ke $ ha performed this song on the Nickelodeon show Victorious in an episode that aired April 22 , 2011 .
On the show , the main character Tori wins a private concert with Ke $ ha , who performs the song and blasts her with her trademark glitter .
