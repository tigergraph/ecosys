Producer Tony Visconti told Rolling Stone about this multi-layered celebration of dance .
`` That 's a very uptempo one , '' he said .
`` It 's got a Motown beat to it , but the rest of it is completely psychedelic .
It 's got very floaty vibe .
There 's a guy called David Torn who plays guitar , who we use ; he comes with huge amounts of equipment that he creates these aural landscapes .
He uses them in a rock context with all that ambient sound , and he 's bending his tremolo arm and all that .
It 's just crazy , completely crazy sound on that track . ''
Bowie slips in a reference to Georges Rodenbach when he sings : `` Silent as Georges Rodenbach .
Mist and silhouette .
`` Georges Rodenbach -LRB- 1855 - 1898 -RRB- was a Belgian Symbolist poet and novelist , who stated that silence was the thread connecting all of his work .
He once wrote a poem titled Le r√®gne du silence .
