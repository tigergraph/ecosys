This song was inspired by the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings and in particular the revolution in Egypt .
Candlebox mainman Kevin Martin explained to Artist Direct : `` I happened to be in Lancaster , PA working with The Gracious Few and I was overwhelmed by those 48 hours of television showing uprising .
The song came to me from that . ''
