Metronomy frontman Joe Mount told NME that this was the first song he wrote that had `` more than four or so words in it . ''
He added : `` When I wrote it I was living in a Brighton bedsit .
Bedsits are great places for steering up all kinds of emotions .
I think I stole the ' I want to get more from this ' from Roxy Music 's ` More Than This . ' ''
