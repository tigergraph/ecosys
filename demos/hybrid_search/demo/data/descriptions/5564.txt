Cazzettte are a Swedish EDM duo comprising Alexander Bj√∂rklund and Sebastian Furrer .
They first heated up as a result of their remixes for the likes of David Guetta and Avicii , before this song became their first Billboard chart entry when it debuted on Dance/Mix Show Airplay .
The phrase ` Beam me up ' meaning ` Get me out of this ' originated on US campuses in the 1960s .
The phrase quotes Captain 's Kirk 's request to the chief engineer , `` Beam me up , Scotty '' in Star Trek , to activate a beam that can return him from a planet to the starship Enterprise .
According to Brewer 's Dictionary of Modern Phrase and Fable , he never actually says this , his nearest equivalent words being `` Beam us up , Mr Scott . ''
The duo made history on November 12 , 2012 when they released their debut EP Eject via Spotify , marking the first-ever debut exclusively on the streaming site .
