This song deals with drugs and fame : `` Take it off , and shoot it up , and tell me how used to fly , everyone around you superstar , they can motherf -- king die . ''
Perhaps the stripping needs to be done to gain more drugs , to continue being famous , or is in fact another way of saying the drug use and fame already strip the person down .
