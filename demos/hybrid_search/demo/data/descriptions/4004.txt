This is the opening track from rap metal act Hollywood Undead 's CD/DVD Desperate Measures .
Desperate Measures includes three new songs , three covers , a remix of `` Everywhere I Go '' , and six live versions of previously released tracks along with a DVD containing live performances .
J-Dog explained to Artist Direct why they decided to bring the record out : `` We really wanted to come out with some new material .
Our album came out a year ago , and it 's just fun to record new songs .
We 've been playing the same songs for a year straight , and it 's nice to have new songs to play during the live set .
We 've been playing the same set for about a year , and it feels great to have some new material . ''
Keyboardist J-Dog told Artist Direct about the song : `` It 's a f -- king cool song !
That 's -LRB- producer -RRB- Danny Lohner right there .
It sounds like a Nine Inch Nails song .
Danny produced it and collaborated with us , and he definitely was a big influence on the track .
It 's a really heavy and in-your-face song .
The instrumental on this song is amazing .
I 'd love to do more songs like it .
If you listen to the lyrics , they come from the viewpoint of attacking something -- people talking s -- t or whatever you want to call it . ''
