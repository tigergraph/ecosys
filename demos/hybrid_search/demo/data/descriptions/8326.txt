This fiddle-driven anthem was produced by Jon Randall Stewart and features American Country recording artists Miranda Lambert and Jamey Johnson .
Bentley explained the collaboration to The Boot .
He said : `` When Jon threw ` Bad Angel ' at me , I thought about who would be my contemporary if I did it .
So I just called up Miranda and Jamey and they both listened and said they wanted to do it and we made it happen .
Nothing was orchestrated or planned .
Miranda 's voice on that song - she does it so different and cool .
And Jamey is so great , the song just turned out great . ''
