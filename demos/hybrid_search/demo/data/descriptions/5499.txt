This is the first single by acoustic rock band , Secondhand Serenade , from their third studio album , Hear Me Now .
The song was debuted on May 17 , 2010 on Kid Kraddick 's nationally syndicated radio show .
Though Aaron Johnson -LRB- The Fray -RRB- produced the majority of Hear Me Now in Los Angeles , Vesely , helped by Secondhand Serenade drummer Tom Breyfogle , took charge of this single along with two other tracks .
Vesely explained to Billboard magazine that was out of necessity .
`` The label was telling me that we needed more songs for the album , that we were n't quite done , and I was worried my album was never going to come out , '' he recalled .
`` I just sat at the piano and started writing the song ; it was a lot different than any of the other songs I 'd written , and it became the first single .
`` Vesely added he `` really enjoyed '' helming a few songs .
`` It was something I 've always wanted to do and finally had the confidence to go out and do it , '' he said .
`` Some of my favorite songs are the ones I produced myself .
It was a really great experience for me . ''
The song was produced by Secondhand Serenade singer/songwriter John Vesely along with drummer Tom Breyfogle at Vesely 's home studio and mixed by Mark Endert -LRB- Train , Maroon 5 -RRB- .
