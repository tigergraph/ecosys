There have been several songs with the phrase `` Teenage Idol '' in the title .
This Elton John/Bernie Taupin composition should more properly be called `` I 'm Gon na Be A Teenage Idol , '' because that verbatim phrase is part of the lyric .
Produced by Gus Dudgeon , it was recorded along with the rest of the album at Strawberry Studios , Ch√¢teau D'Hierouville , France in June 1972 .
For Elton , the song 's title turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophesy in the nicest possible way , because the front page of the March 31 issue of Melody Maker the following year pictured him playing to a sell out crowd of mainly youngsters in London ; its headline was NOW ELTON 'S A TEEN IDOL !
