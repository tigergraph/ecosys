In this song Jones explains that no matter how long she waits , `` it does n't mean you 'll return . ''
In 2008 Jones split with her boyfriend Lee Alexander , who was the bassist in her backing band .
Though Jones refused to confirm in an interview with Mojo magazine December 2009 that this song is about Alexander , she admitted that loneliness has proved to be a great songwriting spur .
`` I 'm not the kind of person to write five songs a week , '' she said .
`` It 's more like five songs a year .
But I do know that I write best when I 'm unhappy .
I 'm usually lonely , or at least alone a lot , when the words start coming .
The material is kind of dark even though I 'm not a dark person .
It 's certainly not happy . ''
Jones commented to Mojo on the hopeless longing captured in this song : `` It 's the most pathetic feeling in the world .
It 's probably how your dog feels when you go out of the door .
We 've all had that feeling , right ? ''
