Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs add harmonies to this six-minute track .
Lucinda Williams told Uncut magazine : `` I did n't know Matthew Sweet or Susanna Hoffs , Tom -LSB- Overby , co-producer and fianc√© -RSB- came up with the idea of Matthew , and Matthew brought Susanna .
He did these amazing arrangements , and she sounded like an angel .
Matthew is like the Brian Wilson of today -- a genius . ''
Williams told Rolling Stone magazine that this was inspired by an article on Pete Doherty in one of their previous issues .
She explained : `` It 's an empathetic look at self-indulgent , little-brat rock stars .
He 's great , and you want to say , ` Snap out of it ! ' ''
