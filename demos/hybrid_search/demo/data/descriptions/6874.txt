This song was produced by Grammy winning record producer and three-time world champion DJ Infamous .
McCoy told Alternative Press : `` He played it for me and I was like , ` Whoa , this is perfect .
I know exactly what I 'm going to do with this song .
Just dig in the vaults for all the nostalgic stuff and all the things I miss from being a kid . ' ''
McCoy explained the song : '' ` Akidagain ' is kind of self-explanatory .
It 's broken down into three parts : One when I was young , one when I was a little bit older and then one where I 'm at now , reflecting on when I was a kid .
It just talks about all the crazy stuff that goes on when you 're a kid -- smashing windows and running from the cops , things like that .
Then you get to the third verse , and it 's reflecting on that and missing it .
`` We did an interpretation of a mod song from back in the day .
We had the Betty White Kids Choir sing it .
You ca n't really lose with kids on an album .
