This song was written as a tribute to the lead singer of Alice In Chains , Layne Staley .
Layne passed away the same day Staind lead singer Aaron Lewis ' daughter Zoe Jane was born .
Alice In Chains was a big influence on Staind .
Aaron felt that Layne 's death was portrayed as a typical junkie rock and roll death .
He thought Layne 's life was never given a proper tribute to his life , and his influence on rock and roll still lives today .
This song is an attempt to keep his memory alive .
Layne died on April 5 , 2002 .
Eight years earlier on the same day , Kurt Cobain died .
Both were addicted to drugs , but Kurt also used drugs to forget his stomach pains .
R.I.P. Kurt and Layne .
