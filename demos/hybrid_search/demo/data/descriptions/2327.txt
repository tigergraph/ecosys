Written on New Year 's Eve of 1995 by lead singer and backup guitarist John Feldmann , this song was Goldfinger 's first major single to gain a large mainstream following .
It marked their departure from an underground Punkish band into Pop/Punk semi-stardom -LRB- they were still relatively unknown -RRB- .
The song still remains one of the most popular songs in their live lineups even after over a decade of playing it .
