This is a cover of a tune originally recorded by American Blues guitarist Elmore James , who was known as `` The King of the Slide Guitar . ''
The song was released posthumously as a single two years after his death in 1963 .
The song is included on Hendrix 's 2010 posthumous album , Valleys of Neptune .
Long-time Hendrix studio engineer and friend Eddie Kramer commented to Toronto 's The Globe and Mail March 5 , 2010 : `` It 's certainly a nice little jaunt for Jimi .
Any time he felt he could take off in wild direction , within reason , he would do it -- not so much to prove a point , but to stretch the boundaries . ''
Hendrix did a different recording of the song a month later with Cox and drummer Buddy Miles .
Before they began , Jimi instructed the pair that he wanted to establish a totally different beat than the standard arrangement .
That version can be heard on Hendrix 's posthumous album , People , Hell & Angels .
This angry Blues number was recorded by Hendrix at New York 's Record Plant , on April 24 , 1969 .
It was one of the guitar hero 's first sessions with bassist Billy Cox , an old army buddy he 'd recruited into his new ensemble .
The track also features Rocky Isaac on drums , Chris Grimes on tambourine and Al Marks on maracas .
A music video was filmed by Julien Temple to accompany the song 's single release .
Temple 's résumé includes work with talents such as The Rolling Stones , Sex Pistols , David Bowie , Kinks , Neil Young , Tom Petty and Janet Jackson , as well as such feature films as The Great Rock 'N' Roll Swindle , The Rolling Stones Live at The Max and The Filth & The Fury .
