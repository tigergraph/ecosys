Cocker told the New Musical Express the background to this song : `` For about ten minutes I thought I 'd lost my son at St. Pancras Station .
Of all the places to lose a kid an international train station is probably the worst you could pick .
Immediately you imagine that they 're being put on a train to some weird place on the continent .
It was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life . ''
