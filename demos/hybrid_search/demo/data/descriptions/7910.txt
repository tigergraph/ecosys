According to Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucci , who produced A Dramatic Turn Of Events , this is a `` total riff factory . ''
He told Musicradar.com : `` One of the challenges that I like to present myself with on a song like this is to try to make each riff original and unique and have them weave in and out of different syncopations .
As they go by , no pass is ever the same ; they 're constantly changing.Doing this can be tricky , because it makes everything harder to play and difficult to remember .
But I think that 's ultimately what makes the song original and interesting - putting that kind of thought into it . ''
This song was originally titled `` The Shaman 's Trance . ''
Its title was changed after the lyrics were written .
American drummer Mike Mangini was one of seven auditioned to replace Mike Portnoy in Dream Theater at the end of 2010 .
He was officially announced on April 29 , 2011 as the band 's new drummer and this song showcases the sticksman 's skills .
Petrucci told Music Radar : `` The cool thing about Mike Mangini is he 's very aware musically of whatever everybody 's doing .
He matches things so effortlessly .
Even if it sounds like a groove is going by , he catches little rhythmic elements with his kick drums , or he 'll match fills that go in the same direction as the guitar .
And he 's constantly changing things up as well .
Seeing and hearing him work his magic is incredible.Actually , right at the end is one of the sickest drum parts I 've ever heard .
It 's like a machine gun , the intensity .
When he would play it , I would be watching and listening to him , and I was in awe .
` How is this even happening ? '
I said to myself .
` How is a human being doing this ? '
He 's remarkable . ''
