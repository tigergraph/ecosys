This is the opening track of Stone Sour 's fifth studio album House of Gold & Bones Part 2 , the second part of the band 's double-record concept record .
The two records center on a man struggling to find his place in the world , and this song finds Corey Taylor singing in the voice of his main character , surveying the emotional wreckage around him .
He explained in a video feature with Music Feeds that this lead off song sets the tone musically for the rest of the album .
He explained , `` Part 2 is very rich , very orchestral and it 's very complex .
Musically , it 's probably the most diverse music that we 've ever done . ''
The two House Of Gold And Bones records tell the story of a character called The Human who wakes up in a mysterious world , where he comes across various characters .
He is instructed to make his way toward a crimson city called Red City and find the House of Gold and Bones before an event called the Conflagration takes place .
Taylor explained in a video track by track that as ` Part 2 ' begins as The Human finds himself in the clutches of the Numbers and Black John , seeking to find the answers of what 's going on in his world .
Stone Sour guitarist Josh Rand explained the writing and recording process for the two House Of Gold & Bones records to Ultimate-Guitar .
com : `` All of us write individually , '' he said , `` and then when it 's time to do a new Stone Sour record we bring in what we 've all written and then it becomes a Stone Sour song .
Everybody puts their little spin on things .
Corey writes the lyrics after the music has been laid out .
Recording-wise this time around , we all just spent like two weeks in Des Moines , the four of us , just doing pre-production and then went to a cow farm in Jamaica , Iowa and spent three months to record both records . ''
