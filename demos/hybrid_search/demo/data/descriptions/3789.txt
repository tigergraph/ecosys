This is the title track of American Rock band Shinedown 's fourth studio album .
It is named after a flower native to South Africa that grows in desolate environments flowering in adversity .
Drummer Barry Kerch explained his interpretation of the song to Alternative Addiction : `` It 's about the rebirth of this band , Brent -LRB- Smith vocalist & lyricist -RRB- 's meaning might differ slightly in that it contains the thoughts about his girlfriend who helped him through a difficult time but those two things kind of happened at the same time and it really encompasses the band .
