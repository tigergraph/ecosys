The lead single from Peace 's debut studio album was written by the band 's front-man Harrison Koisser , and produced by Jim Abiss -LRB- Arctic Monkeys , Adele -RRB- .
The track was released in the United Kingdom on January 13 , 2013 .
Harry Koisser told NME : '' ` Wraith ' used to just be a loop of the riff that I shouted stuff over but then we added a chorus when we recorded the demo , It 's probably the oldest song on the album . ''
Ready to be confused ? ''
` Wraith ' is about falling in love with a prostitute , '' said Koisser in publicity materials , `` but not really a prostitute and not really falling in love . ''
