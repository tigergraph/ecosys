This song , as with much of Five For Fighting 's material , deals with mortality .
However , on the official site of the band , primary member and songwriter , John Ondrasik states that while our fallibility is an underlying theme in the song , it is ultimately a love song from a father to his son .
Ondrasik claims he took two and a half years to write it .
The video for the song retains its theme of paternity , as it features Ondrasik driving a blue Mustang that his father gave him .
