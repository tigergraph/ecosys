This was inspired by guitarist Danny Jones ' father walking out on his mother in 2004 .
Jones has n't seen his father since .
He told the Mail On Sunday : `` I hate thinking about it .
My dad went off with another woman .
It was a weak midlife crisis thing - he just left us .
I think he 's a prat and I 'd never do what he did .
In the end I had to pay him off .
I do n't want to see him again .
I guess it could be the excuse for me to go off the rails .
-LRB- Bass player -RRB- Dougie -LRB- Poynter -RRB- went through the same thing , but then , why would you want to get into drugs and become a hopeless excuse for a human being just because someone else is ? ''
