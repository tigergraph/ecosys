On this dis track , 50 Cent calls Young Buck a drug addict and addresses his feud with The Game .
50 told MTV News about the lyric : `` I said , ' I gave Game hits , he told me to suck di -- / Start screamin ' Westside and Dre ai n't say sh -- ! ' ''
`` It was an absolute true statement and Dre approved because it was true , '' 50 said .
`` He heard the record and was like , ` Whoa !
Out the park with that . '
He likes it , he does n't care .
Creatively , you 're right , 'cause he did n't say anything when that took place - or not anything that the public heard . ''
