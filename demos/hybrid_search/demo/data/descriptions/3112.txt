`` Word Up '' is a saying that was popular in New York and other urban areas in the US that acted as an affirmation of what was said , kind of a hipper `` You Bet . ''
Cameo developed a character around the saying and wrote the lyrics about what he would say .
They called the character `` Vicious '' and had him take out his frustrations on rappers who delve into psychodrama when they should be creating music you can dance to : `` Give us music , we can that , we need to dance .
We do n't need that type of psychological romance . ''
Cameo leader Larry Blackmon got the idea for the guttural vocal from Sly Stone , who is one of his heroes .
In the movie The 40-year-old virgin , Steve Carell sings a karaoke version of this alone in his apartment .
Cameo was a popular Funk band in the '70s and '80s .
This hit fused their Funk background with elements of rap , giving them a big hit .
Korn and Melanie Brown have both recorded this .
It was also part of a popular mash-up with Gwen Stefani 's `` Hollaback Girl . ''
