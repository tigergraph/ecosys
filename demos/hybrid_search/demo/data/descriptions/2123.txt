This was the first single from Branch 's debut album .
Her label , Maverick Records , faced the challenge of promoting the song even though Branch was unknown .
Instead of begging radio stations to play it , they paid AOL to feature it on their music channel , where it was very well received .
This led to play on MTV 's Total Request Live , and the song took off from there .
Another famous connection is the drummer , who has worked with John Mellencamp , Smashing Pumpkins , and Ricky Martin .
His name is Kenny Aronoff , and he broke his bass drum pedal for the first time ever while recording this .
According to an AOL exclusive interview , Branch made up the story in the song for her first album when she had little creative control .
She wrote it just to have a song to promote .
-LRB- thanks , MsZacEfron - Chicago , IL -RRB- The engineer on the album is Grotus drummer Lars Fox .
His claim to fame is being the DJ in the video for `` AM Radio '' by Everclear , in addition to working on their albums .
While he appears to have hair in the video , it is fake .
Lars is really bald .
This won the Viewer 's Choice award at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards .
