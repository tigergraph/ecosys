This dark , mysterious track was released as the first single from Alice in Chains ' fifth studio album and hit # 1 on the Rock Radio charts .
Singer-guitarist Jerry Cantrell told Rolling Stone that he was pleasantly surprised by the song 's immediate acceptance .
`` We just put that song out there for the fans and then it ended up turning into a number one single , a six-minute sludgy metal tune , '' he said .
`` That 's always fun , to see something like that happen . ''
This was the first riff that singer-guitarist Jerry Cantrell came up with for The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here .
He recalled to Grammy.com : `` I was warming up in the room in Vegas , our very last show of the tour , and I remember our manager , Beno , was in the room and they were sitting there talking and they were worried about me because I was pretty close to having pneumonia .
I was so ill .
I started playing that riff and I recorded that riff .
I saw Nick -LRB- Raskulinecz , producer -RRB- bobbing his head .
I dug it too , so I recorded it .
That 's actually the first riff that happened . ''
The sci-fi themed video was filmed by director Roboshobo -LRB- Metallica , Mastodon , Green Day -RRB- .
