The fastest dog , the greyhound , can reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour .
The breed was well-respected and well-known throughout the ancient world and many civilizations fostered the breeding of this dog .
The greyhound breed was known before the ninth century in England , where aristocrats bred them to hunt such small game as hares.King Henry VIII of England organised a couple of greyhound dog races at Eltham Palace in 1532 and lost them both.Queen Elizabeth 1st abolished the law that only noblemen could hunt with greyhounds .
Until then , going to the dogs had only been an upper class activity in England.A promoter named Owen Patrick Smith first tested modern dog racing at a track in Tucson , Arizona in 1909 .
By 1919 Smith had perfected the mechanical rabbit , and he successfully demonstrated it at Emeryville , California .
The canine-inspired music video is the product of a collaboration between the Swedish House Mafia trio and Absolut Vodka .
Set in a futuristic desert , the visual follows gangs racing robotic greyhounds .
With Absolut making the song the soundtrack to their latest advertising campaign , the clip doubles up as the TV and cinema commercials for the drink .
The national TV advert for the track was the most Shazam-ed commercial of 2012 .
