This is a track from Flamingo , the first solo album by The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers .
The title refers to the iconic sign that greets travelers driving into Flowers ' hometown of Las Vegas .
He explained to Spin magazine : `` People would dodge cars to take a picture by it , so the city finally made a parking lot by it .
It 's that combination of being so happy while dumping all their money .
It 's definitely not a perfect town , so that was the perfect place to jump from . ''
Flowers explained the album title to The NME : `` The Flamingo is one of the most famous casinos on the -LRB- Las Vegas -RRB- strip , and also one of the first-it was infamously opened up in the 1940s by Bugsy Siegel , the mobster .
It 's also a street here , and one that I 've spent a lot of time on over the course of my life , so it 's a word that 's very dear to my heart . ''
Flowers reveals Vegas ' underbelly as he sings : `` Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas / Give us your dreamers , your harlots and your sin . ''
Q magazine asked Flowers if he was n't concerned about sounding preachy .
He replied : `` I 'm always conscious of that .
But I definitely do n't feel I 'm on a pedestal .
I just feel I 'm walking amongst . ''
Sam 's Town casino , after which the Killers ' second album was named after , sits on Flamingo road .
