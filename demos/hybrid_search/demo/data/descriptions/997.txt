I mean , all that melody is just really kind of cool there .
A buddy of mine kind of said it best .
He said , ` Luke , it sounds , you know , a track , it 's like The Cure or something . '
It 's probably the furthest I 've went from a country-sounding track ever .
It 's really not a country track .
But then you got my old country voice on it and that 'll simmer down the most craziest of tracks .
So it 's fun to have that kind of music behind it . ''
Bryan told The Boot : `` It 's about a guy meeting a girl , and it 's the first night that they 're hanging out .
It 's a magical night and he does n't want it to end .
It 's got a big fun chorus in it . ''
