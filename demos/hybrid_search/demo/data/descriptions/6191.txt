The fourth hit from The Cars Heartbeat City album , its video was directed by Don Monroe and Andy Warhol , who also appeared in the clip as a bartender .
It was some of Warhol 's last work , as he died in 1987 .
-LRB- thanks , Brad Wind - Miami , FL -RRB- Although it 's a light , synthesizer-driven Pop track , the lyrics to this song are quite profound , examining a person who never seems happy , and despite his efforts to find something better , always returns to where he came from .
Ric Ocasek wrote the song .
