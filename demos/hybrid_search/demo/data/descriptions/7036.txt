This is about a real person who claims to regularly reach nirvana by spending most of his time in an isolation tank .
Dr. John C. Lilly 's name appears many times in the song because he invented the tank in 1950 , hence the line , `` Are you still floating ?
God bless John C. Lilly '' that Les Claypool sings after the chorus .
