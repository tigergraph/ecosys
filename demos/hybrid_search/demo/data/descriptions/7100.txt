This touching track takes place against the backdrop of an oil spill .
Frontman Dave Longstreth explained to Tonedeaf.com : `` The song is about an accident on an offshore drilling rig - there 's some accident like an explosion or something , and this man is dying .
This song is simply reporting what 's going on .
There 's a couple of people at the scene , and the man is issuing his last words before he dies .
The song is just a transcription of that exchange . ''
