`` Jack '' is Jack Daniels whiskey , and `` Jose '' is Jose Cuervo tequila .
Clyne , who was lead singer in The Refreshments before forming The Peacemakers , is from Arizona and makes frequent trips to Mexico , where tequila is the drink of choice .
Says Clyne : `` That was basically a narrative of a real-life experience .
It was the end of The Refreshments days .
It was actually during the Bottle And Fresh Horses tour .
I stepped off the bus in Memphis , Tennessee , and stepped inside .
It was before the major proliferation of tequila ; there was a time when tequila was a drink of banditos and pirates , and not cigar smoking executives so much .
I went into this bar and ordered one up , and it was actually around the same time that my friend - my best friend , actually , at the time - had just died , and so I was purposely going to go on an afternoon bender .
I stepped off the bus into the bar and ordered a shot of tequila , and the bartenderess just read me the riot act .
It was a pretty quick melee , and I 'd say she won .
I did n't end up getting kicked out , but I did have to drink whiskey . ''
Roger made up the toast at the end of the song , utilizing what little Spanish he knows .
Says Clyne : '' ` Adios , rogando ' literally means , with a hammer , giving you , ` God be praised , and with the hammer given me , here are my tools , ' ` Katie , bar the door , pass the gun powder and praise the lord , ' kind of the same interpretation .
They 're both idiomatic in English and in Spanish .
I made it up the day I was recording it .
I knew there had to be something in there , but I did n't have it down exactly how I wanted it , so I woke up early on the day we recorded it , and worked out that toast .
And that was harder than , actually , the rest of the song . ''
