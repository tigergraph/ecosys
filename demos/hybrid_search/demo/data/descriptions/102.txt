The Low Anthem is a folk rock trio from Providence , Rhode Island comprising Ben Knox Miller , Jeff Prystowsky and Jocie Adams .
This song from the band 's fourth album , Smart Flesh , begins with the line : `` I was in the air when the towers came down , in a bar on the 84th floor , `` and is set to a tune borrowed from Springsteen 's `` Racing In The Street . ''
In an interview with Mojo magazine , Miller refuted the suggestion that it is about America 's response to 9/11 , saying it instead refers to the album 's inspirational hero , Philippe Petit , the French high-wire artist who walked between New York 's Twin Towers in 1974 .
`` That song is a fictional bar-stool moment with Philippe Petit as the narrator , Miller explained .
`` 9/11 recontextualised this iconic building that Petit had done something beautiful with and that is what this song is about .
There 's no political agenda for this album . ''
