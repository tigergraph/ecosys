This song addresses the media , who had given the reclusive Morrison some poor press .
Morrison told BBC Radio 4 's Today about this track : `` Nobody knows me .
None of these people know me .
They do n't know where I came from , they do n't know where I 've been , they do n't know what it took and they do n't know how hard it was .
They do n't know me , so that 's what the song is addressing .
How can a poor boy get a message through to you . ''
