Vic Fuentes has described `` Million Dollar Houses -LRB- The Painter -RRB- '' as one of the most personal songs he 's ever written with the band .
This is notable since the singer has described his songwriting as almost always a very personal process .
`` I think as long as you take risks and do everything with soul , you are going to get results that nobody else in the world can recreate , '' he explained toKill Your Scene.The song revolves around the singer 's parents and how they lost their house ; Fuentes has said the song was written as a gift to them .
`` It describes how they never let money tear them apart over the years even though they struggled to support us , '' he told LittleRockerMedia .
The song , like much of Fuentes work , shifts between poetic imagery and stark declarations .
`` Million Dollar Houses '' appears near the end of the band 's second album , 2010 's Selfish Machines .
The album is considered to be an all-around more polished effort than their debut , with stronger songwriting , more intricate production , and increased musical experimentation .
In an interview with Rock Edition , Fuentes said that it is `` about human nature and our natural tendencies to want , love , and take things .
It 's about getting in touch with the animal-like qualities that we all have inside us . ''
Lyrically , the song describes the struggles of a working class painter and his efforts to hold together his marriage despite the various hardships he endures .
Written from the painter 's perspective , the song ironically juxtaposes the painter 's own life , often penniless , with the wealthy existence of the people whose houses he paints for a living .
The chorus both thanks his wife for her continued love while admitting he 'd understand if she left him for somebody better off .
Self-doubt , poverty , and the redemptive power of love are all touched upon .
