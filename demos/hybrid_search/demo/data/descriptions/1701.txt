This mystical , hallucinogenic sprawl was inspired in part by a friend of MGMT who fell seriously ill with an unknown ailment .
Another inspiration was Steven Martin 's memoirs about living in southeast Asia , Opium Fiend .
Vocalist Andrew VanWyngarden told NME : `` He 's this guy who was obsessed with opium paraphernalia and that era of opium use in the late 1800s , then got addicted to it .
It 's got the wispy spirit of opiate drugs crawling through it . ''
