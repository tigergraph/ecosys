This is a track from American pop group Hanson 's eighth studio album , Shout it Out .
The sibling trio told Billboard magazine that they `` just wanted to have some fun '' on the record .
`` We wanted to make an upbeat record , '' oldest brother Isaac Hanson said .
`` I think we were just ready to move forward with a really upbeat kind of attitude - this is probably the most upbeat record we 've done , period .
I think we 're saying that you can have a heart and compassion for others and do good things in your life , and at the same time dance in the street .
`` Youngest Hanson Zac added that `` it 's a record where we said , ` Yeah , let 's just play really loud cowbell and horns ... As long as that 's what makes you feel motivated and excited and gives you a sense of joy when you hear this music , that 's what we need to do . ' ''
This is one of seven tracks on the album that feature horn charts by Jerry Hey -LRB- Michael Jackson , Earth , Wind & Fire -RRB- , while one of Motown 's Funk Brothers , bassist Bob Babbitt , also guests on Shout it Out .
`` Y' know , we grew up listening to a lot of that early R&B stuff , especially '60s and '70s R&B , '' Isaac Hanson noted to Billboard magazine .
`` Otis -LRB- Redding -RRB- and countless others , and Motown ... you forget how much horns played a part in a lot of really iconic kind of American R&B sound .
And that also translated into more pop and singer-songwriter stuff we used to listen to , like Billy Joel 's An Innocent Man , which is one of his biggest records , there 's horns all over the placed on that record .
That was the stuff we grew up listening to and really worked its way onto this record . ''
