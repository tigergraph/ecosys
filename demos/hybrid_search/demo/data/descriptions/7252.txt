Most of the songs on the album are based on real people and real incidents .
This song , for instance , was inspired by a friend of frontman and song-writer Dave McCabe who , down on his luck , became a male prostitute .
McCabe told the New Musical Express January 26 , 2008 about how Bob Dylan had inspired his songwriting for this album : `` I 've been getting up earlier in the morning to start writing .
I read this book about Bob Dylan and that 's how he did it .
Your head is in a certain space when you wake up ; you 're fresher and you feel like you 've got more time .
I 've been writing about old geezers in social clubs and my mates , but exaggerating whatever they 've been up to .
That 's where I get most of my stories from . ''
