California Swag District comprises rappers Smoov , Jayare , Yung , and dancer M-Bone .
This song about the Dougie Dance is their first entry on the Hot 100 .
One reason Cali Swag District recorded this song was to distance themselves from the LA Jerk movement .
Smoov explained to Chicks With Guns Magazine : `` This song we picked because it separated us from the Jerk movement , if you watch the video , nobody 's jerkin in it , nobody has on skinny jeans and all that stuff , there 's nothing wrong with that , it 's just not us , it 's does n't fit our personalities or where we came from .
Our music can be described more like ` fun ' but on the other hand if you listen to our other music , we have real songs , songs you can feel , some songs you can party to , you can ride in your car with the top down to , vacuum your living room to , just all around fun music . ''

He told us we should make a song about the Dougie , he gave us the hook he told us to do the song , we went to the studio put together a beat , and made it happen we wrote our verses and made the song go , we put a female on the hook , made it sound right and it just went . ''
