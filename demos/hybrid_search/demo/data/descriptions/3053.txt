This song seems to be about Anthony Kiedis ' love for his girlfriend at the time , Heather Christie .
Some interpretation : `` Everything inside of me is burning up for you to see . ''
- He 's dying to show and tell her everything about himself .
`` Compare us to a Ferris Wheel . ''
- may relate to how their relationship has been : up and down .
`` Some people do it by the book , but I prefer to go by feel . ''
- Anthony likes to treat each woman differently , not do it like everybody else does .
`` I wanted to get outta here , but every time I reappear and now I have the words my dear to whisper right into your ear . ''
- This give the Ferris Wheel line more perspective .
Anthony has tried and tried to be with her , he gave up and went out of the relationship , but then he got together again because he loves her .
And now finally he knows what he feels about her .
