Zac Hanson : `` That 's a really fun one .
Pretty simply , it 's about an alien encounter .
I do n't really believe in aliens , but it was just a funny idea that came along .
We got stuck in Albuquerque , New Mexico - we drove out from Oklahoma to make our first album , we do that every time we make an album , we drive across the country , it 's sort of the beginning of the journey of making a record and the writing process .
The car broke down in Albuquerque .
I was sitting on the side of the road , and I started coming up with the chorus part .
I brought the other guys in and said , ` I 've got this stupid song , what do you think ? '
They said , ` Hey , it 's goofy , but it 's fun , and sometimes you need that . '
It 's just about a guy 's slow turn to finally going kind of crazy . ''
The group grew up listening to '50s and '60s music , which was a big influence when they started writing their own songs .
This had a bit of a Beatles influence , as Zac explains : `` It represents the joy in music , the same way as ` Yellow Submarine . '
It 's not necessarily the most meaningful song or the perfectly well-written song with every edge trimmed and achieved , but it 's just about having fun and the joy .
That one 's kind of back to our roots as a garage band , it 's crazy . ''
