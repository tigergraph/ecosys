-LRB- thanks , Bryant - Salina , KS -RRB- The title is a reference to the Doomsday Clock , which was created in 1947 by the magazine Bulletin Of Atomic Sciences .
It was set at 7 minutes to midnight , indicating that due to the threat of nuclear war , the world was running out of time .
As tensions escalated over the years , the clock was moved forward , but has been set back several times as treaties are signed and the threat decreases .
In 1958 , the United States and Soviet Union were both testing hydrogen bombs , and the clock was moved up to 11:58 - the closest it ever got to midnight .
-LRB- thanks , Sarah - Winnipeg , Canada -RRB- This song was featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto : Vice City on a radio station , VRock , which included such other artists as Megadeth and Judas Priest .
