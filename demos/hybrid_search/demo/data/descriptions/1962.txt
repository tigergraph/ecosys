This daydreamer was inspired by an original of the same name written by Alan Smyth - the Sheffield producer who helmed the Monkeys ' early material - in the early 1980s .
Vocalist Alex Turner first came across the tune around 2004 and he recalled to NME : `` We 'd always listen to it and I always remembered this bit coming in - -LSB- sings -RSB- ` mad sounds , in your ear ... ' - so we built this one around it . ''
The Monkeys debuted the song at the Hultsfred festival in Sweden in June 2013 .
The AM album title was inspired by the Velvet Underground 's 1985 compilation album VU and this tune has been compared to Lou Reed 's solo work .
Turner told NME that he gets the Lou Reed comparison .
`` I actually wanted the whole record to have a bit of a Transformer thing about it , '' he said , `` like you 'd need to have a shower after it ... For me , that tune brings you back to life .
That tune 's a song about songs , you know ?
So it 's about when you 've got those sort of tunes that energize you somehow , or evoke something from inside you -LSB- like -RSB- ... ` Walk On The Wild Side . '' '
Elvis Costello 's drummer Pete Thomas stepped in to play percussion on this track after Matt Helders broke his hand during the recording sessions .
