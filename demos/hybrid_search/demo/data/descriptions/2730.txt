Demon Hunter open their sixth studio album , True Defiance , with this uncompressing rocker .
Frontman Ryan Clark told Alternative Press magazine : `` I had the idea for this song long before I wrote it .
We knew we really wanted to start this album with a ripper , much like we did with the title track on Storm The Gates Of Hell .
I 'll have to admit we definitely took a cue from Pantera on how to open a record .
This song was really fun to write because the idea was to keep it as relentless as possible , but still musical .
The guitar harmonies on the verses are some of my favorite riffs on the record .
I think this song displays a perfect blend of classic thrash and European influences ... a lot of speed and a little groove . ''
Clark told Alternative Press that for the intro , the band wanted it wanted it to sound like a 1980s cassette recording .
He said : `` There are a lot of elements and themes on this record that point back to the old-school , DIY approach to doing things as a band , and this was an idea that further drove that concept .
We set up together in the live room of the studio and just played the song , recording through a single room mic .
We also recorded the performance onto an old cassette , but interestingly enough , the room mic sounded just as junky . ''
