This joint features Raekwon 's Wu-Tang colleague Ghostface Killah and Rick Ross .
He explained to Billboard magazine how he got the latter MC onboard : `` Ross is a good friend of mine .
Ross did things for me before and I had done something on his last album Teflon Don , and it was just a favor returned .
I felt I had something that I wanted to try him on and give him that Wu-Tang flavor and see if he could rep over it , and he jumped in and handled his business .
I told him what I was doing and he was like ` Yo , I 'm down .
I 'm a big fan . ' ''
