This song is about a young man who owns an old Pontiac , is dissatisfied with his hometown as well as his job and just about everything else .
He quits his job , grabs his girlfriend , loads up his Pontiac with what little they want to take .
As the lyrics suggest , they listened to Johnny Cash en route to Las Vegas , where they presumably eloped .
-LRB- thanks , Darrell - Eugene , Oregon -RRB- This was originally recorded by Tracy Byrd in 2005 .
It was written by Country songwriters Rodney Clawson , Vicky McGehee and John Rich .
