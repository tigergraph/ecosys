This song finds Johnny Marr rueing how electronic media creates and kills relationships .
He told NME : `` I had this idea of how we get together and un-together in the digital age .
People split up through text messages , meet up using pixels , fall out and confront each other with keyboards and touchpads .
Screens are replacing faces and hearts .
I 'm not arguing for or against that , I 'm just observing it . ''
