`` Do n't Cry No Tears '' is a song typical for the album Zuma , the first album after the famed `` Ditch Trilogy , '' which sees Young picking his spirits back up and getting back together with his beloved Crazy Horse backing band.It was also one of the break-up songs .
In this one Neil comes off as almost icy as he tells his ex to stop blubbering and move on .
Young had recently experienced a break-up with actress Carrie Snodgrass , who was the mother of his son Zeke .
Young was being quite honest here - he was loving the new swinging bachelor life and happy after pulling out of his depressed funk .
Young scored a trifecta of dumping right around the time of `` Do n't Cry No Tears . ''
First he dumped Crazy Horse again right when they were beginning to get their second wind with the tour for Zuma .
Then he semi-reunited with CSN -LRB- & Y -RRB- only to pick Stephen Stills to collaborate with for Long May You Run and cut Crosby and Nash cold out of the action .
Then he famously turned around and bit Stills , too .
Neil Young is many things , but he 's never been accused of being clingy.Neil Young : Long May You Run : The Illustrated History gives the text of the telegram Young sent to Stills to let him know that the Stills-Young Band was finished : `` Dear Stephen , funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way .
Eat a peach , Neil . ''
That 's Frank Sampedro on rhythm guitar , Billy Talbot on bass , and Ralph Molina on drums .
Sampedro was the newest member of Crazy Horse and has stuck with them , but the group is so tight that even after all these years , he 's still referred to by the others as `` the new guy . ''
Talbot and Molina discovered Sampedro and brought him to Young for an audition .
It turned out Sampedro had spent a lot of time listening to Young 's album Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and jamming along to it on his own guitar - in fact he 'd learned all the parts !
