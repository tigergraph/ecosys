Beck explained to Rolling Stone magazine February 21 , 2008 , that the lyrical inspiration for this song came from the film and video director Spike Jonze .
Said Beck : `` Spike and I talked about doing a video together for ten years before we actually ever did one .
One of our first conversations was about the movie Convoy - he was obsessed with it .
He wanted to do a video where I was in a convoy , so I wrote all this truckers-going-into-oblivion imagery . ''
In the same Rolling Stone interview , Beck explained the 1970s styled blasts of brass on this track : `` We needed to subvert the aggro posturing , so we put in disco horns . ''
