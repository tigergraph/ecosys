After writing `` Firecracker '' with Pat McLaughlin and Shawn Camp , Turner teamed up with the duo again for this song .
He told CMT : `` I had come up with this title , ` Eye Candy , ' and I 'd never really heard a song called ` Eye Candy . '
I got to thinking about what a great job we did on ` Firecracker , ' and I was thinking , ` I 've got ta write `` Eye Candy '' with these two guys . '
They came in , and we had a ball writing that song .
The hardest part was keeping it clean , but it was a fun day , needless to say . ''
`` Eye Candy '' is an American slang term that originated in the 1980s for visual images that are attractive and enjoyable but intellectually undemanding .
The term has been applied to actors or actresses perceived to have been cast primarily for the visual enjoyment of the audience and to scenically attractive television programs such as Baywatch that are easy on the eye .
From Turner 's above comments , we surmise that he is not au fait with the works of the British R&B female act Mis-Teeq , otherwise he 'd have come across the trio 's song `` Eye Candy , '' which was the title track of their second album .
Eye Candy also contained Mis-Teeq 's only Hot 100 hit `` Scandalous . ''
