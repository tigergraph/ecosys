Funeral For a Friend vocalist Matt Davies-Kreye explained the background of this track to Kerrang !
September 13 , 2008 .
`` Inspiration can come from all kinds of sources : books , music , art , photography , real life ... anything .
If you 've never seen the 1967 film Mouchette by Robert Bresson , then I suggest you go and check it out .
It 's such a tragic story about human struggle , it really inspired me to try to capture that human element with this song .
I do n't think there 's ever been a more tragic story committed to film . ''
Mouchette is a French film , which tells the story of a young teenage girl whose life is one tragedy after another .
It was based on the 1937 novel Nouvelle Histoire de Mouchette by Georges Bernanos .
