This song marked drummer Topper Headon 's first official songwriting credit for The Clash , as he wrote all of the music for the song .
A common mistake though is the assumption that as he sings lead vocals on the song -LRB- also his first vocal performance for The Clash -RRB- , he was the one who wrote the lyrics .
This is incorrect , as they are actually singer Joe Strummer 's lyrics , unlike bassist Paul Simonon 's `` The Guns Of Brixton , '' where he wrote all the music AND lyrics .
The Clash first introduced this song into their live set in April 1981 , and it became a popular concert fixture for the rest of the year and into the Far East tour in 1982 , becoming Topper Headon 's live showcase similar to `` The Guns of Brixton '' for Paul Simonon .
`` Ivan Meets G.I. Joe '' started as a brief band in-joke from an interview guitarist Mick Jones had given to Rolling Stone magazine , in which he concluded that `` people prefer to dance than to fight wars . ''
-LRB- `` G.I. Joe '' is a term for an American soldier , and also the brand of a popular military-themed line of toys , comics books , and even a movie franchise . -RRB-
In that regard , Joe Strummer 's lyrics make perfect sense : they cast the two world superpowers involved in the Cold War into a disco dance competition , and turns their imposing chemical weapon threats into bizarre dance moves -LRB- `` The Vostok Bomb , the Stalin strike , he tried every move , he tried to Hitch Hike ... '' -RRB- .
There are also brief mentions to The Clash 's own favorite nightclub haunts such as New York 's Studio 54 and Le Palace in Paris .
The song ends on an ironic note where the spectators of the `` dance-off '' get bored with America and the USSR 's posturing and go `` Over the road , to watch China explode ! ''
