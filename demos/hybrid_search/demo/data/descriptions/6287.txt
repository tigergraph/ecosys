This Great Depression-era blues/country gospel song was first recorded in 1931 by South Carolina evangelist Blind Joe Taggart .
It was later revived in modern times on alternative country group Uncle Tupelo 's acoustic record March 16-20 1992 .
Willie Nelson 's take -LRB- included on his 2010 album Country Music -RRB- has guitar and vocal harmonies by Band of Joy guitarist and co-producer Buddy Miller .
Robert Plant 's version was chosen as the theme music for the second series of the Kelsey Grammer-starring political drama , Boss .
The song was selected following a discussion between the two friends .
Explained Grammer : `` We had drinks one night in New York and I had just seen his concert with the Band of Joy .
He said , ` You know , Satan , Your Kingdom Must Come Down is a great song . '
I said , ` Yeah , it is a great song . '
I fought for it -- I think it 's remarkable as a piece to open the show .
It leaves a mystery open . ''
