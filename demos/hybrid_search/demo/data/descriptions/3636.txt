Harry Hood is from the Hood Dairy Company , a New England milk company based in Boston .
The members of Phish lived next to a Hood milk plant .
`` You can feel good about Hood '' was the company 's slogan .
The thank you to Mr. Miner was possibly from the person who lived in the house before the band .
Phone calls and letters would come for him and one caught the band 's eye , a letter began with `` Thank you Mr. Miner . ''
The line `` Harry , where do you go when the lights go out ? ''
was Brian Long 's contribution .
Others have said the line refers the lights at the plant going out at some point each night .
The audience often had glowstick wars when Phish played this in concert .
