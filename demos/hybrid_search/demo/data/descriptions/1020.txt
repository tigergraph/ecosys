Guitarist Zoltan Bathory -LRB- from Metal Hammer -RRB- : `` Lyrically , it 's one of my favourites , a very dark song -- not a full-on ballad , not a pretty composition , and with quite a simple structure , which again we worked hard to achieve .
At one point , the song was a bit more complex in nature , but when we heard how great Ivan -LSB- Moody -RSB- 's lyrics were , we knew we had to simple things down so as not to distract the listener , to allow the weight of the words to come through .
There 's also a really blazing solo from Jason -- there 's some pretty abrasive playing there , and that helps to give the song a more aggressive overall feel . ''
