Anton Zaslavski is a Russian-German producer and DJ who records under the name of Zedd .
He broke through in the US in 2012 reaching # 38 on the Billboard 200 with his debut album , Clarity , as well as co-producing Justin Bieber and Nicki Minaj 's hit single `` Beauty and a Beat . ''
The collaboration came about after Zedd complimented Foxes on her track `` Youth '' over Skype .
The Russian-German producer then offered the singer the chance to take on this EDM tune .
`` If someone had said to me , ` Sing this dance song , ' I probably would have said no , '' Foxes admitted to Billboard magazine .
`` But I heard the song , and it was really emotional , and I felt like it was not too far from what I was about ... I remember first listening to it and thinking , ` I 'd be so stupid to not do this . ' ''
Zedd wrote this song with Matthew Koma , Skylar Grey , and the producer/DJ Porter Robinson .
Koma can be heard on another Clarity track , `` Spectrum . ''
Grey 's composed parts of the T.I. song `` Castle Walls '' and the Eminem/Rihanna collaboration `` Love The Way You Lie . ''
Her talent for writing impassioned lyrics is apparent on this track , which finds Foxes singing about a doomed relationship that she ca n't leave behind .
The album 's title track found Zedd hooking up with a relatively unknown singer called Foxes .
He explained to Digital Spy : `` I really like working with unique and unknown artists as they usually bring something fresh to a song .
For ` Clarity ' , I was looking for a certain type of singer as it 's a very difficult song to sing .
She nails it . ''
This 128 BPM , synth-driven Dance hit has an unusual structure , with the short , but memorable chorus showing up four times in the song .
An instrumental break occurs early in the song , and is squeezed in between the first two repetitions of the chorus .
There are just two verses , but they run 30 seconds each - an eternity in the Dance genre - with the song dipping to near silence before the second one .
This is followed by the third chorus , which around the 3-minute mark goes into a chanting bridge as the beat builds .
Another break follows , with Foxes singing bits of the chorus lyrics -LRB- `` Why are you my clarity ... '' -RRB- until it resolves with that last chorus .
All this content pushes the running time of the song to 4:31 , making it one of the longer Dance hits of its time .
This won the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording .
