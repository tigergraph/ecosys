This idyllic song - complete with references to orange blossoms and hummingbirds - was inspired by Algiers Point in New Orleans .
Calexico is based in Tucson , Arizona , but wrote and recorded most of their Algiers album in New Orleans .
Instead of just traveling there to record , they spent ten days soaking up the culture coming up with song ideas .
`` Hush '' came to lead signer Joey Burns unexpectedly when he found himself at Algiers Point , which is on the Mississippi River across from the French Quarter .
`` It 's an old neighborhood with a lot of old houses and families living there , '' Burns told us .
