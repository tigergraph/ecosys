Vocalist Jonathan Higgs told The Line Of Best Fit that this is one of a couple of songs on Arc `` that end with me turning my own preachiness on myself .
Saying , actually I do n't make any changes either .
I 'm sorry I 'm so s -- t. '' He added : `` On ` Radiant ' I say : ` you can make a difference so easy but you do n't . '
And then at the end I say : ' I can make a difference so easy but I do n't . ' ''
The song was conceived by Everything Everything when they supported Snow Patrol on their Fallen Empires UK Arena tour .
The band played it every night and arranged it on the fly during those gigs .
