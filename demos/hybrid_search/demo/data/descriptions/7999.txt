John Mayer recorded a pair of songs titled `` Wildfire '' for his Paradise Valley album .
The first was a mellow , minute-and-a-half tone poem written and performed by Frank Ocean , and the second was a response penned by Mayer , which briefly cracked the Billboard Hot 100 based on digital sales .
Mayer first hooked up with Ocean when he played guitar on two tracks from the New Orleans singer-songwriter 's Channel Orange album : `` White '' and `` Pyramids . ''
He also appeared in the latter song 's video .
`` Frank is such an interesting , deep , touched , wonderful guy , '' Mayer told Rolling Stone .
`` They do n't make a lot of other Frank Oceans , and the guy is looking for another .
And the way that his mind works is craving the same frequency that he 's able to communicate on , and I think he 's just searching for that kind of depth that he has inside of himself in someone else .
He 's fascinating to me .
He 's so great . ''
