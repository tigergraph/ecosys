Enter Shikari close their third album with this five minute heartfelt track that reiterates and concludes everything they 've said on A Flash Flood Of Colour .
Rou Reynolds told Kerrang !
: `` We all have such weight on our shoulders - but it 's also an honour , really .
We are all alive in such an exciting time , we literally do have the choice of whether to start living sustainably or completely self-destruct .
It 's about that choice for our generation and the excitement and the flood of emotion that this brings .
It 's also about love and compassion and the force that keeps us all going and feeling like we have a direction , a meaning and - ultimately - a sense of purpose . ''
