So I went down by the pool at the Sunset Marquis and I wrote all the lyrics and the melody in about two hours .
It 's such a good-time song .
I think it 's what America needs right now , just putting the roof down in your car on your way to the beach . ''
The song 's music video was shot by Norwegian-born , Los Angeles-based director and photographer Ray Kay , who resume includes visuals for Britney Spears , Lady Gaga , Justin Bieber and Beyonc√© .
