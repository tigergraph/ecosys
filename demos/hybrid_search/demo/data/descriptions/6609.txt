Alt-J frontman Joe Newman has been heavily influenced by cinema all his life .
For instance , the An Awesome Wave album title comes from a line in American Psycho , while the lyrics for this gentle acoustic folk ode are an ode to Natalie Portman 's 12-year-old character in Luc Besson 's thriller , Léon .
`` I originally wanted to write all my songs about film and have that novelty , '' he told Loud and Quiet magazine , `` but as I 've developed I 've got more self-involved and started writing about break-ups and being beaten up .
So it 's gone down the more traditional path , but I have n't retired the idea of doing more film-based music . ''
The studio where An Awesome Wave was recorded was n't soundproofed and at one point if you listen carefully to this track , you can hear the sound of a bus braking .
Why did Newman choose to base the lyrics on Natalie Portman 's character ?
He explained to NME : `` When I was about 12 , the film Léon had a major effect on me .
Matilda is this amazing character .
All her family are killed and she forces Léon the hitman to be friends with her so she can get revenge .
I was sucked in by her .
I had a boy crush on Léon and a girl crush on Matilda . ''
The line `` Just like Johnny Flynn said , ` the breath I 've taken and the one I must ' to go on '' is a reference to a lyric from alternative-folk singer-songwriter Johnny Flynn 's song `` The Wrote And The Writ . ''
The tune is a track from his 2008 debut album , A Larum .
