On this oddly time-signatured and orchestrated lullaby , songwriter Alex Turner pays romantic homage to a female companion , presumably the singer 's TV presenter girlfriend , Alexa Chung .
The Monkeys recorded this song at The Integraton a 38-foot high wooden dome a half hours drive south of Joshua Tree in the Mojave Desert where they were based .
Turner explained to Uncut Magazine : `` Yeah , we were mostly locked up in this little house doing the record , but we had time for a little bit of recreation !
Later on in the recording we did a trip to this place called the Integratron .
It 's a structure erected by a fellow called George Van Tassel who had a visit in the night from some kind of being who instructed him to build an acoustically sound dome involving an electro-magnet .
I have n't got the diagram here but it 's believed that the objective in building this thing was to recharge or rejuvenate human cells , except he never finished it before he died .
Because it 's acoustically sound , if someone talks across from you it sounds like they 're right by your ear .
It 's a mad place .
We did a little recording of ` Secret Door ' there one night . ''
This is one of two Humbug tracks to be produced by Simian Mobile Disco 's James Ford , a veteran of Favourite Worst Nightmare and Turner 's ` side project ' The Last Shadow Puppets ' The Age of the Understatement .
The Last Shadow Puppets certainly inspired this pop ballad 's uplifting orchestration .
