This track , like a number of others on the album , was inspired by Spiteri 's split from her boyfriend Ashley Heath , the father of the singer 's daughter Misty Kyd .
The singer told the Daily Record May 10 , 2008 : `` Making this record was therapeutic for me .
A lot of these songs were me dealing with some painful events , but you move on to the next chapter . ''
