This funky song is a track from Californian rockers Cake 's sixth studio album , Showroom of Compassion .
It concerns an issue that has been bugging frontman John McCrea since his days as a youngster when so many of his seniors sported facial hair above their upper lip .
He told Spinner why he penned a song about mustaches .
`` I think people are dealing with mustache issues in our culture , '' the Cake founder explained .
`` A lot of people grew up with men around them who had mustaches , and I think it 's a therapeutic thing for us to talk about it .
`` McCrea added that he saw the song as a means to put to rights some terrifying experiences he had with the unsightly fuzz as a youngster .
`` The song was certainly therapeutic for me having grown up in California in the '70s and '80s , '' he deadpanned .
`` You rarely see a waxed mustache anymore , but I have a few traumatic memories from childhood , like of dudes who used wax to make the ends of their mustaches into a sharp object .
Yeah , it 's f -- ed up .
As a kid , I saw this , and even then , I knew this was such a strange world . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Alicia J. Rose who not only is a photographer but also is an avant-garde accordionist , who records under the name of Miss Murgatroyd .
Said McCrea to Spinner : `` We wanted a video that was both creepy AND life-affirming .
I think we got more than we bargained for here . ''
