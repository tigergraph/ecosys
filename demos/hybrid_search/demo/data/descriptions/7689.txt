Although written and recorded entirely in Japanese , it is safe to say this folkish type song will be appreciated more in Gilbert 's native America than in the Land of the Rising Sun .
The title translates as `` My Head Is Made Of Tomatoes ; '' the lyrics , such as they are , are in the same vein , although they do appear to have a serious point .
While most Paul Gilbert songs are constructed to demonstrate his mastery of the fretboard , this one was used as an aid to learning the language while he was working in Japan .
