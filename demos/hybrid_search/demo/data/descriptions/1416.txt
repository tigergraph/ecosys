The music for this song comes from The Notorious B.I.G. 's track `` Sky 's the Limit , '' which samples Bobby Caldwell 's `` My Flame '' and D. Train 's `` Keep On . ''
On the In and Out of Love album , Dennis explores the various stages of love and the ups and downs of relationships .
In this song , she is still with her man , but they do n't have the same feelings for each other that they did before .
