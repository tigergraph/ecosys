This is the first single from 3 Doors Down 's `` best of '' collection The Greatest Hits .
The record contains nine of their previous hits that have been remixed and re-mastered , alongside three new songs , `` There 's a Life , '' `` Goodbyes '' and this track .
Regarding the story of the song , 3 Doors Down singer Brad Arnold told Artist Direct : `` It 's meant to be an inspiring song .
It 's really about taking the world and making it better than you found it .
It 's about giving more than you take .
If we all took that attitude , the world would be a great place man . ''
Marti Frederiksen , one of the group 's collaborators on 2011 's Time of My Life , worked with 3 Doors Down again on the new songs .
Guitarist Chris Henderson told Billboard magazine : `` We had a really good time and liked him .
On Time of My Life we worked with a few songwriters , but they did their homework almost too well ; when they brought their ideas to us it sounded like our songs .
We were like , ` What the hell do we need you guys for ? '
So this time we approached it with that in mind and just used -LRB- Frederiksen -RRB- instead of a bunch of guys . ''
