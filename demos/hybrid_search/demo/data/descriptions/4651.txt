This is the title track of Jimmy Eat World 's eighth studio album Damage .
The record is centered around a concept of the way long-term relationships go awry .
`` As you get older it 's more interesting to have a theme that everything tries to support - I would say this album has a theme , '' frontman Jim Adkins told Rolling Stone .
`` I would describe it as an attempt at making an adult breakup record .
The consequences to what the characters are going through are more significant .
There 's just more to it .
I 'm 37 and the world around me is a lot different than when I was writing break-p songs in my 20s . ''
The song was released on Side A of the Damage 7 inch single for Record Store Day on April 20 , 2013 .
The disc also included a cover of Radiohead 's `` Stop Whispering , '' which Adkins told Rolling Stone the band selected because it 's a good song `` that you never hear anyone play . ''
