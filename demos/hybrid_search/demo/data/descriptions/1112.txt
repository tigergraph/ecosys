This poignant ballad was inspired in large part by the sudden passing of Stone 's father during the recording of Unexpected .
`` It 's funny how people can slip away so fast , and suddenly they 're in your past , '' she said .
`` You wonder about what you could have - or should have - done differently .
It 'll make you think sometimes . ''
