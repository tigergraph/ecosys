Based on the lyrics and certain video footage , this song seems to be about Randy Blythe 's hatred for Los Angeles , California .
The line , `` Mulholland 's on fire '' refers to Mulholland Drive , which is a road in Los Angeles .
`` 92 ' should have burnt this f -- ker to the ground '' signifies the riots and fires that happened in 1992 after the Rodney King trial controversy .
