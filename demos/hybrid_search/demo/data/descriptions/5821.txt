At first this appears to be an outlaw ballad about John Wesley Hardin -LRB- 1853-1895 -RRB- a Texas sharp-shooter who it is claimed had murdered over 40 people by the time he was sent to prison in 1878 .
In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 1969 , Dylan discussed how the song did n't turn out as he originally intended : `` I was gon na write a ballad on - like maybe one of those old cowboy - you know , a real long ballad .
But in the middle of the second verse , I got tired .
I had a tune , and I did n't want to waste the tune , it was a nice little melody , so I just wrote a quick third verse , and I recorded that .
I knew people were gon na listen to that song and say that they did n't understand what was going on , but they would 've singled that song out later , if we had n't called the album John Wesley Harding and placed so much importance on that , for people to start wondering about it .
If that had n't been done , that song would 've come up and people would have said it was a throw-away song . ''
On the cover of John Wesley Harding , on either side of Dylan -LRB- who was wearing the same jacket he 'd worn on the sleeve of Blonde On Blonde -RRB- is Luxman and Purna Das of the Bengali Bauls music collective , who were staying with Dylan 's manager Albert Grossman at the time .
Standing behind them is Charlie Joy , a Woodstock carpenter and stonemason .
The foursome all sport a rather disheveled `` common man '' look and the whole arrangement was possibly a dig at the Beatles and their Sgt. Pepper cover with the Fab Four placed at the center of a group of famous personalities .
Dylan mistakenly added the ` G ' to Hardin 's name .
