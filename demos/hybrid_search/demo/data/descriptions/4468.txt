This toe-tapping track is the first single from the third Zac Brown Band album Uncaged .
Frontman Zac Brown penned the song with frequent songwriting partner Wyatt Durrette and Georgia singer-songwriter Levi Lowrey , who has performed as supporting act for the band . ''
` The Wind ' is a barn-burnin ' , bluegrass tune off this record , '' said Zac of the tune to The Boot .
`` It 's probably the most country song we 've ever done . ''
The song 's animated music video was directed by Beavis & Butthead and King of the Hill creator Mike Judge .
It shows Zac Brown being rebuilt by his bandmates after a truckin ' adventure in the woods goes wrong .
Brown is eventually reincarnated as guitar-shredding , big game hunting robot , Robo Redneck.Multi-instrumentalist Clay Cook explained to Roughstock why the band decided to collaborate with Mike Judge .
`` Well , I think it 's always been in the back of our minds that we were going to do something with him , at least from three years ago , '' he said .
`` And the planning went into it a couple of months ago that we were going to do the first single and that was it .
It was one of those things where we always knew we were gon na work with Mike and it 's finally happened , you know ? ''
Durrette explained to The Boot that the song 's chorus was inspired by somebody that he loves very much .
`` I was laying in bed and had just woken up , and my son had crawled in bed with me earlier that night , '' he recalled .
`` He was laying next to me ; I opened my eyes and there was his face .
The chorus , ` where the wind blows , ' I wrote it about just looking at him and never feeling a love like that in my entire life . ''
