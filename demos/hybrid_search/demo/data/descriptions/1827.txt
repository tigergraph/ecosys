`` The ultimate distillation of the overriding theme '' of With Love and Squalor , this song combines the subjects of sexual terror and the `` social ramifications of suddenly being a viable band , ` viable ' meaning that other people actually know you exist and give a sh * t about it , no matter how small a sh * t that is , '' as Keith Murray tells it .
`` I think this song spends a lot of time worrying about why people that know me and recognize that it 's sort of a cyclical thing in their mind , which I get totally bent out of shape over active behavior so much that it might become sexual about anything . ''
Regarding the line , `` I 'm sick of waking up on your floor for the sixth or seventh night in a row '' Murray explains , `` That is largely delivered in total degrees , and an obscurity .
But that is actually a pretty literal line .
There was a girl that I was in a relationship with , a relationship that really was n't happening , we were just totally hanging out and flirting without even acknowledging it was flirting .
But she was just a very , very good friend .
So I would be in Manhattan or somewhere , out drinking until five in the morning , and then obviously not want to drive or take a 40-minute subway ride home .
So it legitimately involved consistently sleeping on the floor of somebody 's apartment with whom I should have been in bed with , or just gone home , and make a decision one way or the other about how it was going to go , rather than go to her house and be like , ` Oh , well , I guess I 'll lie here on the floor then , and I 'll see you tomorrow . ' ''
