Downtown Church consists almost entirely of religious and gospel songs .
However this cover of a Big Mama Thornton R&B track cataloguing the excesses of an unfaithful , hard-drinking man is the one exception .
This was the song producer Buddy Miller played through the PA regularly so as to center Griffin 's backing group .
She explained with a chuckle why she decided to cover this very secular song on an album contained sacred numbers : `` The band was so greasy by the end of that week .
I wanted to do it , just to have it .
I did n't really think we would get it on the record , and Buddy said , ` Oh , I 'll figure out a way . '
And he did .
I think he also had in mind tipping the hat to skepticism .
Not a bad thing to include . ''
The song was featured in an episode of True Blood called `` I Smell A Rat , '' which aired in 2010 .
Thornton is best known for cutting Lieber & Stoller 's `` Hound Dog '' before Elvis - it seems she liked animal metaphors .
