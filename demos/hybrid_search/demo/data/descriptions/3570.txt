Slipknot drummer Chris Fehn -LRB- # 3 -RRB- , says of `` Surfacing '' : `` It basically encompasses everything .
Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life : Do n't judge me .
Everything that you think that you know about the world , and about Slipknot , and about your own life , might not be the case .
So I think it 's just openmindedness and just be cool . ''
