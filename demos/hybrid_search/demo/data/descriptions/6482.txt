The second single from American Idol winner , Phillip Phillips ' debut album The World from the Side of the Moon is a kick-drum-pounding , Indie-Folk acoustic love song .
Gregg Wattenberg helmed the track .
A co-writer on O.A.R. 's `` Shattered -LRB- Turn the Car Around -RRB- , '' his other production credits include Five for Fighting 's `` Superman -LRB- It 's Not Easy -RRB- '' and Train 's `` Hey Soul Sister . ''
Phillips recruited him to produce The World from the Side of the Moon after they wrote together `` Get Up Get Down '' at Wattenberg 's New York studio .
Phillips told Billboard magazine , `` He 's a goofy guy and I 'm a goofy guy - and when I had to come up with a producer , I mentioned him and we made it happen . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Joseph Toman .
The clip features footage of Phillips performing mixed with a pastiche of home video shots of important moments in lives .
Said Toman , `` It 's a celebration of life , and hopefully something that everyone can find something in to relate to . ''
This is one of the few instances of a hit single where not only the act 's name -LRB- `` Phillip -LRB- s -RRB- '' -RRB- repeats , but so does at least one of the words in its title .
Other hit tunes that sported both artists and titles with likewise doubled -LRB- or tripled -RRB- words include :1982 `` Talk Talk '' by Talk Talk .1985 `` A View To A Kill '' by Duran Duran .1989 `` A Dream 's a Dream '' by Soul II Soul .2005 `` Goodnight Goodnight '' by Hot Hot Heat .2012 `` Boom Boom '' by Rye Rye .
Phillips co-wrote 10 of the 14 tracks on The World from the Side of the Moon , but this was one that he did n't contribute towards .
He told Yahoo !
Canada Music : `` Todd Clark and Derek Fuhrmann , they wrote -LSB- it -RSB- and brought it to me and I thought it was a beautiful song .
The more I 've played it live , the more I 've made it more my own and people seem to really connect with it and really enjoy it . ''
Phillips performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live !
on January 16 , 2013 to coincide with the twelfth season premiere of American Idol .
This was an obvious choice to be the 2013 American Idol farewell song in the season after Phillips triumphed on the show .
