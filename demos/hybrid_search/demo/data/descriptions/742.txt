In our interview with Ryan Star , the Long Island-based singer/songwriter told us that this is one of his favorite songs on the album .
Said Star : '' It was written as a punk rock song , but we recorded it as a piano , more of a ballad .
And I really love it .
People keep asking , ` Is it political ? '
because there 's a line where I say , ` Hey , hey , head of state , send me home . '
It 's really more about a relationship separated by a war , but it 's more about longing for that person , and missing them , and what that life is like missing someone so much .
Which I know a lot about , being on the road constantly .
But it sets up this beautiful scene of bombs dropping over this man , but he 's holding a note that his lover left him so he could think of her and remember her and keep him strong when he 's awake and with what he has to do . ''
Explaining how this song went from a punk rocker to a piano ballad , Star told us : `` We kept trying to find different ways to approach songs on this album .
And this one would have been a rocker and fun and everything , and I play it that way live , still .
But when we sat down and started stripping it and letting it be softer , I found that the vocals , the story , came out a little more .
And a lot of this album is really about the songwriting and about the stories and about the imagery that I created , the movies in my mind that I like to bring out .
I always joke around that I 'm a lazy filmmaker , because I like to make these movies .
I see the characters and everything in my head .
I do n't have the patience to write a two-hour script , but I have patience for a few minutes of a song . ''
