Many of you will be familiar with American actor and singer Matthew Morrison for his portrayal of the Spanish teacher Will Schuester in the Fox dramedy Glee .
This rock ballad is a track from his self-titled debut album .
Morrison performed the song in the final episode of Glee season two . ''
-LSB- The song -RSB- 's about aspiration , '' show creator Ryan Murphy told The Hollywood Reporter .
`` It worked because we wanted to do a scene where Matt goes into a Broadway hall and sings something alone .
Plus , Matt is such a great team player and he 's done so much for different Glee charities .
`` Morrison added that Murphy gave him a chance to show off his singing chops in the finale .
`` It was going to be just a big dance piece with me doing this big dance number , '' said the Glee star .
`` But they said , ` We want you to sing it and make it a big moment . ' ''
The song was penned by 2009 American Idol winner Kris Allen with Andrew Frampton and Stephen Allen Kipner .
`` It 's actually a funny story .
I got my hands on the song .
It was an amazing song , and I did n't find out until a little later on that Kris was a writer on it , '' Morrison told The Boot , `` It was kind of strange , 'cause he did n't know either that I had done it .
`` Allen admitted in the same interview : `` I had no idea .
I got an email from the other writers saying ` Urgent , urgent , ' and then I read it , and it said that Matthew Morrison was going to sing the song , and I was pretty stoked about it . ''
