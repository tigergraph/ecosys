The ` East ' Morrison is singing about on this song is east Belfast -LRB- his home city -RRB- .
This song finds the singer disgruntled and fed up with the world .
He explained the song 's meaning to The Guardian : `` When you 've had a conspiracy against you , then you ca n't speak , because nothing that you say will be even taken on board .
If the media wants to bring somebody down , which is what they were trying to do to me at the time , you ca n't fight that ` cos it 's too big .
So that 's what that 's about . ''
