It 's more on the rock side of my musical catalog and comes straight from my die-hard fanhood of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Anthony Kiedis , one of my favorite rappers . ''
Fiasco blogged on his MySpace page about the creative process for this track .
He wrote : '' ` Solar Midnite ' is my first commercial release that I actually produced as well as wrote .
The New Moon team asked me if I could do a song specifically for the film . ''
He added : `` They invited me to an early screening of the unfinished film , from which I pulled different elements that I thought would translate into a great song .
I pulled in vocalist and bassist Graham Burris and acclaimed musician Matt Nelson to help fill out my vision musically and ... ` Solar Midnite ' was born . ''
