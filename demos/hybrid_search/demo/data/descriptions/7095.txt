This is about an abortion .
Somebody in the band , they wo n't say who , had a girlfriend who was pregnant and did n't even tell him .
She had an abortion and he found out about it after .
It 's not putting all the blame on a women , because there is a part in the chorus that goes , `` If i would have known , I ca n't say what I would 've done . ''
