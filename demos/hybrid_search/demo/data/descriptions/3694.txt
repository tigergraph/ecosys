This was Prince 's first UK # 1 hit .
It was his 37th single release , making him the artist with the most attempts to get to # 1 in the UK before achieving a chart topper .
He had had two previous UK # 1s as a songwriter , the 1984 hit single `` I Feel For You '' by Chaka Khan and Sinead O'Connor 's 1990 cover of `` Nothing Compares 2 U. '' This was released by Prince on his own NPG label and it was his first release since changing his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol .
In January 2009 , an Italian court ruled that this song was plagiarized by Prince from `` Takin ' Me to Paradise , '' written by Bruno Bergonzi and Michele Vicino .
Bergonzi told Billboard magazine after the ruling was announced : `` Our song was first released in 1983 , at the height of the Italian dance boom and it appeared on assorted compilations that were distributed internationally .
When we first heard Prince 's song we immediately took action , but this case has been dragging on for 15 years and it is n't over yet , such is the slowness of the Italian legal system .
We only decided to go public with our story now . ''
When the son of a Warner Executive suggested to Prince that he did n't have another hit record in him , he wrote this the next day .
Prince organized a clever publicity campaign to promote this single .
Many American magazines carried his face in silhouette with his message : `` Eligible bachelor seeks the most beautiful girl in the world to spend holidays with . ''
In February 1994 , he launched the song on CBS-TV 's Miss America Pageant and it was later released on Valentine 's Day .
