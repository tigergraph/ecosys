The title of Seether 's Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray comes from a lyric in this song .
Shaun Morgan originally came across the phrase in a book and the line stuck with him .
The singer paraphrased it a bit for the album to make it more workable .
Morgan told Artist Direct that the central theme running throughout Holding Onto ... is knowing when it 's best to say goodbye in a doomed relationship .
He explained : `` I think the whole concept of just letting things go .
Letting relationships that are effecting your life negatively - just saying ` you know what ?
This is not working out . '
Friends , girlfriends , family members , whatever it is .
You get to a point where you say ` okay This is obviously not conducive for either of us to be in this relationship , so why are we still battling through this ? '
It 's inane to sit there and go things are gon na get better - but they 're not gon na get better ... and then you find yourself years later going this thing was doomed from the start ... So much wasted energy goes into something that 's ultimately doomed so why even invest the time when you could invest in something that 's really positive ? ''
