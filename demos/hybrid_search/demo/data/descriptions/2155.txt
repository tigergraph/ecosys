This confessional finds T.I linking up with Andre 3000 as they both make amends for times they 've wronged those close to them .
During a listening session for Trouble Man at NYC 's Germano Studios , T.I. said he hounded the Outkast rhymer several years for a collaboration .
`` And -LSB- then -RSB- six years -LSB- later -RSB- , I got a call and he ready , -LSB- he -RSB- basically s -- t on me on my own record , '' he openly admitted of Three Stack 's verse .
`` But I 'm saying s -- t in my verses that he ca n't say , and I ca n't change that . ''
Amongst Andre 's apologies on his verse is one to his Outkast partner Big Boi , where he appears to allude to a strain in their relationship .
`` I 'm sorry I 'm awkward , my fault for fu -- in ' up the tours , '' he raps .
`` I hated all the attention so I ran from it . ''
