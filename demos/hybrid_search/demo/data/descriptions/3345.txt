This track from the debut studio album by English rapper/singer Professor Green , real name Stephen Manderson , is a collaboration with another London rapper , Example .
Manderson told Digital Spy that the Pixie Lott referencing line , `` apparently Pixie drinks lots , '' `` was born from me looking out of the car window and seeing her with a white milk moustache with the slogan ` Pixie drinks Lotts ' . ''
In the song , Manderson jokes about Katie Price 's former husband Peter Andre .
He told the Daily Star : `` At the end of the first verse I say : ` I 'd like to say thanks to Peter Andre for looking after my children , ' which could be seen as being a little bit out of order , but I do say sorry at the end of the song . ''
