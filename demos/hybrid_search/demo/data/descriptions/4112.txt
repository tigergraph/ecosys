This samples the Billy Paul track `` Let the Dollar Circulate '' from his 1975 album When Love is New .
This was produced by Don Cannon , who also helmed `` Go Crazy '' from Young Jezzy 's 2005 album Let 's Get It : Thug Motivation 101 .
Jeezy told Rolling Stone magazine : `` That 's my jam right there .
It 's a good feeling song .
When people are down , that 's what keeps us afloat - good music .
Some of the best music is made during a recession . ''
Young Jeezy explained this track to MTV News .
Said the Atlanta rapper : `` I was in New York when Don sent me that sample .
I just wanted to kind of go to that '70s feel of clubbin ' , but you still got the pain and passion in the music .
If you listen to the whole album , it 's like a ` we shall overcome ' type of album .
Like we really got to stick together on this one and get through it .
That 's what the whole recession is about .
` The dollar circulate ' is in the back of my mind .
We all know it 's messed up , but when it starts back circulating , I 'm thinking about what I can get .
I 'm thinking , ` When it gets back right , I ` mma do this , I ` mma do that . ' ''
