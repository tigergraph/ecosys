The Idler Wheel ... 's closing track is close to a cappella song .
It contains sprinklings of timpani rolls and classical piano lines whilst Apple sings lyrics in which she compares herself to butter and her lover to a hot knife .
According to an interview with New York magazine 's Dan Lee , she suspects the roots of the song lay in a Bach concert that she 'd seen in New York , and the Supremes tune `` Where Did Our Love Go ? . ''
She explained the inspiration is the place where two different types of music , `` crack together , '' which has always given her `` huge satisfaction . ''
The song 's music video was directed by filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson , whose movie There Will Be Blood is largely regarded as one of the greatest films of the 2000s .
Anderson has worked with Apple on several other of her visuals in the past including those for `` Paper Bag , '' `` Fast As You Can '' and `` Limp . ''
Apple 's older sister Amber , who is a cabaret singer that records under the name of Maude Maggart , joins her later in the song .
Fiona told New York magazine that they 'd stood at the same microphone for hours , weaving their voices in what she called , `` the most intimate moment of our lives together . ''
