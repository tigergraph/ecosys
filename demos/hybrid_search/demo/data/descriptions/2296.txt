This song was written at the Ear Studios rehearsals in September 1981 , and recorded in the Electric Lady studios in December 1981 , featuring additional instrumentation in the form of keyboards by Poly Mandell and a rap section by Futura 2000 , graffiti artist and friend of the band .
He had toured with the band for the previous two years , spray-painting a graffiti stage backdrop whilst the band played , and joining them live onstage for an improvised Rap song once he had finished his work .
He even references his graffiti work on the New York subway trains in his rap -LRB- `` The T.A. blew forty mil they say , we threw down by night , they scrubbed it off by day '' -RRB- .
There are rumors that Futura 2000 recorded a standalone track , `` The Escapades of Futura 2000 '' in these sessions too , but if he did it has never been released .
Like `` The Magnificent Seven , '' this song was remixed multiple times by Rap radio stations in New York , and a bootleg exists of an extended six-minute-plus instrumental remix of the song .
`` Overpowered By Funk '' is very much a continuation of the themes and musical styles first experimented with on `` The Magnificent Seven . ''
It is a heavy Funk track with freeform lyrics referencing capitalism -LRB- `` Do n't you love our Western ways ? '' -RRB-
, the Vietnam War -LRB- `` Home for the floating people ?
Skin for the napalm victim ? '' -RRB-
, capital punishment -LRB- `` Fry me in your shockin ' chairs '' -RRB- and even using the Funk genre of music to represent the repetitive boredom of being stuck in a dead-end job -LRB- `` Combative , repetitive , do n't life just funk you out ? '' -RRB- .
It also includes subtle references to Tarzan and Benny Goodman .
This was only played by The Clash a handful of times - in their Paris residency in September 1981 - before being dropped again .
Presumably with `` The Magnificent Seven '' still being a massive fan favorite in The Clash 's set , there was n't room for another Rap/Funk song with lengthy instrumental sections and improv lyrics .
