This song 's hook was inspired by The Cars ' track `` Drive . ''
Guitarist Alex Robertshaw explained to The Line Of Best Fit : `` We just loved the feeling of that track and wanted to play on that , and that 's kind of where we ended up with the chorus for ` Armourland . '
We were n't going for a big pop chorus or anything but just liked the sound of that record . ''
The lyrics were inspired by the 2011 riots , which Higgs saw from the homeless hostel his girlfriend worked in .
He told NME : `` It 's about being with the one you love in a world that 's falling to bits . ''
The song is based on something Everything Everything `` jokily wrote '' during their Man Alive sessions .
Bassist Jeremy Pritchard told The Line of Best Fit : `` It had this sadness , which we loved .
And we used to sing it to each other with jokey , puerile lyrics all the time but the tune has this melancholy to it .
We did n't want it to be sugary .
We wanted it to have that Cars essence to it , a sad sheen .
`` Vocalist Jonathan Higgs added : `` I wanted the general lyrics to counter-act the chorus and to be very unromantic .
And , yet , it is a love song . ''
