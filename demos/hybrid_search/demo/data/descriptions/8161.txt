Guitarist Jerry Cantrell explained the song 's meaning to AllMusic : `` That song could relate to your best friend , your girlfriend , your brother , or business partner .
It 's not necessarily saying , ` Splitting . '
It 's essentially assessing , ` Where are we at here ?
Is this working ?
Is it not working ? '
It 's keeping the communication open to figure that out .
It speaks to that .
`` At the same time , I think this is a common theme through all of our work , '' he continued .
`` When a lot of people get hung up on the negativity and the darker elements of the songs , that 's not the end of it .
It 's more like , `` Okay , where do we go ?
We can go this way or that way ?
Where are we going here ? ''
There 's an opportunity to steer it back on to the road .
There 's always the urge to take it off into the fu -- ing railing .
You know what I mean ?
That 's fu -- ing life .
It 's just a quick twitch into the fu -- ing headlights , or you 're like , ` No , I 'm not going to do that .
Let 's bring it back on to the road . ' .
That song speaks to all of those elements . ''
Cantrell shared with All Music how producer Nick Raskulinecz was forced to put his foot down on this song .
`` He took that song down , especially in the verses to let it lift in the chorus and B-section .
That was his call .
We did n't agree with it at first . ''
Drummer Sean Kinney added : `` I was n't digging it -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
On all of those previous records , nobody ever said anything in our whole career .
I guess we 're fortunate for that .
We were n't really open to that .
With Nick , he had some suggestions .
With how we get along , we listened . ''
