This uptempo song from the soundtrack of the 1983 film Flashdance was written by Doug Cotler and Richard Gilbert , produced by Phil Ramone and sung in the film by his wife Karen Ichiuji-Ramone who performs as Karen Kamon .
The theme is that of woman the hunter ; she sees this guy every day in the office and decides to make her move first .
Dream on , guys .
Flashdance was less a manhunt than a slightly off-beat romance between a girl who worked as a welder and her boss , a handsome divorcee who made the first move.The heroine , Alexandra , moonlights as an exotic dancer in one of the city 's more reputable clubs , and aspires to greater things .
The film has been called a modern retelling of the Cinderella story.Behind the theme song and `` Maniac '' , `` Manhunt '' is probably the best song in a film which though not a musical has a strong soundtrack .
