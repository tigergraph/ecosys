Paul Weller `` I got the idea for this from a picture I saw of an old boxer in the ring .
That image really appealed to me - there 's that moment where you have to put down your gloves and admit that you should give it a rest .
I suppose it 's a metaphor for anyone who feels they 've been in the same situation too long . ''
