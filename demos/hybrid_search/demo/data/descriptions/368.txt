This is a track from New York rapper , Fabolous ' fifth studio album Loso 's Way .
The album was inspired by the 1993 Al Pacino film Carlito 's Way .
Fabolous explained to Billboard magazine : `` The concept of the album came from me watching Carlito 's Way and seeing how he was a guy who came from jail and wanted to do something bigger and better .
I did n't come from jail , but I came from the hood , and in many ways I felt just like Carlito , because even though I 'm still connected to the streets , I wanted to do bigger and better things too .
There were a lot of parallels between his story and mine . ''
This song samples Nas ' 1996 single `` The Message . ''
This song is titled after Carlito 's right-hand man , who betrays him at the end of the film .
Fabolous explained to MTV News : `` I got a song on the album called ` Pachanga . '
We say ` puh-chang-uh ' on the song .
That was Carlito 's man , but we know at the end of the movie that was the dude who got Carlito set up to get shot .
You see how friends change in due time .
I got a crazy joint on the album that explains how certain things or certain friends change in your lifetime . ''
