Kristinia said of this song about missing a distant lover : `` No matter how much you talk on the phone or text or e-mail , it 's just never the same as it is when you 're together in person and telling your man ' I miss you ' and ' I ca n't get you off my mind ' and ' I think about you morning , noon and night ' is very romantic .
I 'm definitely a hopeless romantic myself . ''
The song was co-written by Kristinia 's mentor , the R&B producer and songwriter Kenny `` Babyface '' Edmonds .
She told Artistdirect.com : `` Babyface helped me a lot , giving me certain situations to think about .
I had a boyfriend at the time , and he was like , ` Have you ever experienced being away from your boyfriend for longer than a week ?
Tell me what you felt . '
We just went from there .
I 'm not in a relationship right now , so I ca n't really relate to the song , but I 'm hoping I can go back to it when that time comes .
The songs I did with Babyface were for me .
He allowed me to have a lot of leverage , and I took advantage of that as much as I could . ''
Kristinia told Artistdirect.com that the song `` is basically about a long-distance relationship . ''
She explained : `` At the time , I had n't experienced that type of relationship but I knew that I would down the road .
I was n't sure how soon it was going to be , but I knew it would really break my heart .
Who likes long-distance relationships ?
No one .
That song was really for me though .
It 's something that I can go back to when I am in a relationship like that .
I just took from my experiences and what I had gone through in relationships and wrote from there . ''
