The song 's title was borrowed from a Terry Allen drawing that the wife of Country artist Guy Clark had given Emmylou a copy of .
However , the lyrics were inspired by the story of Emmylou 's own parents , career military officer Walter Harris and his wife Eugenia .
Walter Harris , was a member of the Marine Corps , who was reported missing in action in Korea in 1952 and spent ten months there as a prisoner of war .
She explained : `` I made up a story about a young couple who were separated and finally reunited .
It 's a tip of the hat to the experience I had as a child , though I ca n't imagine what my mother and father were actually going through .
I just saw this extraordinary love .
I do n't know what they went through to make it even stronger , but they were incredibly in love for 50 years .
That 's had a huge influence on me and this song was a roundabout way of telling a little bit of their story -- even though my father never had a tattoo . ''
