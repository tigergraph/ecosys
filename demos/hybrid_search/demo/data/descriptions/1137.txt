This is a track from The Performance , Dame Shirley Bassey 's first studio album of new songs in two decades .
English film composer David Arnold produced the entire set .
The Vatican listed this as one of the institution 's `` 12 Favorite Songs '' as part of their playlist on MySpace Music .
The other eleven songs include `` Don Giovanni '' by Mozart , the Vatican 's own `` Advocata Nostra , '' featuring the voice of Pope Benedict XVI , `` Uprising '' by Muse and surprisingly `` Changes '' by American rapper Tupac Shakur .
The Vatican explained on its official MySpace Music page : `` The genres are very different from each other , but all these artists share the aim to reach the heart of good minded people . ''
Each track was written by a different songwriter and this song was written by Richard Hawley .
Arnold told The Daily Telegraph October 28 , 2009 that he was determined to get a wide emotional range on the record .
He said : `` The thing that interested me most was to expose part of her personality she 's more reluctant to show publicly : the gentler , more fractured part which considers her feelings rather than the audience 's .
I remember playing her Richard Hawley 's ` After The Rain ' with just a string octet , bass drum and piano .
The musicians were playing beautifully and I was sitting beside her as she was singing along quietly .
I said , ` If you sing it like this , it could be quite special ' .
She was unsure , because that 's not her comfort zone .
It 's kind of Shirley laid bare . ''
