This was the title track from Nebraska indie rock band Cursive 's sixth album .
Frontman Tim Kasher said of Mama I 'm Swollen to Billboard magazine : `` My mom really hates this title .
It never really crossed my mind that it would be something she 'd take offense to .
-LRB- Mama -RRB- is just so universal ; it means so much more than your own mom , especially in rock 'n' roll .
She ended up liking the record , so I think that helps a little . ''
