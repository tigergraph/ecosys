Co-singer/guitarist Daniel Rossen recalled to Drowned in Sound : `` This song has actually stewed for ages and ages .
Originally came about while we were sleeping on someone 's floor a few years ago in Toronto .
The guy we stayed with had a guitar that was tuned really strangely , I think accidentally , and I sat around one morning on his porch and found parts of the song .
I played around with it for ages but it did n't work until I sat down with Ed -LRB- Droste -RRB- upstate and he helped flesh out the melody and lyrics and harmonies . ''
