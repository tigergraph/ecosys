Robbie Williams has a well-publicized interest in UFOs , so many Take That fans assumed that he is behind this song about extra-terrestrials .
However it turns out the tune was a joint effort between Gary Barlow and Mark Owen .
Said Barlow on his official website : `` This started as a backing track , went off to Mark 's house for the weekend and came back with this sing along anthem on top of it ! ''
The song features Take That 's Howard Donald on lead vocals .
