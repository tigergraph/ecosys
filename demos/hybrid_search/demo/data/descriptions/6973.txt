The Trouble album title came from all the band experiencing some sort of personal heartache during the making of this record .
This song is about the divorce that frontman Randy Rogers endured .
`` It was the most emotional thing that I 've ever been through , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` I wrote it down , and that was closure for me .
As a songwriter , I have that benefit of writing my feelings down , and putting that song out was a great closure to that chapter of my life .
I 'm very grateful to have music to do that for me . ''
