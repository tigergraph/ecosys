This is the second single from Sweet and Wild , the ninth studio album by American country artist Jewel .
She said on her website : `` Hands down my favorite message on the album .
This is up there with ` Hands , ' and ` Life Uncommon ' for me .
I really believe we do n't always know what it takes to be happy and satisfied .
Sometimes it 's simpler than we know : finding those you love and letting them know you do .
To me that is the definition of the word .
My favorite spot is the bridge ` horses are built to run , the sun was meant to shine above , flowers were made to bloom , and then there 's us - we were born to love . ' ''
Jewel told The Tennessean about the inspiration for the song : `` My husband -LRB- Ty Murray -RRB- and I have talked a lot about what is happiness and what makes a person happy .
It 's funny because I feel like we all are interested in happiness , but I feel like very few of us sit down to actually see how much we 're doing in our day lends to our happiness .
It also seems like when you 're a kid you have all these goals about what you want your life to become .
Now when you accomplish those goals , you have to re-evaluate and see if they are making you happy because what makes a person feel satisfied might be different than what you thought . ''
