Lead guitarist Will Nutter told The Alternative Press : `` Everyone has goals and dreams of where they see themselves five or 10 years from now .
This song is about my dream of having a house in the hills as a successful musician , having someone to share that with and enjoying everything life has to offer when you 've become successful . ''
This was previously released on Amber Pacific 's 2009 self-titled EP .
