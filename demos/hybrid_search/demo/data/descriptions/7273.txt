Taken by Trees is the solo project of Victoria Bergsman , the former lead vocalist for Swedish indie pop band , The Concretes .
This is the opening track from her second album , East of Eden .
The album was recorded in Pakistan and this track features the voice of local Sufi musician Sain Muhammad Ali .
Bergsman explained to the Sunday Times August 31 2009 : `` I asked him to sing about losing a friend and the translation of his lyrics was that he went to see a friend who did n't open the door to him .
Sain was so passionate , and he sang from the bottom of his heart . ''
