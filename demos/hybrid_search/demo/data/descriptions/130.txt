This is the first solo single to be released by Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry , since `` Simple Twist of Fate '' from his 2007 set of Bob Dylan covers , Dylanesque .
The song 's music video was directed by Jo Apps , the sister of English singer-songwriter Patrick Wolf , who is best known for her vocal contributions on various Big Pink tracks .
This features three different bass players , which Ferry told Pitchfork was `` a great indulgence . ''
He added : `` Marcus Miller is the main bass player , but then you have Mani from Primal Scream , who has a different kind of energy , and on the choruses Flea comes in .
I suppose it 's more sophisticated than you 'd normally get with three kids in a garage .
But it 's reached a point in my life where I have to do things I 've never done before . ''
The song is a collaboration with German producer/DJ/label head DJ Hell .
The pair first met up in 2006 when Hell visited Ferry 's studio in west London to discuss his desire to rework a Roxy Music song .
Eventually the duo decided to work on this track This is yet another Bryan Ferry song about dancing .
Others include his solo single Do n't Stop The Dance '' and Roxy Music 's `` Dance Away . ''
In response to Q magazine 's query as to why he 's written so many , Ferry replied : `` Music and dance are very closely entwined .
They go together . ''
Ferry told NME that he thinks Red Hot Chili Peppers ' Flea played the `` most expensive instrument known to man '' on this track . ''
-LSB- Flea -RSB- 's a big friend of '' -LSB- UK artist -RSB- Damien -LSB- Hirst -RSB- 's , '' Ferry explained .
`` When he was playing in the studio with us , he was playing the most incredible bass .
It was a Fender bass that Damien had customised .
It 's covered with butterflies , so it 's a kind of an artwork .
It 's possibly the most expensive instrument known to man . ''
