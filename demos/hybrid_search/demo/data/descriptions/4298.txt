Tommy Ramone -LRB- from Hey !
Ho !
Let 's Go !
The Ramones Anthology by David Fricke -RRB- : `` I wrote I Wan na Be Your Boyfriend because we had all these other songs with ' I Do n't Wan na ' - ' I Do n't Wan na Walk Around With You , ' ' I Do n't Wan na Go Down To The Basement . '
The only other positive song we had was Now I Wan na Sniff Some Glue .
One thing we all had in common was we were frustrated .
We escaped from our anger with humour .
A lot of that came from Dee Dee 's sensibility , this Dada sensibility that got squeezed into I Do n't Wan na . ''
There were some unusual instruments used on this song , including 12-string guitars , tubular bells and a glockenspiel .
Studio musicians were brought in to play them .
