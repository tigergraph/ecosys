Nazareth made this song a hit , but it was originally recorded by the Everly Brothers .
Roy Orbison also released it in 1961 as the B-side to his # 1 hit `` Running Scared . ''
Nazareth got its name from the first line of the Band 's `` The Weight '' - `` I pulled into Nazareth ... '' The band is from Scotland .
