Frontwoman Natalie Horler told Digital Spy about the song : `` As the title suggests it 's about the love of fire , but of course we 're not trying to promote that sort of thing !
The song basically is a play on words about heat - the heat in someone or the heat in me .
It 's about being obsessed with someone or something , so I guess it has a sexy undertone to it . ''
