This is the title track of the eighth studio album by American rock band Eels .
Recorded on an old four track tape machine by Eels leader Mark Oliver Everett in his Los Angeles basement , it 's a `` divorce album '' in which Everett equates his personal loss with the loss of integrity in the world he 's living in .
End Times is n't Everett 's first break-up album .
His 1993 solo album Broken Toy Shop recorded under his recording name E chronicled the broken heart of a young man in his twenties .
Noah and the Whale 's 2009 album First Days of Spring dealt with a similar subject matter from the perspective of a 20-year-old .
-LRB- check out `` Blue Skies '' -RRB- .
In this song , after encountering a mentally disturbed homeless man proclaiming the oncoming end of the world , Everett continues a walk through the Los Angeles night .
The `` End Times '' he speaks of is n't about `` Mayan calendar conspiracy theory bulls -- t , '' he explained in publicity materials , but , `` the state of the desperate times we live in .
The bottom line-ness of it all .
The end of common decency .
The loss of caring about doing a good job .
These are tough times .
Who can you trust ?
Walter Cronkite is just a ghost . ''
