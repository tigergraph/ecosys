This heartfelt ballad was inspired by the Perry siblings ' mom , Marie .
`` That was the most honest song we wrote for Pioneer , '' Kimberly Perry said to Billboard magazine .
`` We were relaxing , and going through some song ideas .
Neil had this one line written on his phone , ` If the world had a mother like mine . '
We are started to think about what the world would look like if our mother had raised it the way she raised us .
The opening line of the chorus says ` The wars would all be over , because she 'd raise us all as friends . '
Our mother is our personal hero .
We are her labor of love .
It 's our honor to our mother on Pioneer . ''
