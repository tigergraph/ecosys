This happy anthem written by Chris Stapleton and Adam Hood is about proudly doing as little as humanly possible .
`` This song takes me back to my first love , '' said Kimberly Schlapman .
`` It 's playful and spirited and a big ol' dose of feel-good .
It 's so much fun to sing in the live show .
We open it up with only vocals and it gets bigger and more rowdy as we go . ''
