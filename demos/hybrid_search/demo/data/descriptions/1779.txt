The video for this song and the main chorus -LRB- `` Back in the mud I 've been in , I confess , I 'm so happy here , there 's nothing you can do to make me stay away '' -RRB- show that the singer just ca n't pull himself away from the joy of playing football .
Sparxxx describes himself in the verses , which hints at a possible past in football .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Morristown , NJ -RRB-
