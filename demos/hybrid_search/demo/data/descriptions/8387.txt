This was released as a double a-sided single on December 19 , 2011 along with `` Staircase . ''
Both previously unreleased songs were taken from Radiohead 's The King of Limbs - From the Basement concert which was aired online and on a number of channels internationally , but not in the UK .
It was later released as a live video album on the same day as the single release .
In an interview on BBC Radio 1 , guitarist Ed O'Brien explained that this song had been `` kicking around for at least six years . ''
When Radiohead decided to perform it for the Live From the Basement concert , a final arrangement `` came together within a week . ''
During their October 8 , 2012 show at London 's O2 Arena , frontman Thom Yorke took an onstage potshot at the Daily Mail .
Introducing this song , he jokingly told the crowd that the journal was a `` quality newspaper '' before being forced to stop the song and start again as he was chuckling so much .
The song features a brass section arranged by Radiohead multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood .
As well as penning the soundtracks for such films as There Will Be Blood and Norwegian Wood , Greenwood also serves as `` composer-in-residence '' for the BBC Concert Orchestra .
The Daily Mail is a British middle-market tabloid newspaper , which is a bÃªte noire amongst left-wing circles due to its conservative editorial stance and its stories that are apparently intended to induce moral panic amongst its readers .
The Beatles described working for The Daily Mail as `` a steady job '' in `` Paperback Writer . ''
