At least in its most upfront interpretation , this is about child abuse .
In early interviews , lead singer Maynard James Keenan apparently was quite vocal about his dislike for his stepfather , and the video supports this theory quite well .
However , the autobiographical nature of this song is purely speculative .
This song is definitely about abuse , but not only from the perspective of the victim .
Throughout the piece the lyrics change from the frightening realization of what is happening to the individual to the insatiable appetite to force the same on another .
It is about the cyclical nature of abuse and the reason that certain learned behaviors are perpetuated .

-LRB- thanks , Landon - Effingham , IL , for above 2 -RRB- According to Tool guitarist Adam Jones in Revolver Magazine Presents Tool , `` Contractually , the record label was supposed to talk to us about any sort of publicity stunt they pulled on our behalf , especially with us paying for part of it .
But without telling us , they made little kid T-shirts for the single ` Prison Sex ' with our Tool wrench logo on there , which is actually a phallic symbol .
So the label was going to send the shirt to all the radio stations because Nirvana did that with one of their songs .
And we 're going , ` Well , first off , you did n't even talk to us about this . '
And they went , ` No , you do n't understand .
Nirvana did this and it was a huge hit with radio . '
And Maynard goes , ` Do you know what that song 's about ?
It 's about getting f -- ked in the ass as a little kid . '
They never sent the shirts out . ''
