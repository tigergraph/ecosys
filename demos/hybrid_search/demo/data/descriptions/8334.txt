Robert Plant wrote the lyrics about the state of the band at the time : they were not all getting along .
Jimmy Page and John Bonham were spending a lot of time together enjoying life as Rock Stars , while Plant and John Paul Jones were showing up on time and doing most of the work on the album .
As a result , the band was n't working together as much , but Page and Bonham were capable of working on their own and would add their parts when they did show up , usually very late at night .
The lyrics ended up getting drowned out in the mix , mostly by Page 's guitar , so they are very hard to understand .
Jimmy Page played a double-neck guitar on this .
Some of it is processed through a Gizmotron , a device that adds distortion .
The song reminded the band of something you might hear when riding on a carousel , hence the name of the song .
