This the title track of the American Alternative Metal band Sevendust 's ninth album .
The apocalyptic imagery of the Earth 's heat source burning out came to singer Lajon Witherspoon in a dream .
In our 2013 interview , he explained : `` It just stuck with me from a dream where I was running and the sun was going down , and I just felt like I had to get somewhere safe .
I think it was due to making a big move from Georgia to Kansas with my family .
For whatever reason I was sitting and I just kept singing , ` Black out the sun , the minute you started to run , ' and the melody kept coming in my head .
When we went to the studio , I still had that melody and those words in my mind . ''
Lajon adds that the unexpected passing of guitarist Clint Lowery 's father provided inspiration for this song , and that once it came together , the rest of the album fell into place .
`` Everything was just aligned right after that , '' he said .
`` It just trickled down a song a day , music a day , and then we started writing . ''
