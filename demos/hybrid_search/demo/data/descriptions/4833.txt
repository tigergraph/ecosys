This features R&B producer and songwriter Stephen `` Static Major '' Garrett , formerly of the group Playa , who tragically died on February 25 , 2008 at the age of 32 .
Static was Aaliyah 's main lyricist ; his writing credits for her included `` Rock The Boat , '' `` More Than A Woman '' and `` Try Again . ''
This was Lil Wayne 's 20th chart entry and first chart-topper .
Of those 20 , nine featured Wayne in a lead spot and eleven included Wayne in a featured role .
This song was the first of the nine featuring Lil Wayne in a lead spot to reach the Top 10 , let alone # 1 .
Billboard reported that the song was downloaded 183,000 times the week it hit # 1 .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- This was produced by Jim Jonsin , who recalled to Rhapsody working on this track : `` I originally made the track in a session for Danity Kane .
They passed on the record , and I went over and played it for Static .
He was working at my studio with Pleasure P from Pretty Ricky .
He had the melody within , like , 15 minutes .
He had the melody already down and he laid it .
He laid the hook .
It was probably about 30 minutes , he laid the hook and then they came out with the ` juicy for you ' part and then I sampled their vocals : -LSB- sings -RSB- ` Sh-sh-she lick me like a ... ' I sampled the little parts in the MPC drum machine and then I sampled the ` call me ' and just made it like I was scratching and it was done .
Static met up with Wayne and played it for him .
We used auto-tune , but with auto-tune , you ca n't just sing through it .
You got ta know notes .
So Wayne 's not just singing through some thing and it makes his voice sound perfect .
The way he used it , he did some neat s -- t with it .
He was singing all crazy with weird melodies that no one really does . ''
Tha Carter III became the first album to top one million sales in its debut week in the US since 50 Cent sailed past 1 million in 2005 with The Massacre .
Lil Wayne explained the album cover to Rolling Stone magazine : `` I just wanted to put my baby picture up there like Nas and Biggie did - all those albums when people did that , they were memorable , legendary albums .
You do n't forget those albums .
The tattoo idea came later .
I just thought it would be funny . ''
This topped the Billboard Hot 100 a few weeks prior to Katy Perry 's `` I Kissed a Girl . ''
Whilst Perry 's song created much controversy over it 's lyrics about bi-sexual experimentation , this ode to oral sex surprisingly escaped censure .
Static Major , who was credited as a featured artist , became the seventh performer to earn a posthumous US chart-topper , following Otis Redding -LRB- '' -LRB- Sittin ' On -RRB- The Dock Of The Bay '' -RRB- , Janis Joplin -LRB- `` Me And Bobby McGee '' -RRB- , Jim Croce -LRB- `` Time In A Bottle '' -RRB- , John Lennon -LRB- `` Starting Over '' -RRB- , the Notorious B.I.G. -LRB- `` Hypnotize '' and `` Mo Money Mo Problems '' -RRB- and Soulja Slim -LRB- `` Slow Motion '' -RRB- .
This was the best-selling digital single worldwide in 2008 .
Japanese singer Thelma Aoyama 's `` Soba ni Iru ne '' was the second best seller , followed by Flo Rida 's `` Low . ''
The song has provoked several lawsuits .
Jonsin claimed that he was owed half a million dollars in unpaid royalties for his work and rapper Dirahn Gilliams alleged the track uses portions of one of his musical work , `` Grindin Like A Goon '' without permission.Jonsin had come by an agreement with Wayne over his unpaid royalties by the end of 2010 .
He told Florida newspaper Broward Palm Beach New Times : `` We worked out an arrangement .
They 're giving me some money now , and will pay the balance in the first or second quarter next year .
I never had an issue with Wayne , he and I were cool .
It 's just there was some confusion owing to -LSB- clearance issues with -RSB- a sample from another song I made for him -LSB- `` I Feel Like Dying '' -RSB- .
There 's never been hard feelings between me and him . ''
Wayne told MTV News about the song 's video : `` I write the treatment to all my videos , and that one was pretty easy .
We tried to go with the whole ` Blues Brothers ' type of thing , just because I never shot a video where I 'm actually not rapping , so that was just enough in itself . ''
This topped the Billboard Hot R&B / Hip-Hop Songs chart .
It was the first rap single to reach # 1 on that particular listing since Ludacris ' `` Money Maker '' climbed to the summit in October 2006 .
Co-producer Deezle added in the same Rhapsody interview : `` We recorded it and we were listening back to it after .
I looked at Wayne and he was like , ` It 's cool ' I said , ` Man , I can bring this song home . '
I totally re-did the drums and changed the bassline that Jim had .
All my drums are harder than most people 's drums .
I gave it the bouncy feeling .
It was more sedated before .
That 's why the people dance like they do when the record comes on .
I brought it back to Wayne and he jumped up on the speakers and was excited and started doing the same dances he 's doing in the video and was like , ` That 's the next single .
I know we 're supposed to do ` Showtime , ' but we 're going to do this one . ' ''
Lil Wayne told Rolling Stone magazine how this song came together : `` My homeboy Static , the guy who 's on the song with me , it was all his idea .
He brought the song to me with his vocals already on there , the beat was already done and I just laid my vocals to it .
The decision to make it the single was evident right after I finished recording it .
Everybody in the studio knew this was the one .
We had some females in there and they were going crazy . ''
The lyrics draw inspiration from some other popular songs , including `` Candy Shop '' by 50 Cent -LRB- `` I 'll take you to the candy shop , I 'll let you lick the lollipop '' -RRB- , `` My Humps '' by Black Eyed Peas -LRB- `` Lovely lady lumps '' -RRB- and `` Drop It Like It 's Hot '' by Snoop Dogg .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- On the Billboard chart announced April 10 , 2008 this song rose 7-1 on Hot Rap Songs , the largest position leap and quickest move to # 1 this century to date .
