This song was written by the English singer-songwriter Nick Lowe , who is best known for his late 1970s hit tunes `` Cruel to Be Kind `` and '' -LRB- I Love the Sound of -RRB- Breaking Glass . ''
Lowe told Uncut magazine how the collaboration came about : `` I met Mavis when I was on tour with Wilco , '' he said .
`` Jeff Tweedy , who produced both her recent albums , asked me to write something .
I was raised and Anglican , I love gospel music and the language of the Bible , so it 's not a great leap , but I ca n't participate .
I heard Craig Ferguson say ' I am the sort of person who can be moved to tears in an empty church , but become an atheist in a full one , ' which I totally identify with . ''
