This song finds Alternative Rock singer-songwriter Rachael Yamagata attempting Hip-Hop .
She told Magnet magazine : `` I think my humor comes through on this album and that song .
People think I 'm super deep , and I am dark and like dark songs , but it allows me to be happier in my everyday life .
That was a song that has a lyric that 's truthful to who I am .
We had fun with it . ''
