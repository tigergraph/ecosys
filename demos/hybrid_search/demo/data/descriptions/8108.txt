Gallows frontman Frank Carter explained to Kerrang !
magazine April 18 , 2009 that the song 's title refers to `` big guy in the sky . ''
He added : `` This song is about my complete and utter confusion as to what Heaven is and whether it exists and in what capacity .
Preachers tell us that if you confess your sins , and ask for forgiveness , then all will be forgiven .
If that is the case , then as far as I am concerned , Heaven will be full of serial killers , rapists , pedophiles , cowards and traitors .
I would rather go to Hell and rot in fire and eternal damnation than spend time in Heaven with all the scum who have been forgiven for their sins . ''
