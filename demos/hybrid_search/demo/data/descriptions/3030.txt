This was The Pigeon Detectives ' first release .
It was issued as a limited edition , 1000 only copies single .
Guitarist Ollie Main explained to Q magazine June 2008 that he has a steady girlfriend and this song about a lad chatting up a girl was written in character rather than autobiographical .
He added : `` When I 'm writing I know the sort of cheesy chat-up lines lads would use .
It 's what happens in our world , but we 're not like that . ''
The recording on the album differs from the single version .
