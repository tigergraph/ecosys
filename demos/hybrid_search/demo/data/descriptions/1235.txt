This is the closing track on Californian alternative rock band Switchfoot 's seventh studio album , Hello Hurricane .
This was considered for inclusion in Switchfoot 's 2006 album Oh !
Gravity .
Lead singer Jon Foreman talked about this song on NewReleaseTuesday : `` So here we are at the end of the world .
And the beginning .
Here we are at the dawn of the next generation .
Y2K has passed us by .
MLK , Kennedy , Elvis , Lennon , Cobain , MJ ... they have all left the living .
They have left us searching , wondering , hoping ... I read the headlines , I watch the news .
Iraq , Rwanda , Iran , Darfur , Tibet , Columbine , OKC ... Towers falling , mothers , brothers , sisters , fathers ... passing from life to death .
We 're killing one another , destroying each other .
Sometimes the state of the world can bring a man to his knees .
It could make you cry .
I get angry .
I get overwhelmed .
I give up ... almost .
Sometimes , I find myself staring into a blood red dawn , still awake from the night before .
Still wondering why this new day has so much of the old darkness , the old sorrows , the old hatred .
I feel so alone .
I feel so alone in this world of pain.All my heroes are the ones who ran after the higher vision , the news that stays new .
We 've been chasing lesser gods , gods who do not know our names , gods who will die alongside of us .
The kingdom of the heavens does not come to us in our wealth , it comes to our in our poverty .
Our money , our knowledge , our medicine , our sex , our privilege - these are double-edged swords , dependent upon our own shaking hands for guidance .
With our two hands we build up and destroy , we hold and break the future .
My own hands are shaking .
I reach for the new day with fear and trembling .
I 'm reaching for a bird called hope , for the one true song who could bring me home .
I 'm waiting for dawn .
I 'm dreaming , reaching for the other side . ''
