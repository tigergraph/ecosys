Natalie Grant is a Contemporary Christian singer-songwriter who in the second half of the 2000s won four consecutive Dove Awards for best female artist .
This song is the opening track and second single from her seventh studio album , Relentless .
Grant told CCM magazine the story behind the song : `` I remember exactly where I was when I wrote this song .
I was reading the Bible and meditating on the scripture from Psalms that says , ` He will set your feet upon a rock and give you a firm place to stand . '
At that particular time , nothing felt firm .
It felt shifting , uncertain and unfair ; and my prayers felt as if they were just bouncing off the sky .
I 'm so grateful that God is not based on our feelings !
Things will often feel unsteady ; such are the times we are living in .
So many things seem uncertain , from the economy to the environment .
And though I often stumble and trip along the road of life , because of my faith , I am steady , regardless of how I feel.As I was meditating on the Scripture , I kept reciting the phrase , ' I will not be moved ' to myself .
Then the song just wrote itself .
I wrote it in about 20 minutes .
The songs I write that are worth anything always seem to happen that way!This song is pretty much my statement of faith .
Life is a journey of ups and downs , but in spite of ourselves , God never stops pursuing us .
And no matter what this culture is telling us -- how to act , how to look , what to believe -- this is my resolution : I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ .
And though I may get bumped and bruised along the way , I will not be moved from that.Because it was such a strong statement for me , I knew I wanted it to rock pretty hard .
I 'll never forget recording it .
I was 10 days away from delivering my twins .
Maybe that 's why I had a little extra aggression in my voice ! ''
