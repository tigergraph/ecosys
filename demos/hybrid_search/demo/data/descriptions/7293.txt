This is the title track of American Christian rock band Third Day 's tenth studio album and fourteenth overall release .
Frontman Mac Powell told Billboard magazine that he believes the record 's lyrics are lighter than on their previous release .
`` Revelation was more introspective , '' he said pointing to this track specifically .
`` In the chorus there is a question that says , ` Tell me , should I stay here or do I need to move ? '
We feel like the answer with this record is to do something about your faith and put your faith into action . ''
Powell said this song is aimed at people outside of the church . ''
` Make Your Move ' is definitely coming from the view of someone outside of the church saying , ` If this is really true , you need to prove this to me because right now I need something real in my life , ' '' he explained .
The song was premiered on September 11 , 2010 on ESPN , during the Alabama-Penn State college football game .
