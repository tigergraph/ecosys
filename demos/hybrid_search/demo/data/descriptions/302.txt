Aaron Lewis wrote all of the songs on his debut full-length solo release The Road except for this tune , which was penned by hit Nashville songwriters Dallas Davidson , Rhett Akins and Bobby Pinson .
Lewis heard the song when on a hunting trip with Akins and producer James Stroud .
He identified with the lyrics so much that he asked Akins for permission to record it , marking the first time the Staind vocalist had ever cut a song he did n't write .
