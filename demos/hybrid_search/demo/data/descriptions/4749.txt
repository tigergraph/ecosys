This song marked a turning point for Chicago : instead of horns and a Rock sound , it was Pop ballads and pianos .
The Roman numerals in their album titles -LRB- like Chicago XIV -RRB- also disappeared .
Chicago was one of the first Rock bands of the '70s to take on a softer , more keyboard-driven sound in the '80s .
They were followed by Yes -LRB- `` Owner Of A Lonely Heart '' -RRB- , Van Halen -LRB- `` Jump '' -RRB- and Heart -LRB- `` These Dreams '' -RRB- onto the charts with this new sound .
Steve Lukather , David Paich and Steve Porcaro of the group Toto all played on this track .
They were studio musicians before forming Toto .
-LRB- thanks , Heather - Middletown , OH -RRB- This was one of the few # 1 hits of the MTV era that did n't have a music video .
The first concept video Chicago made was for `` Stay The Night '' in 1984 .
Chicago vocalist Peter Cetera wrote this with David Foster , who also played piano on the track .
Foster worked on a similar song for Earth , Wind & Fire a few years earlier in `` After The Love Has Gone . ''
This featured at the conclusion of the 1982 Daryl Hannah movie Summer Lovers .
