This is a somewhat hardcore punk anthem .
It is all about `` rising above '' adversity and refusing to be controlled by society : `` We are tired of your abuse/Try and stop us , it 's no use/Society 's arms of control/Rise above/We 're gon na rise above . ''
In 2002 , former Black Flag front man , Henry Rollins , re-recorded this track with Public Enemy 's Chuck D for Rise Above : 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three .
The benefit album raised money to help fund the legal defence of The West Memphis Three - three men convicted of the 1993 murders of three boys in West Memphis , Arkansas - who many believe to be innocent .
Rollins told Ear Candy Magazine : `` I thought the trial was a joke and if I were in their place , I would hope someone would be looking out for me .
That 's why I stepped up to help out . ''
Iggy Pop , Ryan Adams , Ice-T and Faith No More front man , Mike Patton were among the other artists to contribute to the album .
This song features on Black Flag 's debut studio album , Damaged .
The version you hear on the album was intended for an earlier single release only .
During the Damaged sessions , Black Flag recorded a new version of `` Rise Above , '' but the band did not like it , so they decided to stick with the original .
