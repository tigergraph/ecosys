This tune is featured in the 2010 comedy film Scott Pilgrim Vs the World .
The wardrobe of Brie Larson , who plays The Clash at Demonhead 's lead singer in the movie , was inspired by photos of Metric vocalist , Emily Haines , in a live setting .
When the film 's director Edgar Wright and music supervisor Nigel Godrich learned the band was the inspiration for The Clash at Demonhead they asked Metric to contribute a song .
Haines told Spinner how this tune fits perfectly onto the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack .
`` Lyrically , musically , even the intro !
This song was exactly what Nigel and Edgar needed for the pivotal scene at Lee 's Palace .
Actress Brie Larson makes it her own in the film and sings it completely differently than me !
We 're proud to have the original Metric version on such a slamming soundtrack alongside T-Rex , the Stones , Beck , Black Lips and , of course , our pals Broken Social Scene . ''
Haines explained to Spinner how the song 's obscure lyrical content prevented it making Metric 's 2009 album , Fantasies . ''
` Black Sheep ' was always an unusual number .
It went through various road tests and revisions throughout the making of our album Fantasies .
It was a real banger live , but it did n't make the cut , mostly because no one , including me , could get a handle on what the hell the song was about .
I wrote the lyrics all at once in this full-on stream-of-consciousness moment and I could n't explain where all the imagery was coming from .
It was plucked from the unknown .
` Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend/You crack the whip , shape-shift and trick the past again . '
Come again ?
To make matters worse , I insisted that the song begin with a creepy chanting intro .
I had the whole band in the vocal booth whispering the words ` black sheep come home ' without knowing why . ''
