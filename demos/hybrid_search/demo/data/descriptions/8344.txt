This is the first single from Latin fusion collective Ozomatli 's fifth studio album , Fire Away .
The song features Hawaiian singer-songwriter Jack Johnson and warns against over consumption .
Speaking about the message of this song , Wil-Dog told us : `` You know , there 's so many ways that you can look at it .
But it 's really about , a guy that 's struggling with that .
Because in a capitalist society , the more money you have , the more power you have , and the more rewards for you .
Like , how much are you worth ?
I think that 's the funniest question .
` He 's worth over ten million dollars ! '
`` Ozomatli is from Los Angeles , and when we asked Wil if he encountered a lot of people in the entertainment industry who fit the description of the man in this song , he replied : `` You know what , most people in the entertainment business are not wealthy , and that goes for most people in any business .
There are very few that are .
L.A. gets a rap for being that place , but , L.A. 's made up of 95 % working class people , raising their families .
That 's what L.A. really is . ''
In our interview with Ozomatli bass player Wil-Dog Abers , he talked about how they hooked up with Johnson : `` We 've known Jack since Jack 's been making records , and we 've always been cool .
He has a studio called the Solar Power Plant here in L.A. that 's fully self-sufficient with solar panels .
It 's a green studio , if you will .
And we 're there all the time .
So he just happened to be next door editing a surf video , and he walked in and heard we were struggling with writing a song , and he came in and came up with a really beautiful chorus for it .
He 's like , ` I 've got an idea . '
It came out really natural . ''
Ozomatli take their name from the Aztecan word for the Aztec astrological symbol of the monkey , which is also a god of dance , fire , the new harvest , and music .
