This pogo-pop belter is one of a clutch of uptempo songs on A Curious Thing and is typical of the bigger sound of the tracks on the album , compared with MacDonald 's first release .
`` That 's because I 've just toured constantly , ' she explained in publicity materials , ` and just spent all that time with my band , who are all amazing musicians , who spend their spare time on the stage jamming to anything .
We 've actually done the most ridiculous things , like spending ages making reggae versions of the whole first album !
Those experiences made me think we could get in a lot of instruments and make this really big-sounding album . ''
A Curious Thing was recorded at Paul Weller 's Black Barn Studios .
The Modfather plays guitar on this track and also plays bass on `` This Pretty Face . ''
Macdonald explained to Contactmusic.com : `` I supported Paul Weller back in 2007 , and I think that was probably the first tour that I did .
He was just really nice .
He stayed in touch , and even came to a few of my shows .
He said to my manager that if we ever needed a studio to record in we could use his .
So this album was actually recorded in his personal studio .
It was just incredible .
It had all of his memorabilia and awards there .
It was just so much more inspiring being somewhere like that which had all of these things on the wall . ''
MacDonald identified this song as `` one of those kooky album tracks that keeps the flow going along . ''
