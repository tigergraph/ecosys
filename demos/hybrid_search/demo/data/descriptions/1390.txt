Frontman Jason Stollsteimer told Rolling Stone that this song was n't written with a wedding theme in mind , but it wound up having special significance .
He explained that it was written two years before the recording of Love Hate And Then there 's You .
`` It was n't about marriage or anything , but right after we recorded that I got divorced .
I did n't mean anything about that , but now I guess its kind of ironic . ''
