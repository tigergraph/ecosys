We Could n't Think of a Title was the first album from Psychostick , who is a comedic metal band from Tempe , Arizona .
Their guitarist Josh Key told us about this track : `` Two Ton Paperweight is a funny song about a car that causes the driver endless misery .
But at the time , it was far from funny .
I had just moved to Phoenix and had not found a job yet when the car decided to have everything in the world go wrong with it .
The brakes went first .
A hose to the radiator cracked .
The A/C died .
The car ended up undriveable before finding a job in a city I just moved to .
Bad timing for a vehicle to decide to die on you .
I ended up getting up at 4am every morning to catch a 2 hour bus ride to work . ''
