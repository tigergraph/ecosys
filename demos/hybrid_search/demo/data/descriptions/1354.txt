This song sounds similar to Take That 's 2006 UK chart-topper `` Shine . ''
Allen admitted to the Observer Music Magazine December 2008 that she was aware of this , `` but I did n't know when we wrote it . ''
She added : `` Greg -LRB- Kurstin , producer -RRB- just played the chords and I sang and we were like , ` That 's great , really hooky . '
Then when we played it back to someone , they pointed it out that it was , essentially , ` Shine . ' ''
Allen asked Take That to sing on it , they turned down the offer but allowed her to use the tune as they liked the song .
