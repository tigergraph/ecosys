In this song Otto visits the emotions a parent prays never to experience in a tribute to St. Jude Children 's Hospital in Memphis .
Otto co-wrote this touching ballad with Monty Criswell .
He told AOL 's The Boot about the story behind the song : `` That song was written about a friend of Monty 's whose child was diagnosed with cancer .
He asked me if it was something that would be too heavy to write about .
I related it to my mother-in-law -LSB- who had -RSB- breast cancer and how it affected me -- I was so afraid when it happened .
You put it in reverse and go , ` How hard would it be to see your child go through cancer ? '
It 's horrible .
I ca n't imagine anything worse .
So we tried to put ourselves in the position of being a father , what would you be going through .
I ended up going to St Jude -LSB- Children 's Research Hospital -RSB- a few years later and got to know some of the kids and doctors and see what they do there .
I really found a reason to put the song on my record while I was there .
I did n't have any experience with it necessarily until then , so it really took hold there . ''
