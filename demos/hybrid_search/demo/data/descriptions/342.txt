This club jam is the second single by American R&B singer Chris Brown 's fourth studio album , titled F.A.M.E. Brown posted a link to the song via his Twitter account at midnight on New Year 's Day , January 1 , 2011 , making it the first new song of the 21st century 's second decade .
It was then made available for download in the United States on February 1 , 2011 .
The album title stands for `` Forgiving All My Enemies , '' and is named after a tattoo Brown got in July 2010 .
The song 's music video was shot in Los Angeles on February 16 , 2011 with director Colin Tilley , who had previously helmed the visuals for `` Yeah 3x '' and `` Deuces '' .
`` That 's my first rap kind of video , '' Brown told MTV News .
`` And I wanted to do old school ; well , not old school , but like back in the day , when I was growing up as a kid .
The '90s feel and big , baggy clothes .
It 's abstract , a lot of art and graffiti .
I tried to blend it all as one to make it exciting .
`` Some of the frames feature Brown clad in the Brooklyn cap and glasses that Spike Lee 's character , `` Mars Blackmon '' , wore in the Air Jordan ads .
`` I kind of did the Mars Blackmon outfit with the Brooklyn -LSB- hat -RSB- and the whole -LSB- outfit -RSB- , I always was a fan of that and that was always fresh to me when I saw Spike Lee with Jordan , '' Brown explained to MTV News .
`` So I was like , man , I ` mma do that outfit just to pay tribute to him . ''
Colin Tilley told MTV News how the video was created : `` I remember when we first got the song and Chris sent it to us : It was the first time I had heard the song , and it was so crazy to me , '' he recalled .
`` Before we do every video , I always talk to Chris to kind of feel where he 's going with the song and just where his motivation was with the song , and he actually sent me this one YouTube link ... It was this little '80s clip of these hip-hop dancers dancing.I would play it to the actual song , and at one point of the song , there were all these dancers dancing on these street elements like benches and tables and stuff like that , '' he continued .
`` From there , it just started to evolve from street elements and this whole underground vibe to just getting crazier and crazier .
I wanted to make sure it was really exciting . ''
The song features Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes and finds Brown rapping with the two hip hop heavyweights , as he does throughout his mixtapes .
In an interview just before headlining Wild 94.9 's annual Wild Jam holiday concert in San Jose , California , Breezy said of his rapping : `` It 's actually fun .
I just try to play with it .
I do n't consider myself a rapper .
I 'm just having fun with music . ''
The song was produced by the Philadelphia producer , Diplo .
According to Dutch producer Afrojack , the song is the product of a beat he passed along to Diplo .
In an interview with MTV News , he said `` Diplo called me ... -LSB- and -RSB- he was like , ` We are in the studio right now , and we are gon na do a track on the beat . '
And I was like , ` OK , whatever .
Have fun . ''
`` Busta 's verse on it is really sick , '' he continued .
`` It 's like I ca n't even hear what he said , but I love the part where he goes -LSB- mimics Busta 's rapid flow -RSB- , and then pauses and goes rapping really quickly .
And I do n't know how to do it , I do n't even try .
But it was really , really cool . ''
Better known as an R&B singer , Chris Brown achieved his first # 1 on Billboard 's Rap Songs chart as a lead artist with this tune .
Back in 2006-07 , Brown was a featured artist , along with Johnta Austin , on Bow Wow 's seven-week Rap Songs chart-topper `` Shortie Like Mine . ''
Plenty of MCs were looking at Brown after the song spent 10 weeks at the top spot on Billboard 's Rap songs chart .
The boastful track was Billboard 's # 1 rap song of 2011 .
