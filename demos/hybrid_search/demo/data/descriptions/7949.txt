This track from Dizzee 's mixtape Dirtee TV.com - The Mixtape EP , Vol .2 sees the rapper down with hard drugs and up with the bass line .
The song 's music video sees Dizzee take on the role of a white-suited preacher along with comedian sidekick Eric Lampaert , as they preach the religion of bass to the community .
French directing quartet MegaForce directed the clip .
`` The way the hook is sung , especially with the back vocals , led us naturally to the preaching stuff , '' said Leo and Raphael of Megaforce to Promo News .
`` We 've wanted to address the subject of religion for a while , and as the track is funny and light here , we approached it in a comedy way .
It was an opportunity to focus on the comedy acting and to make Dizzee 's performance part of the main idea and not something aside an unrelated story . ''
