This was originally intended to be the first single from the re-released and newly packaged version of English singer-songwriter Diana Vickers debut studio album , Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree .
However , the plans were scrapped and it was revealed instead it would serve as the first single from her second album .
It was debuted on BBC Radio 1 's The 5:19 Show on September 12 , 2010 .
The music video was filmed in Los Angeles , United States in mid September 2010 .
Vickers told Digital Spy the song is about sexual attraction .
She explained : `` It 's all about when you 're really , really attracted to somebody and you really , really want them and just fancy the pants off them .
Even if you know that they 're with somebody else or you 're with somebody else , when they 're around it 's just like ` Ahh ! '
and you just wan na havethem .
It brings out this wicked side in you . ''
The track was co-written by Vickers and songwriter Dee Adams and produced by James Earp .
Speaking on a live Ustream chat with fans , the singer said : `` I 've been working with this really great writer Dee Adams and a really , really great producer called James Earp .
I went into the studio and was mooching around and we ended up writing ` Wicked Heart . ' ''
Vickers was asked in an interview with Digital Spy about the similarities between this tune and The Red Hot Chili Peppers 1992 song , `` Under The Bridge . ''
She replied : `` Yeah , that happened without even knowing .
We wrote the song in an hour .
We had the song and it did n't have the ` My Wicked Heart ' bit in it and then we put the vocal in and we were like , ` Why does it sound so familiar ? '
Then we realised it was because we were listening to ` Under The Bridge ' the day before .
`` She then went on to admit : `` We were saying , ` Should we change it ?
Should we not ?
What should we do ?
Sod it , no , we 're just gon na keep it , it works ' . ''
