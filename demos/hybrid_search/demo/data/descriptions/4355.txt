Jim Steinman , who wrote Meat Loaf 's hits , wrote this for the 1984 movie Streets Of Fire .
The movie , which got its title from the Bruce Springsteen song , stars Diane Lane as a young singer with dreams of stardom .
The song captures her restless energy as she sings about getting away but not caring about where she goes , as long as she goes there fast .
Steinman also wrote the song `` Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young '' for the movie .
Also appearing on the soundtrack was `` I Can Dream About You , '' which was a hit for Dan Hartman .
Fire Inc. is a studio group created to play the songs in the movie .
While Diane Lane mimed this in the movie , the vocals were done by Holly Sherwood , who has appeared on many of Jim Steinman 's productions and sang backup on tracks by Barbra Streisand , Billy Joel and Barry Manilow .
Other musicians in Fire , Inc. include Rick Derringer , Max Weinberg and Davey Johnstone .
Meat Loaf also recorded this song , which appears on his 1984 album Bad Attitude .
