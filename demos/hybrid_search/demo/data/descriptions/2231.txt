This was used as the title to a 1984 movie .
The producers hoped Springsteen would let them use this song , but he refused .
The movie , which starred Diane Lane as an aspiring Rock star with big dreams , had many of the same themes found in Springsteen 's music .
For the movie , big-time songwriters and studio musicians were used to create the soundtrack , which contained the Dan Hartman hit `` I Can Dream About You '' and `` Nowhere Fast , '' which was written by Jim Steinman and contains some very Springsteen-esque lyrics : `` There 's nothin ' wrong with goin ' nowhere , baby , but we should be goin ' nowhere fast . ''
Springsteen 's drummer Max Weinberg played on that track .
