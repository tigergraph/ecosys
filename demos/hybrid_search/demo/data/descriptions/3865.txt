This is the opening track from the English Alternative Rock band Arctic Monkeys third album , Humbug .
The song was released as the LP 's third single and the 10 '' vinyl , which features three new b-sides , was sold exclusively at Oxfam charity stores .
Many fans have interpreted the song title as a double-entendre and Alex Turner 's lyrics to be of an uncharacteristically sexual nature .
The Arctic Monkeys lyricist and chief songwriter denied this interpretation of the song 's meaning to The London Times : `` Absolutely not , '' Turner said .
`` If that was a euphemism , then I would n't be saying that my propeller would n't spin - ` cos you would n't wan na go shouting that out , would you ?
`` When pressed as to what the song is really about , he added : `` It 's more describing a mood more than an organ .
A descent .
It 's about a descent . ''
Turner refused to elaborate any further .
