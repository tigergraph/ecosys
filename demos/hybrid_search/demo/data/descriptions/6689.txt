After Jessie provided guest vocals on David Guetta 's Nothing But The Beat track , `` Repeat , '' the French DJ/producer repaid the English singer-songwriter by teaming up with her for this high energy track .
The song was recorded for the platinum edition of her debut album Who You Are .
London-based songwriting and production team , The Invisible Men , produced the song .
The trio comprises former members of the American rock band Orson , Jason Pebworth and George Astasio and one time member of Xenomania Jon Shave .
The threesome previously collaborated with Jessie J on her debut hit , `` Do It Like a Dude '' and their other credits include Conor Maynard 's debut single , `` Ca n't Say No . ''
When the song climbed to # 5 in its second week on the UK singles chart , Jessie became the first UK female artist to score six Top 10 singles from the same album .
Previously , only Take That , Lady GaGa , Katy Perry and Michael Jackson had managed the feat .
