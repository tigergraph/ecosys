This song was co-written by Take That 's Gary Barlow .
Fazar from N-Dubz told The Sun November 13 , 2009 about writing with the multi Ivor-Novello Award winning songwriter : `` He was great , we were so grateful to him for taking time out with the underdogs .
Gary was very funny and down to earth .
In the evening we had a curry and he ended up staying the night at our studio .
He was sleeping in the next bedroom and we kept thinking : ` Oh my god , Gary Barlow is next door . ' ''
