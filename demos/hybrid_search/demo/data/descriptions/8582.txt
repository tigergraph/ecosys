This is the closing track of American indie band , Darwin Deez 's sophomore album , Songs For Imaginative People .
Darwin Deez leader Darwin Smith explained to NME that `` an old friend who suddenly seemed like more inspired this song . ''
He added that upping sticks and leaving New York for Asheville in his home state of North Carolina was the catalyst for Songs For Imaginative People .
Subconsciously he `` felt like a carpetbagger , '' he said `` taking advantage of its `` awesomeness , not needing a job outside of music , hanging with young adults and relaxing in the mountainous beauty . ''
