This tender ballad was written for her son , Wyatt , whom Crow adopted in 2007 .
Said Crow : `` The best thing I can do for my son is to raise him with love .
I want him to grow up in a loving environment and go be who he wants to be .
You always want to protect your children .
But you have to let go one day and hope they 'll succeed and remember their upbringing . ''
Despite this being written for him , Crow recalled in USA Today that this was not young Wyatt 's favorite track from the album : `` We went out on the road when he was around 4 months old .
And whenever he would get a little fussy , we would just put on ` Shine Over Babylon ' and he 'd go straight down . ''
Crow then added he was n't interested in hearing the quieter `` Lullaby for Wyatt , '' instead `` he wanted to hear something loud and boisterous ! ''
