This was co-written by Lee Ann Womack .
AOL asked the Country singer if this song was really her through and through .
She replied : `` For better or worse , I guess it is , yes .
You 're really exposing yourself and throwing yourself out there when you put your own songs on there , especially when they 're as raw as something as ` Have You Seen That Girl . '
Nobody wants to look foolish . ''
The song contains the lyric , `` Where along the way did I lose me . ''
Womack explained to AOL : `` How many women do you know who have thought that ?
I think you reach a certain point where you feel that way .
You may even be better off than you were before , but you feel like you 've lost some of who you were before . ''
