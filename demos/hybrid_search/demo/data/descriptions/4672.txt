This song is about Frank Zappa 's teenage years in Lancaster , California .
The area was filled with turkey farms and is still prone to vicious sandstorms .
In the tiny town of Sun Village -LRB- which was almost entirely Black and Latino and was mostly burned to the ground during race riots in the late 1960s and early 1970s -RRB- , Zappa and some friends formed a group called `` The Black-Outs , '' which played at a place called `` The Village Inn & Barbecue '' on Palmdale Boulevard .
There was always a crowd of drunken individuals who would dance in a stumbling manner , all of which are mentioned in the song .
The song was not sung by Zappa - his saxophonist and flute player Napoleon Murphy Brock sang sang it .
-LRB- thanks , Darrell - Eugene , Oregon , for above 2 -RRB-
