Gloriana 's Mike Gossin penned this song about a time earlier in his music career when he was struggling to make ends meet .
During those dark days he was reliant on his brother for a place to rest at night until love transformed his circumstances .
`` Before Gloriana , I was living in North Carolina , '' Gossin recalled to Billboard magazine .
`` I was broke .
I did n't have a car .
I was sleeping on Tom 's couch .
I was pretty down and out and just getting by playing acoustic gigs with Tom making like $ 50 a night .
I was in a rut thinking , ` Is anything ever going to happen ? '
The song is about meeting somebody who changed my point of view about the situation and pulled me out of that bad place and saved me . ''
