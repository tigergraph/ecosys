This song , as represented during their 2007 tour , talks about the divide between the rich and the poor .
Namely , how those born into wealth have more opportunities than those born into poverty .
-LRB- thanks , Chris - Spencerport , NY -RRB- The song is in the form of a pantoum , which is a fairly obscure poetry structure .
Chapter 5 of Neil Peart 's travelogue publication entitled The Masked Rider : Cycling in West Africa -LRB- 1996 -RRB- is titled `` The Larger Bowl '' and it refers to the title of a song from a dream he had at the Happy Hotel in Cameroon in 1988 while on a cycling tour with 4 others .
Neil suffered dysentery and had a `` weird dream '' about an armored helicopter carrying him from Toronto into the back of a truck , which drove him to Halifax through a tunnel under the Atlantic Ocean .
He was there to do an interview , but instead he found himself in a clothing store doing a phone interview with a guy named Fletcher .
A song was playing in the store , a ballad called `` A Larger Bowl '' - The song was about loneliness and the misfortunes in life .
He could not recall ever hearing of this song before .
`` But I like the title '' he said.Neil also refers to , in this book , the baskets woman carry on their heads in West Africa , they are carrying the bulk of the loads `` The Larger bowls . ''
Still another reference he used in The Masked Rider is in regards to an incorrigible young boy -LRB- Le Petite Patron -RRB- who snatched candy away from one child and then tormented another child until he relented to share his .
Neil thought that it was obvious who had `` The Larger Bowl here . ''
The lyrics speak of the differences of peoples fortunes and fate .
This is a resounding reference in The Masked Rider book , where Neil recognized the clear difference between poverty and despair versus poverty and a simply life in West Africa .
