This is about the fear that rules all of us in one way or another , in particular the fear of love .
The hounds of love that are hunting you is imagery for love itself as something to be feared , to run away from lest it catch you and rip you up .
At the same time , it says that perhaps the hounds are friendly and one should not fear love -LRB- `` I 've always been a coward , and never know what 's good for me '' -RRB- .
The title track from Bush 's most commercially successful CD , this was one of the songs from the first portion of the album of which 4 songs had UK chart success .
The first 5 songs are very much separate pieces -LRB- `` Running Up That Hill , '' `` Hounds of Love , '' `` The Big Sky , '' `` Mother Stands for Comfort '' and `` Cloudbusting '' -RRB- .
Of these 5 , only `` Mother Stands For Comfort '' was not a hit .
The last 7 songs are a conceptual suite written to be one piece of music .
A remaster of the album was released in 1996 with 4 additional songs from the same period .
-LRB- thanks , Lee - Ottawa , Canada -RRB- The song was inspired in part by an old black and white movie which was sort of a cult classic in Kate 's family titled Night Of The Demon .
The movie was about demons who hid waiting in trees - the song 's opening line -LRB- in a male voice -RRB- `` It 's coming !
It 's in the trees ! ''
is taken directly from the movie .
The album was recorded in a windowless studio that Bush had constructed in a converted barn near her parents ' house in semi-rural East Wickham , south east of London .
Kate Bush -LRB- from Q magazine -RRB- : `` People commented on how the album seems very elemental .
And I ca n't help but put quite a lot of that down to the fact that I moved out into the country .
The visual stimulus coming in was that of fields and trees , and seeing the elements doing their stuff . ''
