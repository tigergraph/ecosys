This track was influenced by Roth 's two older sisters and the rapper 's distaste for disrespecting women .
He explained to MTV News : `` It 's an ode to my girls that just want to go out and have a good time and do n't want some sleazy dude all over them . ''
This was released as the third single from rapper Asher Roth 's album , Asleep in the Bread Aisle .

The song features R&B singer-songwriter Keri Hilson .
Roth explained to MTV News that when the song was being put together , `` we pretty much put together your dream-team list of artists that you would love to collaborate with on that song . ''
He added : `` And Keri was a friend that was in Atlanta with us , and we had met early on , and we were talking about working together .
So when we put together our dream list , she was on the top of it .
We sent -LSB- the song -RSB- over to her , and she absolutely murdered it . ''
