In this song Jackson sings about his love of fishing .
He told The Boot : `` I almost like being on the water and the boats , more than I do the fishing .
But the fishing gives me a good excuse to be out on the ocean .
I do n't freshwater fish as much as I used to .
Years ago , I did bass fish a lot .
I got into offshore fishing 15 years ago , and I 've fished everywhere most people do that , in the Bahamas and off of Florida in the Keys and Mexico and the Virgin Islands . ''
