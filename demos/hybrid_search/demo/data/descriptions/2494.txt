This was released as the third single from American R&B singer , Tyrese 's fifth studio album , Open Invitation .
The song finds Tyrese singing about how jealousy can get in the way of a otherwise happy relationship and the singer told The Boombox that he believes many men can identify with the song 's lyrics .
He explained : `` I 've been around long enough and have been in my share of relationships with very attractive women , and the more beautiful you are , in most cases , the more insecure you are .
You may have opened up your heart to someone and they did wrong by you , cheated on you , whatever the case may be , you just find yourself carrying that baggage from one relationship to the next .
And as a man you feel the need to give that reassurance , to give her that confidence and say , ` These women ai n't got nothing on you .
If I wanted to be with someone else then I would . ' ''
The video for the song features Chilli from TLC as Tyrese 's leading lady .
He told The Boombox that he has known Chilli for many years and she 's a good friend of his .
`` I think there are only so many female entertainers left who are sweet , innocent , not jaded , who have natural beauty without implants and assistance , '' Tyrese added .
`` Does n't matter what camera angle you shoot them at , they 're just beautiful , and that 's who she is to me .
And the fact that we already had a rapport and an energy about us , I just thought she was the perfect girl for the video .
Things got real heated on the set , but we were just doing out jobs . ''
