This celebration of life 's little moments contains the lyric , `` Breathe before your breath runs out . ''
Francesca Battistelli told American Songwriter magazine : `` Ben Glover and I were writing this song about noticing the simple things in life and slowing down in enough time to appreciate them .
We needed that perfect line to take us into the chorus , and I just said this out loud .
It was just right . ''
