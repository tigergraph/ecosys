Violinist Davide Rossi worked with Coldplay on both Viva La Vida and the Prospekt 's March EP .
He told Coldplaying.com that this tune , `` for a certain period , was made as a song just for strings and voice , a bit like ` Eleanor Rigby ' , but then it became a more complete song and it 's a ` collage ' of different sessions . ''
