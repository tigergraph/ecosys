This song refers to famed British occultist Aleister Crowley .
Prefix Magazine asked vocalist/keyboardist James Righton if the band were practitioners of black magic .
He replied : `` We 're not occultists , we do n't practice magick .
It 's just a case of not writing about reality and nine-to-five jobs and the usual things that bands write about , of just writing about the fantastical and getting some ideas into pop music that are n't usually seen there or have n't been there for awhile .
Just playing with things and seeing what we could do .
But it naturally came out like that .
It was never really forced .
It 's just what we do , what we write about . ''
