On this smutty , Caribbean flavoured track Rihanna sings about having a sexual rendezvous with her love interest .
Rihanna told Q magazine January 2010 this song is `` about the kind of street , bad boy that girls sometimes like .
There 's a danger and a swagger there . ''
`` Rude '' is Jamaican slang for `` cool , hip '' and the phrase `` rude boy '' was used in Jamaica in the 1960s to describe a snappily dressed ska fan .
According to The Cassel Dictionary of Slang , the term came to be applied to any `` young , Black Jamaican male who is an aggressive social dropout . ''
This was Rihanna 's sixth Hot 100 # 1 and fifth as a lead artist , having been a featured vocalist on T.I. 's `` Live Your Life '' in 2008 .
Regarding this song hitting # 1 Rihanna told Entertainment Weekly : `` It 's so exciting .
I ca n't believe ` Rude Boy ' of all songs was the biggest song on this album , and that 's the one that I really wrote the most on . ''
Ester Dean discussed writing this song for Rihanna during an interview with The Boombox : `` She 's just fierce .
When I 'm in the recording booth and I 'm wining it up on ` Rude Boy , ' I 'm channeling who she is .
I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks wo n't say .
Even if she says let 's go kiss some girls , who really cares ... that 's Rihanna .
Music is about fantasy .
This is what people want to do , but are afraid to do .
My sex life is much more prude than the sex life I write about -LSB- laughs -RSB- .
I use Rihanna 's alter ego as inspiration .
That 's why people loved ` Rude Boy ' because that sound was n't out .
The fans are tired of the same old things .
People are thirsty for something that 's new . ''
The Stargate produced song was co-written by singer-songwriter Ester Dean .
At the time of Rated R 's release , Dean was in the Hot 100 with her own song , `` Drop It Low , '' which ironically features Rihanna 's former boyfriend , Chris Brown .
This was released as the third single from Rihanna 's Rated R .
The single 's cover art shows the Barbadian singer wearing nothing but a pair of black boots and a top hat .
She is hiding her modesty behind a long board with `` Rude Boy '' written on the front .
The pop-art-inspired video that appears to include every color in the Crayola box was directed by Melina Matsoukas , who also helmed the clip for `` Hard . ''
It features Rihanna in a selection of Caribbean dance-hall-inspired costumes ranging from a zebra print bodysuit to a multi-colored miniskirt and black halterneck .
The Barbadian singer told Carson Daly on his Amp Radio show : '' -LSB- It 's -RSB- completely different from any other video I 've shot before .
A lot of my videos are really dark and edgy and tough .
` Rude Boy ' is more playing along the lines from my roots .
We used a lot of color , but also the costumes were very Jamaican dance-hall-queen type . ''
The song was the 11th US chart-topper to contain the word `` boy '' in its title .
The previous one to do so was Soulja Boy Tell 'em 's `` Crank That -LRB- Soulja Boy -RRB- '' in 2007 .
Rihanna 's gender , however , maintains a secure lead in # 1 representation .
As at the date this tune reached the summit , 21 songs sporting `` girl '' in their titles had led the Hot 100 .
The song was co-written and co-produced by Rob Swire , who is the front man of Australian drum and bass outfit Pendulum .
The band have achieved a great deal of success not only in their homeland but also in the UK where their 2010 set Immersion topped the album charts .
