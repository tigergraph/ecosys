Noah and The Whale close their Heart Of Nowhere album with this contemplative cut , which frontman Charlie Fink chose an under-rehearsed take to give added immediacy .
`` With all our records I hope there 's some level of journey from beginning to end -- the whole is greater than the sum of its parts , '' he explained to The Independent . ''
-LSB- The record -RSB- starts out with a melodramatic , angst-ridden story , about a kid wanting to break away from his family and be someone new , and it evolves into the last song about acceptance . ''
Fink told Q magazine that this song `` focuses on that idea of finding your own way to be a man . ''
