Written on frontman Roy Stride 's iPod Touch , this love song is one of four new songs featured on a Bonus Track Edition of British band Scouting For Girls 's second album , Everybody Wants To Be On TV .
It was released as a single on July 10 , 2011 .
The Jonnie Malachi directed music video tells a bittersweet tale of love rivalry between a geek and a bad boy from a young age .
The director told Promo News that the casting of the lead parts worked out well .
He said : `` The ` little badboy , ' Eric Dibb Fuller , has actually been playing the Artful Dodger in the West End version of Oliver ! .
It was also really lucky that we could find the younger and older versions of the main roles looks-wise .
I had also just photographed the comedian Eric Lampaert for his Edinburgh comedy festival posters , so had him squarely in mind for older geek .
I wanted this to be ` bittersweet ' -- and hopefully it has the right balance of cute sweetness , with some luvverly heartbreaking dark undertones . ''
