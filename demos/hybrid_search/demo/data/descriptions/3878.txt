Ace Frehley : `` I love ` Strange Ways . '
I just came up with the riff .
It was one of those inspired , heavy tunes .
I did n't feel comfortable as a singer at that point .
Gene and Paul are very intimidating people .
A lot of the time they tend to make people feel inadequate .
It took me a while to get over my feeling of inadequacy .
I did n't think I was as good a singer as I am .
It took me a while to come out of my shell .
Whenever I wrote songs in the early days , I 'd always ask Peter -LRB- drummer Peter Criss -RRB- to sing so he would get some of the spotlight .
I was n't that secure with myself as a singer around Gene , Paul and Peter .
They were all confident lead singers and even though I knew I could sing , they did n't encourage it , so , I just kind of laid back .
` Strange Ways ' was never performed live by KISS .
I had forgotten just how heavy it was .
One of my favorite guitar solos is the one on ` Strange Ways ' .
It was done in one take .
I just closed my eyes and that 's what came out .
Usually , I record in the control room , but for that solo I went out and stood in front of the amp and got that wild feedback bend at the beginning .
It sounded like a dinosaur . ''
Peter Criss : `` Ace wrote it and I sang it .
It was really different for me , really heavy and new .
I 'd never sung anything like it , it was n't exactly R&B .
It was a great challenge to me and I loved it . ''
-LRB- thanks , Ken - LaSalle , Canada , for above 2 -RRB-
