In this song the delay is synched to the tempo .
In the November , 1991 issue of Guitar Player magazine , Alex Lifeson explained : `` I did it originally , then Stephen -LRB- the engineer -RRB- added a little bit more DDL to one of the other cleaner guitars to give it more energy .
The song seemed quite same as we went through different sections - something was lacking .
We wanted to get the first verse seesawing a little more .
Edge , from U2 , is a pro at that . ''
