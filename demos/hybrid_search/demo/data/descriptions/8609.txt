Lyrically this song concerns an extremely attractive man who is trouble for Britney , but she just ca n't resist .
The song was co-written and produced by Fraser T Smith , a producer best known for his collaborations with British pop R&B acts such as Taio Cruz , Clare Maguire and Pixie Lott .
He started his career as the guitarist in veteran prog-rocker Rick Wakeman 's touring band .
The observant amongst you will have noticed that Britney did not have any writing credits on Femme Fatale , for which the singer was criticized in the media .
Songwriter Heather Bright , who co-penned this song , came to Britney 's defense and wrote on her blog : `` Britney could have come to me , like all these other A-list artists , and said ` Hey , you wan na be on my album ?
I 'm gon na need writing credit for that song AND part of your publishing even though I did n't write anything !
And then I 'm gon na go on tour and gross $ 150 million in ticket sales and not give you any of that , even though I 'm performing your song ! '
I could rattle off a laundry list of artists who I 've had that conversation with !
And I 'm on the other end like ` Oh okay ... so you wan na rape me , but just with the tip ?! ' Britney 's one of the few artists I 've worked with who did n't try to take something that was n't hers .
In my experience , from a business standpoint , her entire team is nothing less than a bonafide class act ! ''
