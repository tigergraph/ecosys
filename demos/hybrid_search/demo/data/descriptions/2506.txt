Mike Nesmith wrote this song inspired by a large collection of old 45 records from the '20s and '30s he purchased at a yard sale .
Along with `` Magnolia Simms , '' this was a tribute to the ragtime and jazz of the '20s , even going so far as recording using gramophone technology to mimic the echo and the skipping of an old recording .
It was also the basis for Nesmith 's first major solo project in 1968 , The Wichita Train Whistle Sings .
