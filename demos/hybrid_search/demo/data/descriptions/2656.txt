This track had to be rush-recorded in a motel room in El Paso , Texas .
`` It was like a 115 ° F -LSB- 46 ° C -RSB- outside so we had to turn the air conditioning off so we could actually record the microphones , and it just got unbelievably hot , '' the band 's Iain Cook told BBC 's Newsbeat .
`` Maybe that was helpful though , to enhance our performance , '' singer Lauren Mayberry added .
Mayberry told Coup De Main magazine this is her favorite track on The Bones of What You Believe .
She explained : `` It was the last , last one we finished to go on the record - we did n't know if it was going to make it or if we were going to save it for something else .
I think it probably represents for me where the band is at best , the sounds and the lyrics and the production feels to me , the most Chvrches song on it .
It 's got a nice bitter sweetness to it , which I think sums up where we 're at . ''
