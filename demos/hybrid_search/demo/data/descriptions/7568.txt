Kim Deal was concerned that this track would bring to mind the American math rock band Battles .
She told Rolling Stone magazine : `` I 'm like , oh my God , everybody thinks we 're going to try to bite off this Battles thing .
But it 's from a lyric . ''
Deal explained to Uncut magazine February 2008 why the album only lasts 36 minutes : `` There 's 13 songs .
It 's about 36 minutes long .
I know that 's kinda short , but I could n't think of another song . ''
