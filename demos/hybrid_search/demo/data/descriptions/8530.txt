This song was written by Qwanell Mosley in response to various familial and financial pressures , which he dealt with very publicly on MTV 's Making The Band 4 .
He penned the tune with Dawn Richard , who was a member of Danity Kane between 2005 and 2009 .
Qwanell explained to hustleGRL.com : `` If you watched the show , you saw the situation I was going through .
You looked at the temper that I was lashing out to everybody but I wrote that song when I was going through that situation ; when I felt like nobody really understood where I was coming from .
So you know artists , they express themselves through music so I just wrote that song and it came out really really good and everybody liked it .
Diddy said it 's his favorite . ''
