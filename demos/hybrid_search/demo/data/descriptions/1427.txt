Guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Troy has described this as Deap Vally 's middle-finger song .
Drummer Julie Edwards told NME : `` We 're not like these savage creatures that somebody found who do n't have any thought process .
We know what we 're doing , we choose what we do . ''
The Sistrionix album was conceived , written and performed by females , and this track was an assault on misogyny and sexism in the music industry .
Drummer Julie Edwards explained to NME : `` It was a track for people who did n't want us to make that kind of music and wanted to control us .
People who saw us as simple natives who did n't have a plan , to whom things happened by accident . ''
