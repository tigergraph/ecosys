Irish poet Paul Durcan , who co-wrote this song , provides the spoken vocals on this track .
In 1988 Durcan wrote : `` Myself , if I was Minister for Education , I 'd bring in a new curriculum in the morning and top of my list would be Kavanagh and Morrison .
All of Kavanagh and Morrison - not my selection or Saint Augustine 's selection or Barry McGuigan 's selection or Dean Martin 's selection but the entire oeuvre and let the audience -LRB- students are a free audience - not a concentration camp of suitable victims -RRB- pick out what they like and what they do n't like . ''
-LRB- from `` A Celebration of Van Morrison , '' May 1988 issue of Magill -RRB- This song lists singers who influenced the youthful Van Morrison including Muddy Waters , John Lee Hooker , Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard .
He also refers to Radio Luxembourg to which thousands of British and Irish teenagers in the 1950s , '60s , and '70s would tune in to on their primitive radios , despite the poor reception , because it played the pop music they wanted to hear .
Patrick Kavanagh -LRB- 1904-1967 -RRB- was an Irish poet who in a 2000 poll by The Irish Times was rated the nation 's second favorite poet behind W. B. Yeats .
Ray Charles evidently is a hero of Van Morrison .
in this song he refers to Ray Charles as `` The high priest . ''
Van Morrison has referred to Ray Charles in other compositions of his .
In `` These Dreams of You '' from Moondance -LRB- 1970 -RRB- , the lyric goes , `` And Ray Charles was shot down . ''
Also in `` Got to Go Back '' from No Guru , No Method , No Teacher -LRB- 1986 -RRB- , some of the words are `` I used to gaze out my classroom window and dream , and then go home and listen to Ray sing . ''
