Kaiser Chief bassist Simon Rix explained to Drowned in Sound : `` This was a deliberate attempt to get more dance floor .
It was the second song we wrote for the album , written in the same few days as ' Never Miss a Beat . '
It has two parts that are separate but they were always part of the song .
The first part is like a more traditional song , Verse - Chorus - Middle 8 affair , although still different with lots of great keyboard sounds , The Who drum fills and some cool backing vocals in the chorus which are one of the main hooks .
The second part is more electronic and builds up and builds up like the euphoric crescendos you get in dance records . ''
Rix told Drowned in Sound that the song is , `` loosely about going out and doing something rather than just sitting in and watching TV . ''
