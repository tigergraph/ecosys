Brice penned this cut with his songwriting buddy Kyle Jacobs .
Here 's what he had to say about the story of the song : `` Sometimes when you 're riding down the road , you just want to hear something nice and easy .
Kyle Jacobs is one of my best friends .
We wrote ` More Than a Memory ' together , and he 's married to Kellie Pickler .
One day we were out having a beer , and he was about to call Kellie .
He said , ` I 've got to go see about a girl . '
I thought , ` We 've got to write that some day . '
It ended up being one of my favorite songs on the album .
It does n't make any huge point , and it 's not going to change the world .
But who knows ?
It might change somebody 's world . ''
