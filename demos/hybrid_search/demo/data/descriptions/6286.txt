This song is about a relationship with someone who keeps coming in and out of your life , and every time they come back they screw up your whole world .
Guitarist Dan Donegan told Artist Direct : `` As far as the message and the meaning goes , a lot of David 's stuff lyrically is relationship-related .
That 's another one of those situations .
I think it 's more so about a person who 's coming in and out of your life in a relationship , and it brings you ` Hell . '
-LSB- Laughs -RSB- . ''
In 2011 it was re-released as the first single from Disturbed 's first-ever B-sides compilation album , The Lost Children .
The song was recorded in early 2005 at Groovemaster Studios in Chicago and originally appeared as a B-side from the band 's single `` Stricken . ''
The song was a bonus track on the UK and Tour edition of Ten Thousand Fists but was left off the American release .
Donegan explained why to Artist Direct : `` At the time , we thought , ` Hell ' is such a cool song , but we want to leave it off hoping we can find the right outlet for it at the right time -- whether it be a soundtrack or a sporting event .
We left it off because we felt it was such a strong song .
The song was always in the back of our minds . ''
