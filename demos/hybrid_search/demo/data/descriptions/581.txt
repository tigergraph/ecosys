Clarkson -LRB- from her record label 's website -RRB- : `` The song is about this guy I was dating , who was so cool , but was n't able to put up with me being in the public eye all the time .
I want a real man , not someone who 's going to walk around on eggshells and be a ` yes ' person .
I want someone to let me know if they 're happy , mad or sad . ''
