For Whatever 's On Your Mind , the seventh album of Gomez 's career , the British alternative rockers took an individual approach to recording the ten tracks .
Firstly the demos were stored in a digital locker then each band member worked on the songs individually before being merged online .
This was partly due to the five of them being scattered across two continents , from Los Angeles to Brooklyn to Brighton , England.Another reason for this method is that the Gomez colleagues have concluded that they work better on their own .
`` It 's just easier to dump everything into a big bucket in the sky , '' singer Ian Ball told Spin Magazine , referring to cloud-based computing .
`` We all have different musical interests , and working solo just takes taste out of the equation .
`` On this track , for example , drummer Olly Peacock wrote the initial version with a verse and `` a bridgy chorus thing , '' before Ball added the track 's central hook and melody .
`` There was no , ` But I really liked that verse ! ' ''
Ball told Spin Magazine .
`` No whining , no moaning .
No one cared if things got changed . ''
