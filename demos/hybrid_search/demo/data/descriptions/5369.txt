Photoshop is computer software that can alter images to make people look a lot better , which is standard procedure for press materials .
On the face of it , this jaunty oddball tune is a withering critique of celebrity magazine airbrush culture .
However , Everything Everything singer Jonathan Higgs told the NME there was more to the tune than meets the eye .
`` It 's imagining what it would be like if you really were like that - you really were one of those creatures and how much of a person you could be , '' he explained .
`` And then thinking about computer games and the value of life in computer games , and how you can constantly reappear as this thing that only has one purpose within a very small world that just has no other options apart from to live , or die , or jump over this thing .
And if that 's the same as being a magazine creature , you just have this one option to be that weird fake thing .
Over and over and over again until that person just is ... Well , that is what they are .
What that must be like to be that person and wake up with that weird silicon face . ''
