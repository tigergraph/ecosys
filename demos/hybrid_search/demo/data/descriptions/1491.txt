Lead singer Anthony Kiedis -LRB- from Rolling Stone , June 15 , 2006 -RRB- : `` It 's about communicating with God by dancing .
Start your dancing engine , and you will have the attention of the great spirit in the sky .
That spirit will instantly pay you mind and listen . ''
Guitarist John Frusciante composed the solo at the end of the song by filling up an entire 24-track recorder with different guitar parts and fading them in and out over the course of the solo .
-LRB- thanks , Michael - Carmel , IN -RRB-
