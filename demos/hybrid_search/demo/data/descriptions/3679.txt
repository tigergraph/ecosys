This Ryan Tedder song was written by the OneRepublic frontman with AJ McLean for the latter 's group , The Backstreet Boys .
After it failed to make the Backstreet Boys ' album , record executive and mentor Simon Cowell earmarked it for Leona Lewis but then decided it better suited Westlife .
Mark Feehily of Westlife commented on this song in publicity materials : `` We actually heard this song - it was one of the first songs that got played to us from the record company .
It 's written by Ryan Tedder , he 's from OneRepublic , he 's done like ` Bleeding Love ' for Leona Lewis , ` Halo ' for Beyonc√© - amongst a lot of other songs - ` Apologize ' , and he wrote it with AJ from the Backstreet Boys but we kind of went and took it , made it our own . ''
He added : `` I think this is one of the songs on the album you could be listening and go ` Wow is that Westlife , really ? '
you know , it 's kind of quite American sound and I suppose vocally we sort of show a bit of versatility in it .
You know , we kinda show a style or a sight of our voices that we have n't shown that much before .
The production is a production you would n't have heard of us , you know , kind of effects on our voices , something we 've wanted for a long time really .
I think that we 're very happy that this song is on the album , it 's one of the songs that on first listen a lot of people like . ''
