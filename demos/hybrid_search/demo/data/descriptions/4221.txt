Shakira is from Columbia , and Spanish is her native language .
The Spanish version of this is called `` Suerte , '' which means `` Luck . ''
Shakira was a star in Latin America , but this was her first hit in English-speaking countries .
The video for this , which was directed by Francis Lawrence , became a huge hit on MTV and introduced her to a new set of fans .
The song is about being willing to travel the world in order to be with a distant lover .
Most of the songs Shakira writes are about love .
One of the key instruments are Andean pan flutes .
They are common in Arabic music , which is a big influence on Shakira .
This was Shakira 's first album recorded in English .
Gloria Estefan wrote this with Shakira .
Estefan has had tremendous success recording in both English and Spanish , but like Shakira , her core fan base is Spanish-speaking .
This was written in Spanish , and the Spanish lyrics are more meaningful .
The English translation is a little goofy , with lines like `` Lucky my breasts are small and humble so you do n't confuse them with mountains . ''
The lack of lyrical depth did not hurt , as the beat , the chorus , and the video made this a hit .
After this was released , Shakira 's boyfriend was the subject of a great deal of controversy .
She was dating Antonio De La Rua , the son of Argentinean president Fernando De La Rua , who resigned in December , 2001 with Argentina 's economy in turmoil .
On his last day in office , 5 protesters were shot by police guarding the presidential palace , which enraged Argentines as well as many other Latin Americans .
Considering Shakira guilty by association , Tower Records refused to sell her CD at the request of the president of Tower Records Argentina .
The younger De La Rua wrote speeches for his father .
He was in the video for another song on the album called `` Underneath Your Clothes . ''
