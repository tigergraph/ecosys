The only David Nail solo composition on The Sound of a Million Dreams , the Country Music singer wrote the song about his wife Catherine Werne , whom he married on June 6 , 2009 in Franklin , Tennessee .
He told the story of the song to Roughstock : `` When we were planning our wedding , we wanted to write our own vows .
When Catherine went to bed one night , I wrote hers , just the first things that came to mind .
They did n't end up being exactly our vows , but they were the basis for them .
This was n't supposed to be a song , but it became one .
It 's a very honest , personal lyric .
As a sidenote , I wrote out the lyrics by hand and framed them for my groomsmen .
It 's symbolic of our wedding day and has become one of my favorite songs , obviously for personal reasons , but also because it came so organically , in lyrics and in music .
It starts as a ballad , but then becomes just a wall of sound .
It almost transforms into a jam-band song by the end . ''
The song features Nashville singer-songwriter Will Hoge , who has opened for such acts as Needtobreathe , Sugarland , Shinedown and Michelle Branch .
