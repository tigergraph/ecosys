`` Living Wreck '' is a group composition written by Purple Mark II -LRB- Blackmore-Gillan-Glover-Lord-Paice -RRB- .
Running to 4 minutes 27 seconds , it is the 6th track on the classic In Rock album ; it was also released as the B Side of `` Black Night '' .
It is probably best not to inquire what - or who - inspired the song , and almost certainly defamatory to answer , but the Scorpions said more or less the same thing -LRB- with added humour -RRB- in 1980 with `` Do n't Make No Promises -LRB- Your Body Ca n't Keep -RRB- '' .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 2 -RRB-
