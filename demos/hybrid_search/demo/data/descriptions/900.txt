Pip Brown , aka Ladyhawke , has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome , a condition which does not help the New Zealand singer when performing her music .
She addresses her stage fright on this autobiographical song , which begins : `` I take a pill to help me through the day .
I stay inside until I feel okay . ''
Brown admitted to The Independent : `` I remember writing that line thinking , ` people are going to ask me about this for sure ' .
And I thought , ' I have to do it ' -- it was like therapy .
I was completely dependent on taking an anti-anxiety pill to even be able to walk out of the house or sit in the car .
I just could n't do it .
I 'd feel sick and freak out and I 'd just hate it .
I ca n't go on the Tube , not even now .
I 'll always think of what could happen .
`` But I 'm much better now , '' she added .
`` A lot of people say , ` why do you do this if you 're so anxious and it 's so hard for you ? '
Because I love it so much , making the music .
The other stuff that comes with it is a small hurdle in the grand scheme of things .
If I was a different person I would n't be Ladyhawke . ''
