Frontman Patrick Stump explained to MTV News that , `` everything we 're trying to say about pop culture , it 's in this song . ''
He added : `` The chorus - ` Change will come , but I will never believe in anything again ' - that 's about the '90s , when we really cared , -LSB- but -RSB- then we got into all this awful mess .
And I think people stopped believing in the goodwill of man and that you can change the world or do any good .
So everything became internalized .
The past decade has been totally about ` me . '
It 's totally about ` Oh , I 'm sad .
I want this .
I know somebody who knows this person .
Me me me me me , ' so that 's what that song is about . ''
The song 's title is a reference to the David Mamet play and film Glengarry Glen Ross where the word `` closer '' is used in the sense of a salesman who can close a sale .
In the movie , Alec Baldwin admonishes Jack Lemmon for not closing real estate deals .
He barks : `` Put .
That coffee .
Down .
Coffee 's for closers only . ''
This was originally titled `` Never Believe . ''
