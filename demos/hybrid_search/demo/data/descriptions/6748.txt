The song is titled after the date of the Chinese Tiananmen Square massacre , in which more than 1,000 unarmed protesters were killed by government troops in a slaughter that crushed China 's emerging pro-democracy movement .
While it centers on the event , the song tells more of a personal story .
Carpenter explained to Express Night Out : `` It was -LSB- inspired by -RSB- an article in the New York Times during the 20th anniversary week of the Tiananmen Square massacre .
It was a profile of an artist in China who was 17 at the time , and he was a soldier in the army .
The first verse is his recollections of what it was like to be there - and to be sent in ` imposter 's clothes , ' when the authorities were trying to infiltrate the protesters .
He was haunted by his part in it .
He 's an artist now in China and he works all the time trying in a way to almost provoke the authorities .
They have this game that they play where they allow him to put his work on the Internet for example , and it 'll stay up for a day or two , and then all of a sudden it 's taken down .
The lyric about ` vanishing into the ether ' is my sense of it .
His story was exceedingly moving to me and I just tried to write about it . ''
