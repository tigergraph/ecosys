Eminem sampled this on his 2000 song `` Stan . ''
Dido appears in the video as Stan 's wife , and sang this with Eminem on some of his tour dates .
This became a hit in the US after it was sampled by Eminem .
The album , which is her first , had been out for a year and a half by then .
It was released as a single after it gained popularity from `` Stan . ''
It was Dido 's 3rd single , after `` Here With Me '' and `` No Angel . ''
Eminem did not ask permission to use this on `` Stan '' until after the song was produced .
Dido loved it agreed to let him use it .
She recalled to Billboard magazine in a 2013 interview : `` I just got a letter saying , ` We heard your track .
We love it .
We 'd like to use it for this track `` Stan . ''
Can you take a listen ?
I hope you like it and can we use your song ? '
It was completely out of the blue .
I put it on like , ' I wonder what he could have done . '
You just do n't know .
And I was a big Eminem fan , so it was pretty cool .
And then I heard it .
I remember because I had some friends staying in the same hotel .
They were literally running down the hall , like ` You got ta listen to this ; it 's just brilliant ! ' ''
