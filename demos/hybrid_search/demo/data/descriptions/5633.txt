The Cover Drive quartet joined up with Steve Mac to pen this song .
The prolific British hitmaker has credits on numerous singles for Westlife , JLS , The Wanted and One Direction as well as Cover Drive 's third top 10 hit `` Sparks . ''
The single version was remixed featuring additional vocals from N-Dubz rapper Dappy .
Lead singer Amanda Reifer explained the song 's meaning to The Sun : `` Explode is that feeling when you are really into someone and you are trying to contain it .
When you are trying to hide the feelings , eventually you burst at the seams . ''
Reifer told Digital Spy about Dappy 's contribution .
`` We sent him the song because the song is originally a song off our album , Bajan Style , and we thought he 'd sound great on it , so we were n't in the studio when he did it .
He just sent it back to us and we loved what he did with it so we decided to make it a single . ''
