Based on a poem vocalist Guy Garvey wrote about his first love and written and recorded on the Isle Of Mull , this minimalist track set the agenda both thematically and musically for Build a Rocket Boys ! .
The song features just Garvey 's voice , a Rhodes keyboard and whispers of other players .
Garvey explained on Elbow 's website : '' ` Jesus Is A Rochdale Girl ' could n't be simpler musically and lyrically .
It 's a list of the details I remember from my life when I was 22 written with the knowledge of how things would unfold .
` Nothing to be proud of and nothing to regret , all of that to make as yet .
` The music sounded to me like the muted heartbeat of someone restraining themselves , thesplashes of clumsy colour from the keyboards being general excitement bubbling up over the sides.At 22 I had been in the band for five years and we knew what we wanted to do .
Life was general excitement , it was easy to remember .
` Jesus Is A Rochdale Girl ' became the blueprint for the record . ''
Garvey was brought up a Catholic but had lost his faith by time he 'd reached his 20s .
He explained to Spin magazine why his former girlfriend Cath , whom he sings of in this song , became his ` saviour . '
Recalled the Elbow singer : `` I lived in this s -- ty house with no heater .
She was an angel that would come across and play records with me .
We were in love .
I 'd lost my faith in God around that time as well and needed a new Jesus .
She took that role . ''
Garvey recalled to Q magazine regarding the former flame he sings about in this song : `` My girlfriend and my music collection were my saviours , cos I did n't have a pot to piss in .
My first heartbreak was that girl .
And being that age and having your own gaff - all the parties were at your place .
That 's where I met a lot of my friends . ''
