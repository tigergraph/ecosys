This is the title track of dance-pop act Selena Gomez & The Scene 's third album .
Selena explained to Billboard magazine the record was named after it , `` because it goes perfectly with describing the whole album and the album artwork . ''
The song was produced by Stefan Abingdon of UK comedy group The Midnight Beast .
They are most famous for their YouTube cover-parody of Ke $ ha 's `` TiK ToK , `` which reached # 4 on the Australian singles chart .
This was the first song that Abingdon produced for another act .
Joey Clement , who is the bassist of The Scene as well as a member of the American band Midwest Kings , gave the song to Selena .
Said the Wizards of Waverly Place star to Billboard magazine : `` It 's really special to my bass player , Joey , who wrote it .
And I got to rewrite the bridge of it as well .
It felt like we got to do that as a band . ''
