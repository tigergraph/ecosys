Singer-guitarist Jerry Cantrell came up with the song 's riff whilst recovering from surgery to repair his damaged shoulder cartridge .
He told Ultimate-Guitar .
com : `` My arm was f -- ked up and I could n't play guitar so I just hummed that riff into a phone and that 's how that song came to be .
When I could play a little bit and we were going through riffs , I remember doing some riffs with Paul Figueroa , our engineer .
I 'm like , ` Wait a minute , I got a good one , man .
Check this out . '
I started f -- kin ' playing it to him and it was me singing into the f -- kin ' phone .
I 'm like , ` Dude , this riff is killer .
Give me a guitar and I 'll f -- kin ' work it out . '
So that song I actually came up with just off a voice message on a phone .
I did n't even have a guitar ; I just f -- kin ' hummed it into the phone . ''
The brooding song includes the lyric : `` What makes you want to carve your initials in me ?
... Find me distant , outwardly rough obscene . ''
Singer William DuVall explained to The Los Angeles Times : `` It seems to be about confronting outside misperceptions .
You think you know me ?
You do n't . ''
