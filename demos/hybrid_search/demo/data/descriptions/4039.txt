Ben Burnley said that this song was the most challenging song ever , especially as a vocalist .
With every verse he goes up a key and it pushed the limits of his singing abilities .
Burnley : `` It 's very cool-both structurally and melodically .
It 's subtle , but listen closely and you 'll hear the song move up a half-step every verse and chorus .
As a vocalist , that 's really challenging because it forces me to sing in a different key every time .
It 's definitely unusual , and had it not been for Billy , I probably never would 've tried something like that . ''
-LRB- thanks , Sarah - Quito , South America , for all above -RRB- Billy Corgan from Smashing Pumpkins encouraged the band to create a new album , not just the same as the first one all over again .
