This is the first single from Anita Baker 's seventh studio album , Only Forever , her first set for seven years .
The Harvey Mason , Jr. produced song is a recreation of American R&B singer Tyrese 's 1999 hit of the same title and Baker lured the crooner to appear on one of two versions of the track .
`` He was like , ' I was 12 years old when I sang that , and I ca n't even get to that key anymore , ' '' Baker recalled to Billboard magazine .
`` And I 'm like , ` We 'll change the key ! '
This is something I did out of love and wanting Tyrese to sing because he 's in the movies and he 's just kind of abandoned his singing . ''
This was one of the first songs Baker cut , analog , in Nashville .
She told The Boombox : `` I brought in a live rhythm section .
I brought it to L.A. , and I called -LSB- Tyrese -RSB- into the studio and I played it for him ; he had no idea .
And he lost it , of course .
He was like , ' I know who has got to produce this ! '
I 'm like , ' I already know , I got Harvey Mason , Jr. , on tap . ' ''
Only Forever finds Baker merging classic sounds with technological advancements .
`` I just had this concept of walking into a digital universe with an analog heart , Baker told The Boombox .
`` So we 're kind of marrying the two .
I started cutting analog down in Nashville , and once I knew what we were gon na do , we bounced it over to the digital format so that the 21st century producers like Harvey Mason , Jr. , could manipulate it.I was just very focused on getting some analog energy in there somewhere , '' she added .
So it 's a lovely bridge that I 'm trying to build tech-wise as well as musically . ''
Anita Baker made history on August 6 , 2012 when she became the first recording artist ever to have a premiere on Urban Adult Contemporary Radio for all Clear Channel stations as they played `` Lately '' every hour on the hour .
