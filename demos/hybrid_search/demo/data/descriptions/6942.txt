Underwood sings of the regrets of a lost relationship on this bittersweet ballad .
The singer penned the song with Dave Berg , who in 2007 received the ASCAP Country Song of the Year award for Rodney Atkins ' `` If You 're Going Through Hell -LRB- Before the Devil Even Knows -RRB- .
The third co-writer , Tom Shapiro , has been a prominent songwriter on the Nashville scene since the 1970s .
Amongst his over 20 chart-toppers is `` Ai n't Nothing ` Bout You '' by Brooks & Dunn , which was named by Billboard magazine as the number one country song of 2001 .
This song of lost love and regret was originally penned for Carrie 's previous album Play On , but did n't make the final track listing .
Carrie 's lyrics utilise a wine-after-whiskey metaphor to describe how later relationships never match up after experiencing true love .
`` Once you 've tasted a love that strong , you ca n't go back and you ca n't settle on anything less , '' she laments .
