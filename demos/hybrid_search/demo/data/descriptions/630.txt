Jamie Cullum explained the background to this song : `` A couple of years ago , I started working on a dance thing with my brother .
We wrote six loosely written songs to play over house beats with him on bass and me playing keys and singing over them .
This is something we wrote for that project which I worked on to make it fit with my sound .
It 's played on and upright piano and a stand-up bass .
It 's a four-to-the-floor House track , almost an acoustic Ibiza type song . ''
