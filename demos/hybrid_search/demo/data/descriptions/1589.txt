This song finds Lorde singing about the changes in her life following her success .
Despite the track 's title , the New Zealander does n't actually play tennis .
`` I 've always been really fascinated by the visual concept of the tennis court , '' she told MTV News .
`` Then also there 's a tennis court in my hometown where me and my friends would hang out when we were kids , right up until we were teenagers , and that was just a symbol that felt kind of nostalgic to me . ''
This song , along with the other Pure Heroine tracks was produced by Joel Little , who is the former frontman of the Pop-Punk group Goodnight Nurse .
Little recalled to Billboard magazine how this song found Lorde 's songwriting maturing .
`` Up until that point , she would bring lyrics and we would take inspiration from there as to where to go with the music , '' he explained .
`` But this was one where I started putting the music together and we came up with melodies over the top , and she wrote to the melody .
As she was developing in songwriting , that became more of an option . ''
`` That song was one where we had everything except the chorus , '' Little continued .
`` She was sitting in the back of the room while I was working on the music and she was saying , ' I think I 've got a chorus idea . '
I asked , ` Can I hear it ? '
and she said , ` No , no , no . '
She would n't sing it to me and then once she had it , she basically sang the entire chorus as you hear it now .
I was like , ` Holy s -- t , this is seriously good . '
This was the first time she had this fully-formed , amazing idea for a chorus .
This is , I do n't know how long into the process , but it was when I was like , ` This girl is going to be an amazing songwriter , or has turned into one in a really short amount of time . '
Then I just added the ` yeahs ' and we tweaked a couple things here and there . ''
The song debuted at # 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 singles chart .
It joined `` Royals , '' `` The Love Club '' and `` Swingin ' Party '' in the Top 20 , making Lorde the first New Zealand artist to have four songs in the Top 20 of her country 's singles chart at one time .
