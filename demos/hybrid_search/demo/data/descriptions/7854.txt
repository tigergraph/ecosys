Urban wrote this song with Darrell Brown .
He said on the Country Music review site Roughstock : `` We 've written a lot of things before .
I asked Darrell to send me some drum loops .
I write a lot from them . ''
Urban expanded on the album title to CMT News .
He said : `` It 's a very ` up ' record , and the record is a lot of that - falling in love and being brave to fall in love - because it takes a lot of bravery to open your heart up and be vulnerable to love .
And so it 's about rising above things and enduring and not being dragged down .
There are a lot of metaphors for that in the title . ''
The inspiration for this song came from a heart to heart conversation Urban and Brown had during a lunch break .
Brown told People Magazine : `` We were sitting on a picnic bench talking about the song and about life .
It 's like group therapy when I 'm with Keith . ''
Urban added that he shared something his wife once said that stuck with him : `` Early on when we were dating , she said , ` I 'm ready to be brave for us , for you , ' and I thought , ` My God , that 's what it 's about . ' ''
The Defying Gravity album title comes from a line in this song .
Urban explained to Roughstock : `` We were in the studio doing some overdubs on the song and as I was listening to the fiddle that was being played , I heard the lyrics going by and especially that line ` defying gravity . '
I wrote it down and I realized that 's really what this record is about . ''
Defying Gravity was Urban 's first ever # 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart .
