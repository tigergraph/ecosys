Singer Stephen Garrigan and guitarist Mark Prendergast both grew up in Swords , near Dublin airport , and met aged eight when they were the only boys in the school choir .
They were later joined by drummer Vinny May Jr. , who also lived a stone 's throw away , and bassist Jason Boland .
Originally calling themselves 21 Demands , the quartet made chart history in March 2007 , when their debut single `` Give Me A Minute '' topped the Irish Singles Chart ; becoming the first independently released track to achieve the feat .
The band changed its name to Kodaline in 2011 .
The Dublin-based quartet released their debut extended play , The Kodaline EP , in September 2012 .
One of four tracks featured on the disc , `` All I Want , '' was picked up by BBC Radio 1 as well as being featured in the season 9 episode of Grey 's Anatomy .
The song 's music video was directed by Stevie Russell and features Irish actor Liam Cunningham -LRB- Game of Thrones -RRB- as a man attempting to commit suicide .
Garrigan wrote the song at a time when the band did n't have any direction .
`` We were doing our own thing and I was sitting at the piano and going through a tough time and wrote that song about just trying my best to think positive , '' he told Radio.com .
`` As clich√© as it is , music is therapy .
It 's like venting .
You 're getting it off your chest and it feels good . ''
This was released as the lead single from Kodaline 's debut studio album In a Perfect World .
The song was made available as a Digital download on March 15 , 2013 reaching # 1 in the band 's native Ireland .
Garrigan writes most of the music but insists the rest of the band contribute .
`` It 's intensely personal stuff , '' he told The Independent . ''
` High Hopes ' was written just after I dropped out of college and had no direction whatsoever .
Everything was going badly but I tried to stay positive .
It 's all based on experience . ''
