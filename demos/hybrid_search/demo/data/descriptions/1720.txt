The title track from Soul crooner Robin Thicke 's fifth album finds him singing about how fiery arguments between partners frequently end up in passionate make-up sessions .
`` Do n't you love it when we fight ? ''
he croons .
The song was released as the first single from the LP on October 11 , 2011 .
Speaking to US Weekly , Thicke explained sex is a vital part of his marriage to Patton as they are apart so much due to work .
`` My wife is an actress , a mother , and a wife and I am a husband , a father and a singer so we have n't seen each other a lot the past couple of weeks , '' he said .
`` We wo n't see each other a lot until Christmas and it 's very difficult , but the only thing that gets us by is having great sex together .
There is never enough -LSB- sex -RSB- .
When it does happen , it goes on for hours . ''
The sensual Hype Williams directed video finds Thicke making out with his real-life wife Paula Patton whom we see parading around in a blonde wig and lingerie .
The actress is best known for her roles as Claire Kuchever in the science-fiction thriller Déjà Vu and Jane Carter in Mission : Impossible -- Ghost Protocol .
She previously appeared with her husband in his 2006 video for `` Lost Without You . ''
Thicke became a father for the first time when his son , Julian , was born on April 6 , 2010 .
He told The Boombox how his little boy inspired some of his lyrics for the Love After War album .
`` Julian has been nothing but an angel , '' he said .
`` He 's changed my way of songwriting .
On Love After War , there are so many little lines that have a connection with children and the effect you have on the future of a child .
There 's one message : never give up no matter what happens .
That 's a common thread throughout the album .
I 'm speaking to my son .
This is something he will get to listen to when he 's older so he can keep believing in himself . ''
