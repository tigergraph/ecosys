Singer Aluna Francis admitted to The Sun that she was embarrassed to bring the idea for this song to beatmaker George Reid .
`` I was like , ` Ewww , George , I made a really cheesy pop ballad , ' '' she said .
`` Then he took it and experimented with the notes and melody to express the song in an unusual way .
I 'm always really surprised with what he comes up with . ''
