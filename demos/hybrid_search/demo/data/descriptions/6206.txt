This was the first track on Alison Moyet 's first solo album , co-written by Steve Jolley , Tony Swain and the lady herself , it runs to 3 minutes 52 seconds , and was released on the Columbia label backed by `` Baby I Do '' .
In 1979 , the Barclay James Harvest song `` Loving Is Easy '' was banned from the BBC Top Of The Pops programme because of what appeared to be vague sexual innuendos ; in 1984 , `` Love Resurrection '' faced no such problems , even though it includes two thinly veiled references to sexual activity : '' ... a warm injection Is all I need to calm the pain `` And '' ... I want you to grow in my hand '' .
Although `` Love Resurrection '' did well in the UK singles chart , Americans were not so impressed ; it entered the Billboard Chart at # 89 week ending July 5 , 1985 , and peaked at # 82 .
