This eight minute epic with no chorus was chosen by the band as their first single from Primary Colours - they gave it away as a free download .
Bassist/synth player Tom Cowan explained why to Interview Magazine : `` It says everything that needs to be said in the new album .
And it says it without it having to be packaged into a three minute pop single , and without having to concern ourselves with how it would fare in the charts .
We put it out there , and let people draw their own conclusions . ''
This track was produced by Geoff Barrow from the English band Portishead .
