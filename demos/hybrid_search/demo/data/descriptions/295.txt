Stephen Christian wrote this delicate ballad after spending time with his grandfather on his deathbed .
He explained to Artist Direct : `` When I was in Sao Paolo , Brazil last year , my grandfather passed away .
I could n't make it to his funeral .
Right before I left for Brazil , I got a phone call from my dad that my grandfather was losing health and there 's a chance that he 'd pass away while I was in Brazil .
I rerouted my trip right before I went to Brazil to make sure I went through Texas where he lived .
I got to spend a few moments with him while he was alive before I went on my trip .
That song is about those last few seconds I spent with him before he passed away .
The song says , ` Stop taking life for granted . '
It 's a warning for everyone to hold on to the moments you do have , while the ones you love are still here .
It comes from that place . ''
