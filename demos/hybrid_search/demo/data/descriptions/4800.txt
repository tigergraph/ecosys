In this song Christina sings about someone in her musical past who let her down or doubted her .
The line , `` We wrote ` Loving Me 4 Me , do n't Walk Away , Ca n't Hold Us Down , all part of our history , Do n't forget Infatuation , I 'm a Fighter , Feeling Underappreciated '' indicates the song is directed at Scott Storch , who produced her 2002 album Stripped and was the co-writer of the songs she mentioned .
This brings to light a new meaning to the title : F -- k You Scott Storch .
