This poignant ballad is about Pop music singer-songwriter Amy Grant 's mother .
The singer told Christianity Today about her mom : `` Her childhood was not easy .
Her parents divorced when she was two -- and that was not happening in 1933 .
Her dad died when she was a little girl .
And so with us , she always had a kind of vulnerability .
But I always knew she loved me .
She was very gracious and kind .
My mom would say things to me when I was growing up like ` Do n't worry , Amy .
A woman 's most beautiful years are 35 to 45 . '
Which really takes the heat off when you 're looking at pimples in the mirror , or even when you cross the threshold of being 21 : ` Woo-hoo , you can order a beer . '
But for her to have the wisdom to say when you 're really going to feel beautiful , and that will translate to looking beautiful , is when you have life under your belt .
I just love that .
Totally took the heat off .
Do n't worry .
Thirty-five , I 'll be there . ''
The song was a favorite at Grant 's live shows for several years before it became available in physical form for the first time on Somewhere Down the Road .
