This is cover of Eric Donaldson 's 1971 Reggae song .
The Stones recorded Goats Head Soup 3 years earlier in Jamaica , but this is the most they got into Reggae .
The Reggae group from England UB40 also covered this .
It 's on their 1983 album Labour Of Love .
-LRB- thanks , Christopher - Greenfield Center , NY -RRB- This was the first time Ron Wood appeared on a Stones album .
They were auditioning lead guitarists during Black And Blue , and while Wood only played on this and `` Hey Negrita , '' he was named to the band before it was released and appeared on the cover .
Charlie Watts -LRB- from According to the Rolling Stones -RRB- : `` The Reggae influence on the songs on Black And Blue came primarily from Keith ... Mick was certainly into Reggae .
I had all those -LRB- Reggae -RRB- records in France with me when we moved there and when we were recording tracks for Exile On Main Street at Keith 's house .
Mick used to have them as well .
I 'd play him ` Cherry Oh Baby ' or he 'd play one to me .
And The Harder They Come was an album Keith listened to a lot . ''
