A very dark song with a Leon Russell influence , Bernie Taupin made up the story about a lunatic ranting on visiting day at the asylum .
Predictably , it was n't chartworthy , but it did provide the album title as well as plenty of speculation that Elton was singing about United States president Richard Nixon .
Taupin says that was n't the case , although he was quite amused by the interpretation .
He says the lunatic in the song was n't based on anyone in particular .
`` Tiny Dancer '' and `` Levon '' were the most popular songs on the Madman Across the Water album , but Elton says that he feels most connected to the title track .
The album marked a major musical shift for Elton , as he brought a guitarist into his band for the first time , enlisting Davey Johnstone .
