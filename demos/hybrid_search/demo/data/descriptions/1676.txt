Lloyd explained to The Boombox that this track is , `` about poverty , injustices to minorities and war .
It 's about how we all really hate to see people struggle and unfortunately , be mistreated . ''
Most of the tracks on King of Hearts concern the subject of relationships .
Lloyd told Boombox why he closed the album with a song about social injustice .
Said the singer : `` There are many sides to the man who is Lloyd , who is the ` King Of Hearts . '
The king has many responsibilities to love and to protect , and to be honest in baring his soul .
He has to be someone who is the example of a man . ''
The song features R. Kelly , Keri Hilson and K'naan with each vocalist offering their view on how to improve the world .
