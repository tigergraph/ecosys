This Tony Martin , Neil Thrasher and Wendell Mobley penned ballad features the lyric , `` She gets under your skin like a tattoo . ''
`` When you have a killer melody and a killer lyric to go along with it , that just makes all the difference , '' Aldean told Billboard magazine . ''
` She gets under your skin like a tattoo , ' what a great line , the first time I heard it I was hooked . ''
Despite his enthusiasm for the tune , Aldean originally did n't record it for Night Train .
`` We did n't cut it the first time -LSB- in the studio -RSB- , and I was kicking myself , because I thought it was better than some of the things we had cut , '' he admitted to Billboard .
`` So when we decided to go back in and cut four songs , I went in to the label and Michael -LSB- Knox , producer -RSB- , and said , ` alright , I talked myself out of cutting this the first time around , and I 'm kicking myself for it , so we 're cutting it . '
And it turned out to be a monster , so at this point it 's probably my favorite song on the album . ''
