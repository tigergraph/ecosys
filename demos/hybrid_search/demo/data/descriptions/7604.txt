The title of this song , along with another track on the CD -LRB- `` But It 's Better When We Do '' -RRB- comes from a line by Natalie Portman in the 2004 movie Closer .
-LRB- thanks , Rachel - South Point , OH -RRB- This , along with other songs on the album , was inspired by guitarist Ryan Ross ' anger towards his girlfriend from home who had cheated on him , thereby ending their three-year relationship .
He told the Guardian newspaper June 20 , 2008 : `` At the time it felt like the world had ended .
I hated everything .
It affected that whole album .
I guess it 's good that I wrote it down .
I might have stabbed somebody . ''
The song seems to deal with cheating , as evidenced by the video , where everyone has fish tanks surrounding their heads .
We see a girl walking down the street who notices a stray fish -LRB- representing a boy -RRB- .
She picks it up and puts it in her tank -LRB- representing sleeping with a boy -RRB- .
Her boyfriend finds out and dies .
She discovers him , and does the same .
The ambulance team , played by the band , puts them in the water , where they are reincarnated , never to surface again .
-LRB- thanks , Mettalica - Nunya , Mexico -RRB-
