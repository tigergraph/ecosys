Songwriter Harley Allen was working on this song when Darryl Worley walked into the room .
`` He had this whole hook line , it was ' I love this crazy , tragic , sometimes almost magic awful , beautiful life , ' Worley told us .
`` He was planning this sort of blue-grassy feel .
`` Already thinking Allen had a hit on his hands with the song , when he asked Worley to help him finish it , Darryl 's first thought was , `` What can I add to that ?
`` So at Allen 's behest , the two proceeded to make the song personal , and add Darryl 's story to it .
`` Every name that 's mentioned , Mom and Dad , and the brothers , and cousin Michael in Iraq , it 's all real stuff .
And I guess that was my job in that particular co-writing situation , '' he says .
`` And it was one of the few big hit songs that I 've ever had that I was a writer on .
I told Harley , I said , ` Man , I do n't want you to give me anything . '
And I just really felt like the foundation for the song was there .
It was already done .
The melody and everything , it was a beautiful thing .
But , '' he adds with a laugh , `` I 'm not an idiot either .
So we wrote it that day , and I did what he asked me to do , I brought my personal elements , and everything about that song is honest and real .
But Harley Allen does not need Darryl Worley to write a song , I promise you that . ''

This was the first single from Worley 's fourth studio album , and went to # 1 on the Country charts , a position it held for 2 weeks .
Regarding the lyrics , `` We said a prayer for Cousin Michael in Iraq / We 're all aware that he may never make it back , '' Worley says Cousin Michael did make it back , and he 's doing just fine .
`` He 's got three little girls and a little boy .
He 's a baby-making machine .
He 's a safety coordinator at a large paper mill , so he 's working , and he 's taking care of those babies . ''
