Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones composed most of this on a synthesizer .
They never played the song live because Jones could not reproduce the synthesizer sound outside the studio .
This was based on a song Led Zeppelin had written called `` In The Morning . ''
At one point , it was titled Originally called `` Take Me Home . ''
Near the beginning of the song , Jimmy Page played his guitar with a violin bow .
He also used the bow on `` Dazed And Confused '' and `` How Many More Times . ''
Talking about the song in the BBC book The Guitar Greats , Page said : `` Once the vocal lines and phrasing were sorted out , you 'd know where not to play , which was as important as knowing when you should play .
With ` In The Light , ' for instance , we knew exactly what its construction was going to be , but nevertheless , I had no idea at the time that John Paul Jones was going to come up with such an amazing synthesizer intro , plus there 's all the bowed guitars at the beginning as well , to give the overall drone effect .
We did quite a few things with drones on , like ` In The Evening ' and all that , but when he did that start for ` In The Light ' it was just unbelievable . ''
A bootlegged demo of this song exists with different lyrics and opening .
In that version , John Paul Jones opens with a simple sythesizer and Robert Plant starts with the lines , `` Sunshine brings laughter ... '' -LRB- thanks , Adrian - Gettysburg , PA -RRB-
