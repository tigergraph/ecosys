Parachute 's lead singer and guitarist Will Anderson co-wrote this track with the Country trio Lady Antebellum .
He explained to AOL Music how the collaboration came about : `` I went on a tour with them for a few days just to write .
We were n't looking for any Parachute songs in it at the time .
But we had a chance to write and ended up writing a song for somebody else that -LSB- Parachute -RSB- loved so much that I called -LSB- Lady Antebellum -RSB- and said , ` Do n't give this to anybody . '
And I claimed it for our band .
So when the band came back in December to finish up the record , we realized that song really filled what we needed .
So we decided to record , and I revamped the lyrics to fit our band . ''
