Amongst the celebrities that Green pokes fun at on this track are Cribs frontman Ryan Jarman , and his girlfriend , the singer Kate Nash .
The background to Green 's diss is a Twitter argument that he had with Jarman , who accused the rapper of chatting up Nash at a gig .
Green told The Daily Star this track , `` goes into the whole thing , '' adding .
`` I have a beautiful girlfriend .
Kate Nash is definitely different-looking to the girls I 've been out with so I ask Ryan Jarman how you can accuse me of clucking over Krusty the Clown -LRB- The Simpsons -RRB- ; that 's an insult in itself . ''
