This is the second single from Texan four-piece hard rock band Drowning Pool 's self-titled fourth studio album .
Bassist Stevie Benton spoke to FMQB about the track .
Said Benton : `` It 's really just your typical dude/chick song .
It 's a theme that guys have been writing songs about for years and years .
It 's just about a chick that 's being a bitch , to put it bluntly .
It 's about giving and giving and giving to someone just to have them take and take and take , and then turn their back on you . ''
The song 's music video shows the band standing inside a room made of ice .
Benton told FMQB there were no special effects , the quartet really were surrounded by ice .
He explained : `` It 's a place with a warehouse where they make , store and distribute ice .
I did n't even know this was a business , but apparently it is !
So we 're in the warehouse and it 's like 13 degrees in there , and to top it off , a friend of the director was standing off camera with a chainsaw , digging into blocks of ice and shooting it up in our faces .
Our hair got wet and covered with ice , and that made the 13 degrees feel even colder !
I 'm not a fan of the cold weather at all .
I live in Texas .
I like it 100 degrees ! ''
