This slow blues number refers to the wife literally from hell and it concludes with a demonic cackle from Dylan .
The singer-songwriter legend can also be heard laughing on `` Bob Dylan 's 115th Dream , '' a track on his 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home .
Dylan borrowed the line `` I 'm pretty sure she 'll make me kill someone , '' from Geoffrey Chaucer 's medieval masterpiece Canterbury Tales .
The quote appears in a translation of the prologue to The Monk 's Tale .
Chicago blues has always been a huge influence on Dylan , and on this song he borrows from Willie Dixon 's `` I Just Want to Make Love to You . ''
In an interview published on Dylan 's website , he was asked if he really believed the line in this song : `` Dreams never did work for me anyway . ''
Dylan replied : `` Well , yeah .
Dreams can lead us up a blind alley .
Everybody has dreams .
We go to sleep and we dream .
I 've always thought of them as coming out of the subconscious .
I guess you can interpret them .
Dreams can tell us a lot about ourselves , if we can remember them .
We can see what 's coming around the corner sometimes without actually going to the corner . ''
