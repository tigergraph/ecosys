This is a track from Anarchy , My Dear , the fifth studio album by American indie rock band Say Anything .
According to frontman Max Bemis , the record is the band 's '' first attempt to write a true ` punk ' record . ''
He added : `` Thematically speaking , it 's a collection of songs about subverting society and destroying the boundaries humankind has placed upon ourselves both physically and in our minds .
Coincidentally , it also happens to be the first record we 've made in years where we had total freedom to explore our ` edgier ' side and present a raw picture of what the band is truly about onstage . ''
Speaking with Billboard magazine , Bemis said that he wrote Anarchy , My Dear , `` to reach people that are diehard Say Anything fans . ''
He went on to say that this song is a sequel to the '' ` Admit It !!! '' the closing track from the band 's 2004 album , . .
Is a Real Boy , `` that skewered modern hipster culture in its infancy , '' adding : `` We know how much ` Admit It !!! ' is an important song to people who love Say Anything , and that was my first imperative for writing ` Admit It Again . '
That was an example of me wanting to write a record that would just put a smile on the face of anyone who 's really dedicated themselves to our band . ''
