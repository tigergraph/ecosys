With such lyrics as `` Posh girls have good manners / But they go like the clappers , '' and `` There 's nothing like a little bit of class / Wrapped in a perfect arse , '' this song has been dubbed sexist by critics .
However , frontman Roy Stride refutes the charge .
He told The Daily Mail May 7 , 2010 : `` Some people have said Posh Girls is misogynistic , but I do n't agree .
It stemmed from a conversation I overheard on a bus .
There were two blokes chatting , and one of them said posh girls ` go like the clappers . '
I thought it was a brilliant line for a song .
It 's supposed to be a fun number that people can jump around to at gigs .
But I do n't think that many other bands could get away with it .
I 'm a Coldplay fan , but I ca n't imagine Chris Martin singing it .
We tackle subjects like that with a knowing wink . ''
