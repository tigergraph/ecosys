This is the lead single from American Idol season five finalist Mandisa 's third album , What If We Were Real .
The 11 tracks encourage shining the light on whom we really are , including both the good and the bad ; the theme of the record also coincided with Mandisa 's public struggles with food addiction and weight loss .
`` A struggle is a struggle , and Jesus is there through it all , '' the singer explained .
`` He is there in compassion and grace .
I have found that what He has spoken to me through these songs has been encouraging and I think that 'll be true for other people who are going through their own hard times . ''
Inspired by the belief that surviving hardship makes us more resilient , `` Stronger '' summed up the previous 12 months of Mandisa 's life .
`` That song is very appropriate for me , '' commented the American Idol finalist .
`` When I look back on this year and reflect on the difficult things I 've gone through , I realize I 've grown the most not from when things were great , but from when they were hard .
` Stronger ' is encouragement for anybody who is going through a similar time .
As long as you 're still here and still walking through , you 'll be stronger in the end . ''
