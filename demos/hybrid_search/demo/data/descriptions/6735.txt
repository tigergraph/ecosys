This is the first single from American rapper Juelz Santana 's third studio album , Born to Lose , Built to Win .
Santana revealed to MTV 's RapFix Live in a 2012 interview that the then chairman of Def Jam , LA Reid , suggested that Brown be replaced on the song .
Their collaboration followed Breezy 's assault on the label 's star artist , Rihanna , and the Bajan star 's label wanted to protect her .
`` They asked me to take Chris Brown off and put Trey Songz on the song , '' he revealed .
`` I 'm like , ' I ca n't do that .
Chris is my homey . ' ''
-LSB- Reid -RSB- definitely did that through issues that had to do with Rihanna and Chris Brown and the label situation , '' continued Santana .
`` It was weird because I told him that was the move I was makin ' before I made it . ''
The song features Chris Brown .
Santana previously collaborated with the R&B singer on Brown 's breakthrough single , `` Run It ! ''
and on a re-mix for his 2006 single `` Poppin , '' along with Lil Wayne .
This was the first time Brown appeared on one of Santana 's singles .
