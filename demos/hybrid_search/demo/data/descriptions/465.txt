Reaching # 2 on the US Country chart and # 6 in Canada , this song is one of four Country hits from Hal Ketchum 's album Sure Love .
`` Hearts Are Gon na Roll '' was written by Hal Ketchum and Ronnie Scaife .
From the royalty checks from this single , co-author Ronnie Scaife bought a new transmission for his race car Hellbilly , which he races in Tennessee .
The song was written about having daughters , and those very challenging times for their fathers when boys start coming around .
In our Songfacts interview with Hal Ketchum , while referencing this song 's subject , Ketchum was asked if he was ever tempted to sit with a shotgun on his knee waiting for his daughter 's suitors .
Ketchum 's response was that his favorite line was `` I 've been to prison and I 'm not afraid to go back . ''
It seems to work !
Curb Records , the independent record label which released the Sure Love album , is quite a star player in the Nashville music scene .
Amongst their accomplishments : the purchase and restoration of Elvis Presley 's first home and the Johnny Cash Museum in Memphis , Tennessee , the Curb Event Center in Nashville , which hosted the Town Hall Presidential debate between McCain and Obama , and numerous charitable programs through the Mike Curb Family Foundation .
