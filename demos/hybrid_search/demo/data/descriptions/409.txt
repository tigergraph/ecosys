This is a single by American folk-rock singer-songwriter Kyle Andrews .
The happy-go-lucky song was featured in the `` Stay You '' Holiday Inn commercial , which aired in the summer of 2010 .
The inspiration for this danceable , upbeat tune came during a cold , rainy week in Nashville when Kyle and his roommate Neil challenged themselves to `` write a song that was so happy , it would entice the sun to shine once again . ''
Four hours later , they finished writing and recording the song , and , sure enough , the sun was shining brightly .
