Huey P. Long -LRB- 1893-1935 -RRB- was the charismatic populist Governor of the State of Louisiana .
A champion of the rural poor and avowed enemy of finance capitalism , in particular the Federal Reserve System , he instituted a program called `` Share Our Wealth . ''
`` Every Man A King '' was his campaign song , which Long co-wrote with Professor Castro Carazo , head of the Louisiana State Band .
It was also the title of his autobiography.Long had his critics , he was regarded by some as a demagogue , and has been smeared as both a Communist and a Fascist , but there is no doubting his commitment to the welfare of the people of Louisiana .
The legacy of his 4 year term ran to building or rebuilding most of the state 's infrastructure , including a staggering 111 bridges , and a new charity hospital in New Orleans .
Like so many political giants , Long was assassinated by a small-minded individual who could never have aspired to be half the man he was .
Although he was born in Los Angeles , Randy Newman grew up in Louisiana , a move that is described in his autobiographical song `` Dixie Flyer , '' and is obviously an admirer of Long .
Newman created his own arrangement of the song and brought it to a contemporary audience .
