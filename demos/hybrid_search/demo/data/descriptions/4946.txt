This is London born R&B singer Estelle 's lead single from her third album All of Me .
The song was premiered on February 26 , 2010 via the singer 's official website.Later it was announced that the song would no longer be the first single from the album , after it only reached # 103 on the UK Chart .
It was replaced with the official first single `` Fall In Love , '' and `` Freak '' was instead named as only a buzz single .
The song samples Soul II Soul 's 1989 hit , `` Back To Life '' -LRB- However Do You Want Me -RRB- . ''
The song was ultimately left off the final track listing of All Of Me because of its poor commercial performance .
However it did feature on both the soundtrack of the Step Up 3D movie and the deluxe edition of David Guetta 's One More Love album .
The techno-happy track features Canadian rapper Kardinal Offishall and was produced by David Guetta .
Estelle previously collaborated with the French DJ on his single , `` One Love . ''
The song 's lyrics address people releasing their individuality , and its Nabil Elderkin-directed music video reflects this by featuring Estelle in a whole host of looks , including black body paint .
The singer described the many looks featured in the clip as a `` kind of a metaphor of how you control your life , so you know you have your different personalities and you know you bring them out when you need to . ''
