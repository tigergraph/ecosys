Never Shout Never -LRB- aka Christofer Ingl -RRB- told Artist Direct the story behind this song : `` I was actually sitting in a Santa Monica restaurant , eating with one of my buddies .
There was this beautiful waitress , and I did n't know her name but she served me an awesome veggie burger .
I was like , ` I 'm going to write her a song , I 'm going to go back and play it for her and I 'm going to win her heart . '
I went back to my beach house and then started writing this crazy song about a girl named ` Jane Doe ' because I did n't know the waitress 's name yet .
I never ended up playing it for her though .
It was really sad that I chickened out -LSB- Laughs -RSB- . ''
