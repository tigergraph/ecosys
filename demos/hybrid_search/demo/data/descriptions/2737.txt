The first single from North East England folk group The Unthanks ' fourth album , Last is a bit of the wild card as it 's a cover of a 12 minute jazz-rock odyssey from King Crimson 's 1974 LP Red .
Stripped down to a piano ballad , the Unthanks ' version features vocals by Becky Unthank .
The band 's co-vocalist Rachel Unthank , who is married to McAlly , told Spinner : `` It 's not music that me and Becky were grown up with .
It was Adrian 's idea .
He got into his parent 's record collection , wide and varied and included a lot of prog-rock .
King Crimson 's ` Starless ' was such a beautiful song , and because the melody is so beautiful .
When he played it to me and Becky , we fell in love with the melody .
Becky loved the words and wanted to sing them .
Adrian turned it into a string quartet song .
It 's something we 've enjoyed singing onstage .
-LRB- King Crimson vocalist -RRB- John Wetton came to see us as well .
He was very nice about it , very generous , though his singing is slightly different from Becky , '' she added with another laugh .
The Unthanks ' manager , pianist and producer Adrian McAlly , told Mojo magazine why the band decided to reach to Robert Fripp 's prog rock group for material : `` Chris -LRB- Price , Unthanks guitarist and I grew up with a fairly comprehensive prog rock education and we 're all to aware of its pitfalls and pomposity .
Some bands did n't care about the lyrics , or even having a decent singer , as long as they could play in 9/8 time , but others , like King Crimson , did care.I wanted to free a fairly well-written song about depression - well , we think it 's about depression - and show it to be something beautiful when not inhibited by prog 's trappings .
