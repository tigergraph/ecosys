This is a duet between Merriweather and the British singer Adele .
Merriweather told ilikemusic.com about his collaboration with the Chasing Pavements artist : `` She is such a sweet-heart and she has one of the most beautiful voices I 've ever heard .
I 've known her for a couple of years and I had this song and just thought how amazing it would be if she could sing it with me .
She is just lovely to work with .
So that was amazing . ''
Merriweather told We7 that lyrically , `` it 's about the seven days that happen after you break up with someone . ''
Celine Dion recorded this as the title track of her 2013 studio album .
Merriweather expressed his irritation after learning that Dion praised Adele for the song but not him .
The Canadian singer had not realized the Australian singer had written and recorded the tune , mistakenly believing it was originally an Adele cut .
Merriweather co-wrote this with British songwriter Eg White , who also co-wrote `` Chasing Pavements '' with Adele .
The Daily Mirror November 6 , 2009 asked Merriweather between him and Adele , who is the water and who is the flame ?
`` I 've been out with Adele and she 's very quick-witted , '' he replied , `` I would n't like to be on the receiving end of any of her insults - so I guess she would be the flame . ''
