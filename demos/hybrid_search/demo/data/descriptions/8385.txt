This is the lead single by pop singer Mika from his third studio album The Origin of Love .
The song features Pharrell Williams and was written by the pair along with the little known FrYars , whom Mika found online .
It was produced by Nick Littlemore from Empire Of The Sun .
Speaking about the recording of the song , Mika explained : `` This kind of collaboration is only possible when everyone throws themselves into it wanting to have fun and without any ego .
`` He added : `` This collective and open attitude was at the heart of The Origin of Love .
It 's an album about crazy love songs and tolerance .
It was recorded in Miami and London but mostly in frYars ' north London bedroom studio . ''
Mika explained how he came to collaborate with Pharrell Williams on this song during an interview with Blunt Talking . ''
I think Pharrell had heard what I was doing and was quite intrigued , '' he said . ''
He contacted me through a mutual friend and we met up and wrote this sad song called ` China Boy . ' ''
Then I took it to Nick Littlemore from Empire , we reworked it and turned it into ` Celebrate . '
It was just happy chaos theory . ''
Lyrically , the song finds Mika celebrating life following a difficult patch .
He told Digital Spy : `` This single was me realising that I was happy again .
I was that feeling that , f -- ing hell , I can make this strange music that no-one else is allowed to make !
I can still envisage Nick -LSB- Littlemore -RSB- in the corner high as a kite and Ben Garrett who I found on the internet making beats in the corner .
It was crazy . ''
Mika explained on the album 's track by track video breakdown that this started off with him and Pharrell Williams working in Miami on a song that was called `` China Boy '' .
He added that the chorus ` When I wake up , I feel better , and I pull myself together , I remember those two letters , It will be OK ' was `` very Pharrell , '' alluding to the `` be OK '' at the end.Mika referred to the song 's breakdown as having `` this silly moment , '' when he sings about , `` no matter how miserable I am , it does n't matter cause , I get the whole world to celebrate , and , that was the heart of almost everything .
`` He concluded that , `` it 's not supposed to hit over your head , '' adding that it `` can sit nicely next to ` Origin Of Love ' and next to ` Lola , ' even knowing it clearly has a more , you know , dancing intention . ''
The song finds Mika developing his sound with the help of his collaborators .
He told The Daily Mail : `` Celebrate is the kind of song that is only possible when everyone throws themselves into a session without any ego .
And that open attitude is at the heart of the album .
You might recognise my fingerprints but it 's an evolution .
You ca n't stay in the same place . ''
