Pete Yorn and Gary Louris helped The Chicks write this .
Emily Robison says : `` That 's a song touching on where we are in our lives and our relationships , trying to get your partner to be # 1 in your life and putting the focus back on your marriage , as opposed to just being mom and dad .
Kind of a ` where are we now ' look at married life .
`` Martie Maguire added : `` I thought we 'd write more about our families than we did .
We 're really good friends , but we do n't always talk a lot about our personal lives - maybe out of not wanting to burden the others , or even just to keep a bit of privacy . ''
