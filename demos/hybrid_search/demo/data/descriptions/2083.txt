In concerts , Chris Carrabba has said that this song was written during a relationship in which his girlfriend had somewhat of a criminal record .
The beginning line , `` Would it kill you to breathe easy ?
Only seventeen miles lay between you and me , I could make if it I had to '' refer to a time when his girlfriend stole a car and then needed him to come pick her up after the police were after her , seventeen miles across town .
