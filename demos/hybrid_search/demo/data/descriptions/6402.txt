Speaking to Hails and Horns magazine , frontwoman and lyricist Cristina Scabbia explained why she 's especially drawn to this song about heartbreak .
`` I feel really attached to a song called ` Falling ' 'cause it 's a very personal one with a decadent mood .
It 's related to the feelings you can have after a break up or in a bad moment of your life .
It 's an easy song to relate to 'cause I am absolutely sure everyone felt like that at least once in a lifetime . ''
