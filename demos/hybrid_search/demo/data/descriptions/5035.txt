This is one of several songs on Babel that talk about being away from loved ones .
Bassist Ted Dwane told Rolling Stone the Mumfords ' busy touring schedule and all the traveling that involves has had a huge impact in the songs they create .
`` We always just write about what we know and what we feel , '' he said .
`` We 're inspired by all sorts of stuff - books , dreams or whatever .
I think after the couple of years that we 've had - the way it unfolded and being away so much - inevitably that 's a theme that 's going to occur on the record .
It 's something that we 've all shared , so we can write songs about that sort of stuff and all share intensely .
We all can understand what we 're singing about . ''
