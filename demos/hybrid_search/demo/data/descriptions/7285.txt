Danger Mouse , who is best known for being one half of Gnarls Barkley , produced this song along with the rest of the album .
Beck and Danger Mouse knew each other casually before making the record and some of Beck 's former musicians have also played with Gnarls Barkley .
Beck told Rolling Stone magazine that they were both surprised at how naturally they worked together .
`` It felt like we could have been making our fourth record together .
It did help that we share a lot of musical references .
We spent the first week just talking about different records .
His knowledge is pretty deep , especially with some of the obscure late - '60s , early - '70s rock . ''
Beck explained to Renee Montagne on NPR 's Morning Edition how he writes his songs .
Said Beck : `` The way a lot of my songs are written - I write the music first , and I record it , and then with a song like ` Modern Guilt , ' I just get on the microphone and I write something really quick , sort of off the top of my head so I can remember the melody .
And what happens a lot of times is that what I initially sing on there ends up being on the record .
A lot of these things , I do n't really get to spend too much time figuring out what it is . ''
Danger Mouse insisted that Beck keep his original off-the-cuff lyrics that he 'd scribbled for this song .
The LA musician had written them to fill out the melody until he could come up with better ones .
Beck admitted to the Metro newspaper June 29 , 2008 : `` Probably most of the words on my record are scratch lyrics .
When it 's two in the morning you 're beyond exhausted and you just throw something down . ''
