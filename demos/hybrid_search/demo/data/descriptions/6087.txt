This adrenaline-fueled rocker was inspired by the death of two close friends of Gavin Rossdale and his wife Gwen Steffani .
The Bush frontman told Spin magazine about the song : `` It 's about when you look back on your life and eulogize or get nostalgic about where you 've been .
I lost a couple close friends this last year , one who committed suicide and one who overdosed .
It 's rough when you lose people unexpectedly .
It makes me wistful for more carefree days .
This song is about looking back and seeing yourself in the mirror .
You catch these moments when you think about what went down or what happened .
I would 've liked to have more time with those two people .
My friend Sean committed suicide while I was on the road .
That was really bad .
He was a close friend and a great inspiration , but I could n't make it back for the funeral .
So I wrote something and Gwen read it .
She stopped because it was too painful .
That shaped the album a lot .
Life is so precious but it 's easy to be a little bombastic and not appreciate it . ''
The song was meant to deal with the way that we sometimes view the past through rose-colored lenses .
