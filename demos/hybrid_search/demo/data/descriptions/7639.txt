The title track of Little Mix ' s debut album was penned by the girls with Iain James , who also co-wrote their hit single `` Wings . ''
English songwriting and record production team TMS produced the cut .
Their other credits include Professor Green ' s `` Read All About It '' and Dappy 's `` No Regrets . ''
Little Mix 's Jesy Nelson told Capital FM regarding the video : `` We were just so excited as well because it ' s completely different to ` Wings . '
Like ' Wings ' was fun and colourful and this is so dark and it 's just another side of Little Mix that people have n't seen yet and we 're so excited for everyone to see it .
`` Jade Thirlwall added : `` Well basically we took the theme of the song , the whole love and obsession thing , and just took it to an extreme . ''
The DNA album debuted at # 4 on the Billboard 200 chart .
In doing so , it marked the highest debut ever for a UK female group 's first set .
The Spice Girls previously held the record by bowing at # 6 with their debut , Spice in 1997 .
The accompanying music video sees the group hunting down a mysterious man in the city .
Talking about the clip , Little Mix ' s Jade Thirlwall told Sugarscape : `` It definitely matches the song , it ' s very dark and there ' s a bit of a twist on the story .
`` It is a love song , ` DNA , ' but we 've put a bit of a twist on it for the video . ''
DNA is a two-stranded informational molecule that contains , in chemically coded form , all the information needed to build , control and maintain living organisms .
Its chemical structure was established by Francis Crick and James Watson in 1953 whilst working at Cambridge University .
The DNA molecule consists of two linked strands that run in opposite directions to each other .
Watson said , `` A structure this pretty just had to exist . ''
Its proper name is Deoxyribonucleic Acid , but evidently Little Mix and James thought ` DNA ' would make a snappier title .
So why did Little Mix title their debut album after this song ?
Little Mix 's Perrie explained to Artist Direct : '' ` DNA ' was one of our favorite songs .
We thought it would be such a sick name for an album .
We believe that what we 're doing now was always in our DNA .
We were born for this .
We thought it was a nice title . ''
