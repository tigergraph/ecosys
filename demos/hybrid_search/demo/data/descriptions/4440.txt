The music and basic tune to this song was based upon `` Ooh Baby , Ooh -LRB- It 's Not Over -RRB- , '' an early Mick Jones composition that he wrote before The Clash formed in 1976 .
Their first attempt at recording it was during the Give 'Em Enough Rope sessions at Basing Street Studios in May 1978 , under the working title of `` Rusted Chrome . ''
The song came together in sessions in New York in September 1978 and finally completed at Wessex with engineer Bill Price -LRB- who went on to help produce the Clash albums London Calling and Sandinista ! -RRB- .
This was included on The Cost of Living EP , and was a fan favorite .
The Clash never played it live , however , which prompted one fan at a September 1979 concert at the New York Palladium to shout out a request for it .
Singer Joe Strummer answered by admitting they could n't play the song live because `` it 's a bit complicated ! ''
Clear influences on `` Gates of the West '' include `` Time Is Tight '' by Booker T and the MGs , of which the opening bass riff is very reminiscent -LRB- The Clash covered the song for the Black Market Clash rarities LP -RRB- , and Bruce Springsteen 's 1970s output .
The lyric , `` I should be jumpin ' and shoutin ' that I made it all this way , from Camden Town station to Fortieth and Eighth '' is a deliberate nod to Mott the Hoople 's `` All The Way From Memphis , '' which includes the line `` From the Liverpool Docks to the Hollywood Bowl . ''
