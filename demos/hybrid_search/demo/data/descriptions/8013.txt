Guitarist Bill Kelliher told The Skinny magazine that this song , `` has got a crazy melody with an even crazier guitar riff in the beginning there ` badda-doodle-noodle-badda-badda-noodle-noodle ... ' a lot of notes going on .
When we were tracking that song , I came up with the guitar riff that goes under the main vocals and the really busy guitar part .
So when Brent was singing and playing it he said ' I ca n't play the fast parts , we 're going to have to switch so I can sing and play .
You can play the crazy riff . '
I did n't think I could really do it , it 's all in his styling and it 's a very chicken-pickin ' kind of playing style .
But I got it down and it took a minute .
That was basically all for the sake of playing it live . ''
Quintessence is a hypothetical form of dark energy ; by which scientists attempt to explain the accelerating universe .
It was originally a fifth element postulated by the Ancient Greeks in addition to their understanding of the four existing elements of earth , air , fire and water .
They believed the cosmos and all celestial bodies were made of this element .
In the song the principal character of the storyline , who has had an out of body experience , gets sucked into a wormhole .
