On this slow Southern blues number , Alison Mosshart is toying with a lover .
Bass player Jack Lawrence described the writing process of Sea of Cowards to the Associated Press : `` All of us are writing in one room together .
We 're going in with nothing usually and sitting down and someone comes up with one part , and everybody else chimes in .
And Alison 's sitting over in the corner writing lyrics to it the whole time . ''
