British indie pop trio the xx began work on their sophomore album Coexist in November 2011 with the same writing process of Jamie Smith in charge of production duties , and singer-guitarist Romy Madley Croft and singer-bassist Oliver Sim penning the lyrics and melodies .
However , the latter pair approached the writing in a different way than their self-titled debut set .
`` Oliver and I used to write lyrics by exchanging ideas over e-mail , '' Madley Croft Spin magazine .
`` This time we actually worked together live in a room .
I think that means there 's more of an openness and vulnerability on the new album .
`` Smith 's role changed as well , as evidenced by such house-influenced tracks as this one .
`` He was much more involved earlier on with the songs , '' explained Madley Croft .
`` On the first album there were songs that we 'd written before he was really part of the band .
For the new songs , Jamie was able to take things in a different way rhythmically than he had before .
Our level of collaboration really grew . ''
During the BBC radio 1 documentary Night Time With the xx , Sim discussed how growing up had affected the lyric writing for Coexist .
`` Our first songs were fantastical experiences about love -- we were only 16 , we did n't know a lot and we had n't really gotten up to much , '' said Sim .
`` But as time went on it became about stuff we were going through .
I thought this new album would be like a diary , because now we 've actually had those experiences , but I 've actually found myself reverting more to the fantastical -- I 've been storytelling , writing about how things could play out in my head , rather than how they have . ''
This song represents Coexist 's heaviest groove .
`` It took the longest of all the songs on the album , '' said Madley Croft to Spin .
`` It began as a slightly more ballad-y thing with just me and Oliver , and then Jamie brought in a 909 drum machine . ''
