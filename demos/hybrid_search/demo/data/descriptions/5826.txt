This is the third single from American rapper Roscoe Dash 's debut album , The Juice .
The dirty version , which you are unlikely to hear on your local radio station , is called `` Good F -- kin ' Night . ''
The song was released on October 4 , 2011 .
Florida producer Kane Beatz supplied the song 's beat .
He has production credits on a number of hit singles including ones by Young Money -LRB- `` BedRock '' -RRB- , Trey Songz -LRB- `` Bottoms Up '' -RRB- and Nicki Minaj -LRB- `` Super Bass '' -RRB- .
Despite the song 's radio friendly electronic influence , Roscoe Dash did n't always see it as a potential hit .
`` When I first did the song ` Good Good Night , ' I loved the song but I did n't think it should be my first single until I went back in and added some stuff to the hook , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` I try to make every verse different with beat patterns and no repetitiveness whatsoever .
` Good Good Night ' is a new sound and new energy where there 's not a ` break your neck , bob your head ' -LSB- type of sound -RSB- , but just feel good music . ''
The EP title stands for `` Just Understand I Control Everything . ''
Dash told The Boombox his intention was to highlight the diversity of the record .
He explained : `` I 've been a very big feature artist for the last year-and-a-half and people only know me for doing the hooks and being the clean-up guy , last verse type of thing .
I felt like I needed to stand up on my own two feet and show people that I can do more than just that and do more than just the club thing , slow tempo with all the bass . ''
