3 Doors Down bass player Todd Harrell told us that this song is `` about a girl that 's full of love , and that 's really it . ''
The song could mean different things to different people though , as the band likes their songs to translate to whatever is in the mind of the listener .
Harrell explained : `` We try to write stories that everybody can relate to , something that you can listen to and get something out of different than when I listen to it .
We try to leave the songs open for interpretation and let everybody get something that they can write to out of it .
We 've always had a lot of success doing that .
A lot of our songs mean something to us different than what you get out of it . ''
