This was the title track of the English indie band The Maccabees second album .
Wall of Arms was produced by Markus Dravs -LRB- Bjork , Arcade Fire , Coldplay -RRB- .
The band worked on it in various cities including Liverpool and Paris .
Frontman Orlando Weeks told The Daily Mail May 1 , 2009 that this song is , `` a thank-you to the friends and family who have supported us . ''
The Maccabees took their moniker from second century BC Jewish rebels after flicking through a Bible and picking a random word .
Despite the religious connotations of their name , Weeks told BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq that none of the band is Jewish or Christian .
Indeed , some of their lyrics , such as the ones for this song include an atheistic theme .
