The title track and lead single from Sir Paul McCartney 's 16th studio album is a horn-driven Pop song that was produced by Mark Ronson .
The producer-DJ is known for his work with a host of luminaries , including Lady Gaga , Lily Allen , and the late Amy Winehouse .
Ronson emulates Beatle producer George Martin 's style with a short reprise at the end of this tune .
The song was given its first airing by Zoe Ball on August 29 , 2013 during her on BBC Radio 2 show .
Ronson first started working with McCartney after DJing his wedding to Nancy Shevell .
Later , he got a call from the former Beatle to come down to the studio and the pair started messing around with ideas .
Ronson told MTV News the first time he heard this track , he was sold .
`` It was just such an instant classic , '' he said .
`` I said , ' I would love to work on that song with you , ' and that 's how it started .
It was a masterclass in learning how to put together a f -- king incredible song - just watching his mind work . ''
When asked during a Twitter Q&A why he titled the album ` New , ' McCartney replied : `` I was playing around with more poetic titles but New was a simple word and the name of a song on the album . ''
Sir Paul told BBC 6 Music 's Matt Everitt about the song : `` It 's catchy , it 's summery , it 's a love song .
I think people will recognize it as definitely me . ''
He added : `` It 's a love song but it 's saying do n't look at me I have n't got any answers .
It says I do n't know what 's happening , I do n't know how it 's all happening , but it 's good and I love you . ''
McCartney told The Sun how the song was created : `` It is the kind of thing that I could have done with The Beatles , '' he said .
`` There was always one way to do that song .
It 's very piano based , one of those things that if I play it with just me , piano and voice , it will sound very close to a finished record . ''
`` It 's all in the piano part , '' McCartney added .
`` All the notes are in there .
I wrote it late one night at my dad 's piano and I had this little idea to get it down immediately on a little cassette machine with a Dictaphone .
I thought , ` This is good , this will work . '
It was just very quick inspiration . ''
