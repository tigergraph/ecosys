Los Angeles formed the inspiration for two songs on Donovan 's Sunshine Superman album : `` The Trip '' and this song .
Whilst the former was titled after a LA club where Donovan had a residency , this tune was named after The Mama 's and The Papa 's singer Mama Cass .
A cover version was recorded by Jefferson Airplane for their 1968 live album Bless Its Pointed Head .
