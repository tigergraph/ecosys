This is about drug use .
Ozzy did lots of drugs and alcohol until 1991 , when he went completely sober .
Randy Rhoads played guitar on this .
Diary Of A Madman is the last album Rhoads played on ; he died the next year while the band was touring in Florida .
Rhoads was in a small plane that started buzzing Ozzy 's tour bus .
It got too close , clipped the bus , and crashed into a house ; killing Rhoads , the pilot , and the tour hairdresser .
Rhoads wrote the music , Ozzy wrote the lyrics .
Vile covered this for the 1999 collection Land of the Wizard : A Tribute to Ozzy Osbourne .
-LRB- thanks , Brett - Edmonton , Canada -RRB- Although it was a big part of his life , few of Ozzy 's songs are about drugs .
`` Road To Nowhere , '' from 1991 , is about his life before he went sober , and 2 songs he did with Black Sabbath were about drugs , `` Snowblind '' -LRB- cocaine -RRB- and `` Sweet Leaf '' -LRB- Marijuana -RRB- .
This was included on Tribute , a double-album of live tracks featuring Rhoads on guitar .
Ozzy selected the tracks with the help of Rhoads ' mom , and released it in 1987 .
The album was digitally remastered and re-released in 2002 .
