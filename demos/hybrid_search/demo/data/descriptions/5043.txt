Vocalist Ryan Clark on bandsonfire.com about this song written from Demon Hunter 's Christian perspective : '' ` Fading Away ' is about waiting to hear a call from the Lord .
I think we , as Christians , can get caught up waiting on a specific word from God , all the while sitting stagnant and unproductive .
Sometimes it seems like we can slowly begin to fade away from the Lord as we wait for something to slap us in the face .
I think in many cases God wants us to take some necessary steps in order for His will to be revealed to us .
This song talks about how our own selfish attempt at life is likely to be ill fated , and how we so often live according to our own desires . ''
