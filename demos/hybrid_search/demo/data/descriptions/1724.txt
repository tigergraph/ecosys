While recording in New Orleans , Karen O 's husband Barbaby Clay sent the singer a list of ` Top 50 songs written about New York City . '
Karen told NME : `` He was like ` you got ta write one . '
I wrote this track , which is a love song set on the most New York City thing there is - the metro system . ''
This languidly yearning song utilizes the clanging sound of a train shunting along the subway tracks as an appropriate source of percussion .
The only previous song about the Big Apple that the Yeah Yeah Yeah 's had recorded was a B-side called `` Yeah , New York . ''
Karen O took up bass during the recording of Mosquito and that 's her playing the song 's swampy riffs .
