Lyrically , this song is the precursor to Hail To The King 's closing track , `` Acid Rain . ''
Guitarist Synyster Gates explained to MusicRadar.com : `` It 's about a meteoric , intergalactic war that results in an apocalypse and the human species aligning together to go fight something much better than us , our individual trials and tribulations . ''
Gates added : `` Musically , the song was incredibly difficult to write and pull off -- the elements of dissonance , tension and resolution .
We wanted to have that friction throughout , but it still had to be palatable ; it could n't be like listening to Penderecki or Stockhausen .
There had to be a relatability and connectability to it . ''
Vocalist M.Shadows commented to Kerrang !
magazine : `` This song is an intergalactic Darth Vader type thing -- it 's like the Imperial March with horns and a pure metal attack . ''
