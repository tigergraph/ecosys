This lament was released as the first single from American folk-rock singer-songwriter John Hiatt twentieth album Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns .
Hiatt 's career stretches back to the mid 1970s and despite several Grammy Award nominations , he has never cracked the top 40 of the singles or albums chart under his own name .
However , Three Dog Night did reach # 16 on the Hot 100 with one of his compositions `` Sure as I 'm Sittin ' Here '' in 1974 .
Hiatt explained his songwriting process in an interview with American Songwriter : `` I sit down to play the guitar , usually the acoustic , and some riff or chord progression will come out of it .
And then I 'll start singing a melody and because I do n't have words yet , I 'll sing nonsense .
If I 'm lucky then a line will come out of , just , the magic of songwriting I guess .
I do n't pretend to know what that is , but you know lines just pop out , like with ` Damn This Town . '
I had that first riff and then I went from E minor up to that C chord and I started singing ` Damn This Town .
I mean it this time , I made up my mind .
I 'm leaving .
I 've got ta get the hell out of here . '
And surely that 's dealing with the whole ` The grass is greener on the other side ' idea . ''
