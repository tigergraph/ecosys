Chris Brown was considered to record this song but the song 's writer Terius `` The-Dream '' Nash decided to give it to J.Holiday .
Brown was disappointed , he thought the song was his and there was an ensuing feud between the two .
Model Jennifer Gordon , Holiday 's girlfriend in the video , played the same role in the promo for his follow-up single `` Suffocate . ''
Gordon also featured in the video for Omarion 's `` O. '' J. Holiday says in Caught magazine : `` I actually did n't write ` Bed . '
Actually one of the cats that I wrote with on the album , his name is The-Dream , he wrote the song .
He also did the Rihanna song `` Umbrella . ''
Me and him worked together throughout the album , he has 2 other tracks on there too and I co-wrote one of those with him .
He already knew , he was like ' I have a joint for you , ' basically that 's what happened .
I told him I needed another record for the ladies but something that the fellas could ride to . ''
In an interview with Real Talk NY , Terius ` The-Dream ' Nash discussed the feud he had with Chris Brown over Nash not giving him this song : `` Before me and Chris even had a discussion we were talking to executives over there and it was just concerning certain lyrical content of the song and they wanted to change a lot of it .
And I was n't going to do that ; it would have put in jeopardy the integrity of the song based on trying to get it on an act that was 18 years old .
So , that was really the basis for whether or not the record was going to go to him or not , and he basically took it in a whole other direction and put another spin on it .
But that 's basically what happened . ''
