We know that Enter Shikari rage about all sorts of topics on their songs .
However , despite this track 's title , they have n't resorted to getting stroppy with temperature measurement devices - the lyrics are actually about the ancient Bristlecone pine trees that are found in America .
Here 's what singer Rou Reynolds told Kerrang !
: `` They are some of the oldest trees in the world - and have a natural record of temperature in their rings .
It 's about the insanity of energy companies and the lengths they go to increase their short-term profits .
It 's quite an angry song . ''
The song takes issue with the oil companies drilling in the ice caps .
Reynolds told Kerrang !
: `` We 've spent the last century squeezing the world for all its natural resources , and now that we 're running out of them , we 're turning to the Arctic for our last hit .
It 's the most infuriatingly short-sighted behavior .
What are we gon na do once we 've finished plundering the Arctic ? ''
The song 's music video features Reynolds as news reporter Phillis McCleaveland .
The singer recalled to NME : `` It was filmed in a really bad area in the Bronx and there was me dressed as an '80s - style Anchorman character ! ''
Reynolds told Kerrang !
May 25 , 2013 : `` The title comes from a place of frustration - seeing sceptics arguing there 's no truth behind climate change .
How do you argue with a thermometer ? ''
