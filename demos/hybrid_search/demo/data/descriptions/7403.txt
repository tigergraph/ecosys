This song has been described as a Gospel Ballad .
Written by the fledgling team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin , produced by Gus Dudgeon on Dick James Music , running to 3 minutes 22 seconds and backed by `` Bad Side Of The Moon , '' `` Border Song '' was the first single from the Elton John album .
It was released March 20 , 1970 , and although some consider it superior to the much hyped `` Your Song '' from the same album which was released as a single the following year , it failed to make the charts .
In the same book , when it was pointed out that some people have suggested `` Border Song '' is anti-Semitic , Bernie laughed : `` Do n't ask me why , I do n't know .
Most of my friends are Jewish .
I married one . ''
He did indeed , and his first wife was the inspiration for the song `` Tiny Dancer . ''
A quarter of a century later , Elton had a more plausible explanation for the song 's inspiration .
In His Song : The Musical Journey of Elton John , he told Elizabeth Rosenthal it was about the alienation confirmed country boy Bernie felt when he was in London .
The same alienation inspired him to pen the words to `` Tell Me When The Whistle Blows '' from the 1975 Captain Fantastic album .
Elton John was the singer 's second album , and it was a huge leap forward from his first effort Empty Sky .
Speaking with Rolling Stone in 2011 , Elton said : `` I 'd finally found my own voice , and the seismic change was happening in Bernie 's lyrics .
And recording Elton John was a terrifying step , because I had to play live with an orchestra , and we had a # 5,000 budget , so we had to do three tracks in the morning and three in the afternoon .
I was really frightened , I did n't want to mess up and that steeled me .
It gave me great fortitude for the rest of my life . ''
In the 1975 publication A Conversation with Elton John and Bernie Taupin , by Paul Gambaccini , Elton said he wrote the last verse because it was only two verses long , and needed a third .
His contribution was `` very mundane '' he added .
Gambacinni asked : `` Is that the only verse of a song you 've written ? ''
To which Elton replied : `` Oh , yes .
`` This is not quite true ; Elton wrote songs on his own before he met Bernie but was never satisfied with his lyrics .
`` Border Song '' was also recorded by Aretha Franklin , who with her Gospel roots seems a more obvious choice of performer .
