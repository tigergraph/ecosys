Big TV is a concept album about a girl who 's in a relationship with a guy in an unidentified provincial European area who moves to a much bigger , more glamorous city , This song finds the girl reunited with her boyfriend , but for how long ?
Bassist and lyricist Charles Cave explained to NME : `` Even though she 's back , he does n't consider her to be back for good .
She 's got an itch built in to her -- she 'll always be digging for gold . ''
McVeigh expanded on the song 's meaning to Artist Direct : `` The basic narrative of the record is about a girl who leaves her hometown .
It 's implied it 's somewhere in Europe , perhaps Eastern Europe .
She moves to a big city , and it 's implied the big city is in the States .
She leaves her hometown thinking she 's going to make this great new modern life for herself .
Actually , it turns out that does n't happen , and she moves back home .
It 's about her digging in the ` Goldmine , ' trying to live the dream , and earn money .
It 's not working out though .
She leaves a guy back at home , and it 's also his view as well .
That 's my interpretation . ''
This was the last song that White Lies wrote for Big TV .
Vocalist Harry McVeigh told Artist Direct : `` It came together from parts of other tracks , but it was quite a spontaneous moment in the studio with a couple of days left .
It came out of us playing in the room together with a melody in mind .
That was it . ''
