This is the second single from Canadian Hip-Hop artist Drake 's debut album , Thank Me Later .
The track was produced by Kanye West and features Drake singing about rescuing a relationship .
Drake previously worked with the Gold Digger artist on the all star MC gathering `` Forever , '' and West directed the video for `` Best I Ever Had . ''
The music video , which is a story of forbidden love and betrayal , was shot in Kingston , Jamaica during the week of April 12 , 2010 .
It was helmed by Anthony Mandler , director of the `` Over '' clip .
The video features dancehall artist Mavado as the gang leader , and Drake 's real life squeeze , professional model Maliah Michel , plays the leading lady .
Drake told MTV News : `` We went to Kingston .
We went to this ` hood .
They call it the ` gully ' side .
It 's bad out there , real bad .
They had ` Young Money ' sprayed on the gates , ` Drake and Wayne , ' 'cause I came to shoot the video out there .
I 'm talking about you drive by people 's homes , they had ` Drake , ' ` Young Money , ' ` Drake , Welcome Here , ' ` Drake We Love You ' - crazy sh -- , man .
It was so crazy .
This dude was like , ` Original Weezy tha God !
You tha boss !
Weezy tha God ! '
It 's crazy .
They love us , 'cause we show love out there . ''
In an interview with MTV News , Drake said he hopes men will understand the song stating : `` I look for love in the wrong people .
It just always seem like the women I find are poison for me .
I love women that can just walk into a room and stop the whole area .
And I think that those initial qualities always end up getting me hurt , which is a crazy thing for a guy to say .
` Find Your Love ' is an extremely vulnerable song .
And it 's actually a huge risk .
It almost feels like the song should be performed by a woman .
I 'm just hoping that men really hear the song and they 're honest with themselves .
I know a lot of men feel that way . ''
The video elicited a response from Jamaica 's official Minister of Tourism , who said : `` Care has to be taken by all , including our creative artistes , in portraying images of our destination and people .
Gun culture , while not unique to Jamaica , is not enhancing -LSB- the island 's image -RSB- . ''
