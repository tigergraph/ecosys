This song is about wondering why people do the things they do .
We seem to `` stumble through our lives : reach for a hand to hold . ''
We do n't really know what we are doing , we just blindly make decisions in our lives .
He is saying that we waste time doing silly things like talking too much even if the words do n't matter in an effort to fill awkward silences .
Or spending all of our time searching for `` The One '' instead of letting love just come into our lives .
He does n't understand why these things seem to be important in the long run .
