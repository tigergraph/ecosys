This song is about men who have nothing going for them , but hit on women just the same , even resorting to hopeless tactics like hollering at women from the passenger seat of their friend 's car .
The song vaulted the term `` Scrub '' into the popular lexicon , and it became a well-used word to describe a worthless man .
This was the first single released from Fanmail , the followup to TLC 's wildly successful second album CrazySexyCool , which sold over 11 million copies .
`` No Scrubs '' kept them in the groove and was a major hit .
The song was a no-brainer for radio stations , as it was a fresh sound from an established group that had already made the R&B , Pop and Adult Contemporary charts .
A smooth , mid-tempo number with a very memorable title , it found a home on all these formats , as did their next single , `` Unpretty . ''
The group Sporty Thievz released a response song from the male perspective called `` No Pigeons . ''
This renewed the popularity of `` No Scrubs '' as radio stations played the songs back-to-back .
This won Grammys for Best Rhythm & Blues Song and for Best Rhythm & Blues Performance by a Group .
Future Real Housewives of Atlanta cast member Kandi Burruss wrote this with help from producer Kevin `` She ` kspere '' Briggs , and Tameka `` Tiny '' Cottle .
Burruss and Cottle were members of the recently disbanded group Xscape , who had a hit in 1993 with `` Just Kickin ' It , '' and they had formed their own duo , which they called KAT -LRB- Kandi And Tameka -RRB- .
Briggs was an up-and-coming producer at LaFace records , home of TLC , and he had written what would become `` No Scrubs , '' but with completely different lyrics .
After meeting Briggs through their manager , Burruss and Cottle asked if they could try writing different lyrics to the song , which they then hoped to record .
Burruss got the `` No Scrubs '' idea after talking about some of her ex-boyfriends - she and her friends used the word `` Scrubs '' a lot .
She and Cottle finished the new lyrics and took them to Briggs , who instead of putting the song together for KAT , brought it to LaFace where the execs decided it would be a great song for TLC .
Burruss , who had songwriting aspirations but did n't write in Xscape , was hesitant about giving up the song , but knew it was the right thing to do .
It worked out well for her , as even though her singing career wound down , she became a popular songwriter , later teaming up with Briggs to write another man-basher : `` Bills , Bills , Bills '' for Destiny 's Child .
The word `` scrub '' has developed many uses , including what you do to rid your computer of viruses or remove items from a budget .
`` Scrubs '' are what hospital workers wear , and a show with that name debuted on NBC in 2001 .
This song is heavy on the `` C '' and light on the `` T '' and `` L. '' It was the first TLC song that Chilli -LRB- Rozanda Thomas -RRB- , sang lead on by herself ; T-Boz -LRB- Tionne Watkins -RRB- did most of their lead vocals to that point .
Kevin Briggs is the one who decided she would sing on it , and he worked with her to get the vocal down .
He thought her vocal range was right for the track , and liked the idea of having her get her first lead .
`` We had some resistance from the other girls at one point , but we ended up working it out , '' said Briggs .
This song is TLC 's biggest seller in the UK , selling 553,200 copies .
