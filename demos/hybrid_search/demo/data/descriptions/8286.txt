This is a track from British alternative rock band Echo & The Bunnymen .
's eleventh studio album , The Fountain .
McCulloch expanded on this track in publicity materials : `` The song is a kind of conversation with Jesus .
Its tongue-in-cheek , but its also just another way of praying .
It was based around a gig in Rimini at a club called , I think , The Transylvania , and I saw this image in the monitors , it was Jesus ' face .
I stopped the song , and said , If you all want to file past , you can see the Shroud Of Turin .
Its also a play on urine , he pissed his keks on the cross .
That urine stained shroud in Rimini . ''
Frontman Ian McCulloch told Mojo magazine June 2008 about this slice of Bowie-ish pop , in which he comes face-to-face with Christ : `` Shroud of Turin is about me and Jesus .
We get on pretty well . ''
