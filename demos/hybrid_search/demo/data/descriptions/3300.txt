The song refers to frontman Scott Weiland 's past history of drug use .
Guitarist Dean DeLeo admitted to Musicradar.com : `` Well , we all know what the bagman brings , do n't we ?
-LSB- pauses -RSB- It 's about Scott 's dealings with certain people and , well , it can get pretty dark and bleak out there sometimes . ''
Dean DeLeo commented to Musicradar.com on the jingly tune , which contrasts with the dark lyrics : `` The yin-yang thing in the band is always there .
Musically , I was somewhere else .
As the guitarist , it was very interesting painting with these bright colors and using certain Tele tones .
Since I was in my teens , I 've been such a fan of that cool single-coil sound and playing a lot of jangly chord patterns .
I 'm pretty happy with my solo - it 's a real twister . ''
