Moore explained this song to Great American Country : `` It 's obviously tongue-in-cheek .
It 's not serious , like I 'm really going to whip somebody 's ass .
It 's become a staple of our show .
It 's more or less about a guy who has all the money in the world and he thinks that is going to allow him to just take your girl and take over your world .
But the bottom line is , you might have all the money and the cars , but I can whip your ass .
Obviously it 's a fun song to do live .
We close the show with it and we 've had a couple of hits .
That song holds its own with the radio hits we have . ''
