This song is a blend of two different styles : Mariachi and Reggae .
It started as a Reggae riff , and vocalist Dexter Holland told Spinner that after `` a little drum '' was added to it , `` we were bopping our heads , and we let the thing roll . ''
The band kept going back to the song and eventually decided , `` it would be really interesting to have Mariachi in there .
`` Guitarist Noodles added : `` It was really hard to get those two musical styles to blend , but once we figured out how to get them to fit right with each other , it was great .
Reggae is usually sitting on the beach kind of vibe .
This song has some menace to it . ''
Holland explained the track 's meaning to Spinner : `` The song talks about how Orange County can be a dangerous place .
I 've lived here my whole life , and I 've commuted up to L.A. so I 've definitely been through the bad neighborhoods daily .
It 's dangerous , but it 's fun at the same time . ''
