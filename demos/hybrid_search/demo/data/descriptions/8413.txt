The line , `` Any other day and I might play a funeral march for Bonnie Brae '' indicates that this may be a song about heroin use , since the corner of Bonnie Brae and 6th Street is where singer Anthony Kiedis would go to buy heroin , as told in his Autobiography .
Also , the line `` Slow Cheetah come , it 's so euphoric , no matter what they say '' may refer to the euphoric feeling one gathers from a heroin high , as Anthony always described it .
