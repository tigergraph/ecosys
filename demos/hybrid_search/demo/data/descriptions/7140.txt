This is a track from the Los Angeles Rap-Rock band Hollywood Undead 's second studio album American Tragedy .
The song was released for a free download on February 5 , 2011 .
Hollywood Undead vocalist Johnny 3 Tears explained the song 's meaning to Artist Direct : `` It 's definitely a Hollywood song .
In a sense , Hollywood Undead actually represents ` Been To Hell . '
Title-wise , it 's about the people who come in and out of Hollywood .
It 's a focal point of the world for all the wrong reasons .
People care more about Hollywood than they do about Washington , D.C. where laws are made and things are dictated throughout our lives .
The general public give more of a s -- t about what 's going on here , what movies are being made , etc. .
People move to Hollywood hoping to advance their lives in some sense .
They want to make music , or they want to become actors or actresses .
Time and time again , they fail .
They come here trying to realize their dreams and they learn that is n't the way it works for everybody.I 'm commenting on it from an observant standpoint seeing it for so many years .
The majority of these people do n't make the cut , and they usually pack their bags or look for a different life that was n't what they dreamed of when they came there .
You 're a bartender , a street cleaner , or whatever the f -- k you do , and it was n't what you came here intending to do .
Or , you shell off and go home .
It 's our observation of that lifestyle .
These people get off the bus here and things do n't exactly work out how they thought .
I understand it must be heartbreaking for those people .
However , it 's kind of a f -- k you to them in the sense of saying , `` What 'd you think was going to happen ? ''
That 's how I think of it . ''
The album title is taken from a line in this song : `` And I 'll never let you go , cuz I know you 'll come back to me/I 'm the reason you came here , I 'm the American Tragedy . ''
