Singer/songwriter/guitarist Daniel Rossen recalled to Drowned in Sound : `` I remember that even before we started recording this song we talked about how it seemed like a great opening track .
It had a positive spirit to it that reminded me of the end of ` On A Neck , On A Spit ' -LRB- from the 2006 album Yellow House -RRB- .
Both those songs involved some time wandering around near the beach up at the Cape -LRB- Cod -RRB- , strumming the guitar line over and over in order to find a melody . ''
Ed Droste -LRB- also Singer/songwriter/guitarist -RRB- added that this was recorded at both Cape Cod , Massachusetts , and in a New York church .
He explained : `` Actually the last song to be recorded and written .
Started on the cape and finished up in the church and went through various different permutations . ''
