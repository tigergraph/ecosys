The song is based on the Big Pink anthem `` Dominoes , '' which reached # 27 on the UK singles chart at the end of October 2009 and strips away the lines about pulling women replacing them with a message of Nicki hanging out with her sisters .
It also interpolates Shabba Ranks ' 1991 dancehall track `` Trailar Load a Girls . ''
