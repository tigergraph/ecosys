-LSB- laughs -RSB- I do n't know , I feel like people will say , `` You turned Hollywood , '' 'cause that 's how they wan na make you feel ; I feel normal still , and if they 're makin ' me feel different it 's because that 's what what they 're doin ' .

It 's not like I 'm acting any differently , it 's just kind hard when you 're on the road all the time and not able to be home as much . ''
