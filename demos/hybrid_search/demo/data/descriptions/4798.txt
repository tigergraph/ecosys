Chris Knight was working as a songwriter in Nashville when he came up with this song , which ended up as a single from his debut album .
Knight wrote it with Craig Wiseman , whose extensive credits include Blake Shelton 's `` Hillbilly Bone '' and Tim McGraw 's `` The Cowboy in Me . ''
The song is about feeling out of place ; it resonated with many listeners who could relate to the feeling of breaking free from the bounds of society.When we spoke with Chris Knight in 2012 , he told us about coming up with the song : `` I do n't know what inspired me to write it , but I remember sitting down and hollering out the first couple of lines one morning before I went to work .
I 'd get up early in the morning and I 'd get me a cup of coffee and I 'd start writing .
And I remember hollering out saying the first couple of lines of ` Ai n't Easy Being Me , ' and then setting it aside .
And then I took it down and showed it to Craig Wiseman and then we just took off from there .
He liked the idea and everything , so we went from there . ''
Artists to cover this song include John Anderson , Randy Dukes , and Blake Shelton .
Knight 's original version stalled because his record label , Decca , folded soon after it was released , making the song a promotional orphan .
Before they went out of business , it looked like Decca was going to support the single and get it some radio play - they did make a music video for the song which was quite clever , using a demolition derby to represent the self-destructive behavior of the singer .
