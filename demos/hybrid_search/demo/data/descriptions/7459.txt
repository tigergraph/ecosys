`` Human Nature '' was originally written by Steve Porcaro , keyboardist with the Rock band Toto .
`` I had written the song for my daughter Heather .
Something had happened at school and it just inspired me .
I wrote the song while we were mixing `` Africa '' and was just tinkering on the piano and wrote ` Human Nature . '
It was one of a batch of three songs I had written in a certain time period .
I had written the lyrics , which were the same verse I was singing over and over again .
I had the ` why , why ' chorus with the slap echo .
Like most of my songs it was an unfinished song . ''
The Jazz legend Miles Davis recorded this song in 1985 .
Steve Porcaro was thrilled when he first heard Miles ' version of his tune .
`` My father was a jazz musician and when I was growing up , most of the music we heard in our household was classical music and jazz - Miles Davis .
He was my father 's hero .
My brother Jeff learnt to play drums listening to ` Bag 's Groove . '
Miles Davis was ingrained in all of us , so I was completely thrilled .
I was so honored .
I remember doing a session with the bassist Neil Stubenhaus about six months after Miles did You 're Under Arrest .
He just cornered me and said ` do you realize how great it is to have Miles do one of your tunes ?
Do you have any idea what it means ? '
I certainly did .
It 's one of the things I 'm most proud of out of everything I 've done . ''
This was one of 7 US Top 10 hits off the Thriller album .
On November 7 , 2008 , Britney Spears and Madonna performed this at Madonna 's Dodger Stadium concert in Los Angeles .
Justin Timberlake also performed at the show , joining Madonna on stage for `` 4 Minutes . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- Steve Porcaro and fellow Toto member David Paich worked with producer Quincy Jones on the Thriller album , doing some synthesizer programming and playing .
Said Porcaro : `` Quincy had been asking David for songs and he was sending a messenger almost every day to David 's house - where I was living at the time - to pick up anything David was working on .
And so David was sending him stuff .
One time , he had gotten a call that the messenger was on his way and he called down to me and told me to throw something we 'd been working on onto a cassette .
I did n't have any blank cassettes , so I took a cassette that had ` Human Nature ' on one side and turned the B-side over , rewound it and put on these two songs of David 's .
and then gave them to the messenger .
`` Jones played both sides of the cassette and was excited about `` Human Nature . ''
Quincy called David the next day and was raving about this tune that went ` why , why . '
It took David half an hour to tell Quincy that it was n't his song !
But the song was incomplete lyric-wise and Jones asked Porcaro to finish them .
Porcaro recalls : `` I forced myself to write the lyrics and Quincy was less than thrilled with them and he asked me if I would mind if he brought in John Bettis to finish them .
I was completely thrilled with what John did with the lyrics . ''
In 1985 , Miles moved to Warner Brothers records and teamed with Porcaro to record new material for his first Warner album .
They went to Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro 's studio -LRB- The Villa -RRB- and tried recording `` Exist '' and `` Walk of Life , '' but the sessions were unsuccessful .
While at The Villa , Miles ended up playing on the Toto tune `` Do n't Stop Me Now . ''
-LRB- Thanks to George Cole , author of The Last Miles : The Music of Miles Davis , 1980-1991 , for all above .
Cole interviewed Steve Porcaro for the book . -RRB-
In 1993 , SWV -LRB- Sisters With Voices -RRB- hit # 2 in the US with a medley of this song combined with their own release `` Right Here . ''
Sheryl Crow performed with Michael Jackson on his Bad tour , joining him on stage for `` The Way You Make Me Feel '' and `` I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You . ''
In 2010 , she told Rolling Stone , `` My favorite memory of Michael was watching him do ` Human Nature ' every night .
he 'd cry , and those tears were so directly linked to the wounds that drove him to anesthetize himself . ''
