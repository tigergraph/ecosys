When asked by NME what his favorite lyric is from his eponymous debut album , Jake Bugg replied : `` I guess , if there was one to pick out , it would be ` Stuck in speedbump city ' from ` Trouble Town , ' because I had that line in my head for ages , but I never knew how to put it into a song . ''
This was released as the lead single from Jake Bugg 's eponymous album on March 4 , 2012 .
The singer recalled in a video track by track : `` What happened I was in the studio with Iain -LRB- Archer , producer -RRB- and we 'd accidentally left the microphone on , '' he said .
`` It was just that sound and we sent it over to the label , and they said ` great , we 'll put it on the record , ' I was like ' I want to record it again . '
They took it to the radio and Radio 1 started playing it .
I just could n't imagine it being played on there , I was quite baffled and surprised , it did what it needed to do . ''
