British dubstep singer Katy B penned this song with the drum and bass / breakstep Producer DJ Zinc and Rinse FM founder Geeneus .
It is the earliest penned track to appear on her On a Mission album and she told Artist Direct , `` It has a special place in my heart and is quite a flirtatious song .
It 's soulful and kind of just rolls out . ''
Prior to the release of her debut album , Katy used to close her sets with this song when she was on tour .
`` We would perform that last and I would introduce band to audience and they 'd do a solo over it , '' she recalled to Artist Direct .
