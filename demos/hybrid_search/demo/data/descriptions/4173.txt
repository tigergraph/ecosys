This is the first single from contemporary Christian music singer songwriter Natalie Grant 's eighth album , Love Revolution .
Grant 's record company originally released `` Greatness of Our God '' as the first single , but after she performed `` Human '' at the Dove Awards , stations began playing it instead and Curb switched support to the latter track .
`` I did n't think it should be our first single , '' Grant said of `` Greatness of Our God '' to Billboard magazine .
`` I did n't feel like it 's a true representation of what the record is about .
While there are plenty of worship songs on the record , I felt like ` Love Revolution ' is such a strong action type of message that I felt that -LSB- `` Greatness '' -RSB- did n't totally capture the whole passion behind the album .
I really felt that way about ` Human . ' ''
