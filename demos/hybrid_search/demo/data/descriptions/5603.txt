This is the title track from English R&B singer and former Floetry member Marsha Ambrosius ' debut solo album .
She explained the title to MTV News : `` It goes with the lifestyle , it 's the grind .
It 's late nights in the studio , it 's early mornings of having to get on the Acela and get up to New York and do interviews .
Late night , early mornings : it 's the life of an artist , but I think everyone can relate to that . ''
Ambrosius then conceded there is a sensual connotation to it as well , `` The sensual aspect came into it when I wrote the record ` Late Nights & Early Mornings . '
-LSB- I was thinking -RSB- , ` Ooh , it 's gon na be a late night , early morning when I get you home . ' ''
