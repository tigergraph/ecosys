Although he 's not a Pop guy , The Used bassist Jeph Howard tells us that `` Give Me Love '' was inspired by his love of Hip-Hop and Latin-based music .
Howard says he 's into `` anything with a solid beat . ''
Jeph says it 's the song on their Vulnerable album that he most enjoys playing live .
One week before The Used 's 2012 album Vulnerable came out , the music magazine Kerrang !
streamed this song on its website as a preview to the new album .
The band wrote this before they went in the studio to record their Vulnerable album .
They recorded a demo version of the song before the official sessions , and the final product did n't change much .
Jeph says the original title was `` Monster , '' but during the recording process , their songs titles often change .
