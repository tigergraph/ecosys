Ciara explained this tongue-in-cheek track in an interview with The Boombox : `` I have to be honest , I 'm shy about this .
In reality when I 'm with my girls and sometimes we see a guy , and it does n't mean that we mean this term literally , you just see a guy and you be like , ` ooh he can get it , ' '' she said of the song .
`` So , ` You Can Get It ' is really fun and playful .
I really love it .
It 's very melodic , it 's just another one of those things that 's real that I think we 're all shy about .
We would never publicly be like ` oh so and so could get it ' but when we get with ourselves we are like , ` Girl , he is so fine , he can get it . ''
