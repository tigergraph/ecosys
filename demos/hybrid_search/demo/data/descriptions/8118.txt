Sam Duckworth -LRB- aka Get Cape Wear Cape Fly -RRB- told ilikemusic.com that he had fun laying down this track : ' `` The Children Are -LSB- The Consumers Of -RSB- The Future ' was another track I had a lot of fun making , simply because of how we did it .
A lot of that track was done at 5am after the Christmas party , we 'd all stayed up and had a lot going on in the studio and we just decided to go back and whack a few bits on the tracks and a lot of the crazy distorted horns we recorded early in the morning and then , during the day , fed them through delays and messed around with the sounds we 'd made .
It was a couple of days at the end of a fairly long stretch of recording and it was just good fun to let our hair down and experiment and just play , which I think gives that track a sense of fun and a sense of interest . ''
