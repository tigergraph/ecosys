Vocalist James Mercer sings on this electronica-flexed slice of indie-folk .
`` One Dead land 's collided .
You pour your life down the rifle 's spiral and show us you 've earned it . ''
He explained the lyric during an interview on the NPR radio network : `` I was thinking about religious violence and what it must be like to be in a situation where it seems that your fate has brought you to battle . ''
