Far less condemning than Aerosmith 's other child abuse song , Janie 's Got A Gun , `` Uncle Salty '' was written by the group 's bass player Tom Hamilton and lead singer Steven Tyler .
In the Aerosmith biography Walk The Way , Tyler explains it was `` just a fantasy I had of being a madame , the boss of a bordello : work with the girls , hire and fire , keep things running .
Salty worked in a home for lost children and had his way with this little girl .
That 's what it 's about .
I 'm the little girl , the orphaned boy .
I put myself in that place .
I 'm Uncle Salty too . ''
Tom Hamilton , the band 's bassist , plays rhythm guitar on this song .
