James told Artist Direct that this song `` is about burning a guy 's house down after he has cheated on you or not been good to you . ''
She added : `` I do n't know if a lot of pop artists sing about that , but I wanted to .
I think if a guy does you wrong , you should just burn his house down -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
In the second verse , I 'm telling the sheriff he was not very good to me what do you expect me to do ?
Message out to guys : do n't date me ; I 'm crazy -LSB- Laughs -RSB- . ''
