This song seems to be about the things people do in order to make themselves feel good .
The song seems to focus on the darker side of pleasure like addictions and habits , but then the chorus comes in and it seems to say that you should stop thinking about what makes you feel good and try to love others to make them feel good .
It 's saying that love is what makes the world go around , hence the windmill reference .
