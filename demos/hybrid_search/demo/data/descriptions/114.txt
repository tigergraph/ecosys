The first single from LeAnn Rimes ' fourteenth studio album , Spitfire , chronicles her film set romance with her Northern Lights co-star , Eddie Cibrian , when both were already married .
`` I carried the title around with me for about eight months , because I was so unsure of how to write it without offending anyone , '' Rimes told journalist Katie Couric of the song .
`` I had to be so honest in order to write it ... I call myself ` pathetic ' in the song because that 's exactly the way I felt .
It was just a pathetic situation .
It 's like , ` LeAnn , how did you get yourself into the situation ? '
Then there 's this other side of me going , ' I love this man with all my heart and he loves me , and this is so complicated . ' ''
Rimes debuted the song on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno on December 18 , 2012 .
She explained to the chat show host that despite being borne of a specific situation , the tune has a universal theme .
`` This song , the chorus says , ' I do n't want to give you back , ' '' she said .
`` A lot of people who have n't been in this situation can relate because there 's got to be a relationship in their lives - romantic or not - that it just kills to give it up .
It 's a very intimate look into a very rough moment in my life . ''
Another Spitfire track , `` What Have I Done , '' was supposed to be the first official single but this song was released to radio first , due to an overwhelming fan demand .
X Factor Extra 's Terri Seymour caught up with Rimes backstage after she sung on the show 's second season finale .
She asked the singer about Cibrian 's reaction to this song .
Rimes replied ; `` He is always so supportive , I actually was scared to put him in the song because it does talk about how we both hurt each other .
There was a moment where we did have some hurt between the two of us that we had to accept and get over and move forward and that 's made for an amazing relationship . ''
