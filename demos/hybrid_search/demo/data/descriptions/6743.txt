Kevin Brereton , who records under the name of k-os , is a Canadian alternative hip hop artist and record producer .
His stage name is an acronym for `` Knowledge of Self . ''
This song is the third single from his fourth album , Yes ! .
K-os explained to Jam !
Music that though he is a fan of Natalie Portman , this song is more about her homeland than anything else .
`` I think Natalie Portman is the best America has to offer , the ideal that America has to offer , '' said k-os .
`` I think it 's my subversive thing on , ` Go south , Kevin . '
I was afraid of America for a long time .
When I toured , I opened for a band called Gym Class Heroes , and it was the first time I went to Alabama , Oklahoma , New Orleans .
It blew my mind because I had considered myself a fairly well-read , intelligent person -LRB- but I -RRB- had all these preconceived notions about America based on press and I was meeting amazing people every time , every night , so that and Obama becoming president , totally made me cut ties with fear of America .
So I Wish I Knew Natalie Portman over this California beat is kind of like I 'm ready to sort of immerse myself in that .
Maybe it 's not really necessarily about being a superfan of a beautiful woman . ''
The song features Canadian rapper Saukrates and singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado and samples `` California '' by Phantom Planet .
Artist Direct asked k-os if Natalie Portman has heard this track .
He replied : `` She has !
A friend of mine who works for Entertainment Tonight in Canada was interviewing her for the Toronto Film Fest .
At the end of the interview , he was like , ` Have you heard of K-Os ? '
She responded , ` Yes , I have . '
So he said , ` Do you know he has a song called , `` I wish I knew Natalie Portman ? ' ''
She laughed in a humble but embarrassed way about it .
She knows the song exists .
It was cool of my friend to ask her that . ''
