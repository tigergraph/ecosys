This paean to mortality is one of guitarist Ryan Jarman 's on the In The Belly Of The Brazen Bull album .
His bassist brother Gary commented to NME regarding the set : `` Ryan 's definitely propagating the fact that it 's -LSB- the album as a whole -RSB- more back to basics .
At least in our approach to things I would say it is , as it 's just the three of us doing whatever comes naturally and writing quite swiftly .
Having said that some of the songs like ` Back To The Bolthole ' and all of the Abbey Road stuff -LSB- the final four songs -RSB- and ` Confident Men ' are a progression on the previous record .
I think it 's a little confusing , back to basics in its approach and its ideal , but I still like to consider it a progression . ''
Ryan explained to NME that the opening line , `` You follow Aurora , '' refers to a boulevard in Seattle called Aurora .
He added : `` We used to take these road trips down the Northwest and we found ourselves here quite a lot .
On these trips we wanted to feel like we were existing outside society , under the radar . ''
Ryan Jarman wrote the song 's chorus before its verses .
He explained its meaning to NME : `` When we were writing the last record , it made me aware of getting older , mortality , coming to terms with it , not letting it dictate the way you live your life or letting it bother you .
You ca n't do anything about it so you 're better off forgetting about it .
Sometimes you go through phases when it 's really troubling you , the fact that you 're going to die . ''
