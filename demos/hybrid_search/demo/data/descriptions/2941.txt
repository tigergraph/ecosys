This searing indictment of today 's consumerist society was one of three tracks on Hara Kiri penned by Tankian on his iPad .
He explained to Spinner : `` I took tracks from my previous records , made loops out of them , and used these loops as construction material to design new songs .
It was musical recycling if you will .
The iPad is such a great musical tool .
I was just messing around and came up with sketches for three of the songs . ''
Spinner asked Tankian if he saw the irony in using such a beloved device of our consumerist society as a production tool ?
He replied : `` If you 're looking for irony , you can find it anywhere -LSB- laughs -RSB- .
Utilizing an iPad to write a song is no different from using acoustic guitar or piano .
As a songwriter , you always want to change and progress , and while I 'm not endorsing the Apple corporation in any way , it is a useful tool .
Consumerism is part of our life ; there 's blind consumerism , and then there 's consumer awareness .
They are very different things . ''
