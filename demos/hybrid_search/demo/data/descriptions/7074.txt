South Louisiana born Lelia Broussard is described as a sultry , soulful pop artist .
Her music is rooted in her Southern heritage , but having moved to Philadelphia in her teens , she has taken influences from the Philly soul sound .
Her debut EP , Louisiana Soul , written and recorded when Lelia was just 15 got extensive airplay on University of Pennsylvania 's 88.5 WXPN .
Ultimately , two of Lelia 's songs , `` Secrets '' and `` Should Have Known '' , from that first EP , were featured on two episodes of Joan of Arcadia on CBS-TV .
Broussard has since transplanted to Los Angeles .
The Molly Green and James Lefler directed video was shot in a seedy theater in Koreatown , Los Angeles , and features Broussard 's trademark face paint .
She told Spinner UK : `` My album is called Masquerade and I wanted to have some sort of visual element to represent that when I played live and when I did photo shoots . ''
This is the title track from Broussard 's second album .
Broussard told Spinner UK that the song is about `` people who parade around like they are someone very different from who they actually are . ''
