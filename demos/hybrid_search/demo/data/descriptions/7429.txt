Toby Keith wrote this with the singer-songwriter Eddy Raven , who was one of his heroes during his youth .
Amongst their previous collaborations was the 2008 track `` Cabo San Lucas . ''
Keith recalled the story of this song : `` Eddy has come out here several times on the road and written several songs with me .
We 've had a lot of fun and written some really , really good songs .
` South of You ' was an idea that he had about getting on a boat and not knowing where I 'm gon na ' end up but it 'll be ` somewhere south of you . '
I jumped in the middle of it with him and we started saying : there 's a lot of places I could go but eventually we end up living with peace of mind ` somewhere south of you . ' ''
