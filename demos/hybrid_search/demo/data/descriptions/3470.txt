In this song Cook , who is the youngest of 11 half brothers and sister and says she comes from a `` crazy , somewhat dysfunctional family , '' tells the story of a very troubled girl who struggles with her addiction and the toll it takes on her family .
While Cook wo n't reveal personal details about the song , she talked about the songwriting process to Dan MacIntosh .
Said Cook : `` The writing of the song , and processing the emotion of the song , is two different compartments .
Process that emotion and the sentiment is difficult , but when I 'm writing the song , that 's not what I 'm doing .
I 'm writing the song .
I 'm sort of recognizing something that I 've already been through ; maybe I 'm going through it at the moment .
But the writing part is a different part of the process .
So the writing was not hard .
I probably wrote pretty manically about six pages of lyrics , front and back .
The most challenging part about making it into a song was probably the arranging and combing through what I had and making a song out of it .
It started to form as I was writing it , but then I had a lot more lyrics than I could put in a song , so that was the most work involved in doing it . ''
