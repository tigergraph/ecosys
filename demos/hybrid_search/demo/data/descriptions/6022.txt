Nail told Roughstock why he chose to cut this Brent Cobb , Adam Hood and Jason Saenz penned honky-tonk shuffle for The Sound of a Million Dreams .
`` I wanted a song that was right out of a honky-tonk .
` Grandpa 's Farm ' is funky and raw , and it comes from a live , intense place .
I think it sounds like a Black Crowes song , or like ` Honky Tonk Women ' by the Stones .
People say I have a soulful quality to my voice , and I wanted the rawness of ` Grandpa 's Farm ' to balance that out . ''
