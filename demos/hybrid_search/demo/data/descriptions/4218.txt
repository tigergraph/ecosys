Running to 9 minutes 33 seconds , `` Are You Receiving Me '' - sans questionmark - is the final , longest , and arguably finest track on the 1973 Moontan album .
The other four tracks , including the monster hit `` Radar Love '' , were co-written by lead guitarist George Kooymans and Barry Hay ; this one alone has a third songwriter credit , John Fenton .
Largely instrumental , this distinctly metaphysical track might well go down as the band 's masterpiece .
A few rock/contemporary songs are noted for fine saxophone solos , `` Baker Street '' and `` Will You ? ''
spring to mind ; although subdued , `` Are You Receiving Me '' also has some equally great sax intertwined with some great overdubbed Kooymans guitar .
