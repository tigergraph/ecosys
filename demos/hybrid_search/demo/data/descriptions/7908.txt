The third single from The House That Jack Built pays homage to the internationally renowned street artist Banksy , as well as being a lament to the reclusive painter 's loss of anonymity .
`` I 've been a fan of Banksy for ages , '' explained Hoop .
`` This song is a splatter of inspirations that I have gathered from his pieces round the world .
There are 4 or 5 specific pieces that inform the lyrics .
I named the song ` Ode To Banksy ' because , as a huge fan , I much prefer to keep the mystery of his identity alive ... and while I was writing the song there were big press blasts to reveal his identity ... which I ignored .
I 'll keep him masked thank you !
`` This song is like pop art itself ... for arts sake , '' she continued . ''
I am also a big a fan of Bobbie Gentry and her song ` Ode To Billie Joe ' is a long time favourite of mine ... the thought of the death of a great intrigue gave me a good excuse to write my own Ode . ''
