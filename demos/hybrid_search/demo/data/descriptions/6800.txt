The song is about loving someone in every aspect ; wanting to be that everything to his object of affection .
The song contains haunting but very sensual lyrics .
-LRB- thanks , Steph - San Antonio , TX -RRB- Michael wrote this song before his homosexuality was public knowledge .
The lyrics are ambiguous , and likely about a man .
The video , which starred model Tania Coleridge as the object of his affection , portrayed the song as being about a heterosexual relationship .
