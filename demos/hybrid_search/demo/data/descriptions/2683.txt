The Hunter is Mastodon 's second non-concept album , but there is a loose theme of space , which features on several tracks .
This song is about having the best sex you 've ever had - an organism so pleasurable that it takes you into outer space : `` It 's about -LSB- expletive -RSB- in space , '' said drummer Brann Dailor to Rolling Stone , `` Brent -LRB- Hinds , vocals/guitar -RRB- was like , ' -LSB- Expletive -RSB- all that !
Let 's just have fun . ''
Brann Dailor told Kerrang !
: `` This one is space-metal .
That 's where our heads were on this record .
The riff was born when Brent was jamming backstage when we toured with Alice in Chains .
I taped him playing on my phone , then played it back to him when we were writing the album . ''
The band added the fluctuating wails of a Theremin to the mix .
The most famous use of the bizarre electronic instrument was by The Beach Boys on `` Good Vibrations . ''
