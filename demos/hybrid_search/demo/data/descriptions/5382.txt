This is a track from British singer-songwriter Elvis Costello 's 2010 album , National Ransom .
During an interview with Spinner UK the comment was made that this has a 1950 's rockabilly feel to it .
He responded : `` When rock 'n' roll first kind of happened , it was because some people jammed together a couple of styles that nobody thought should work , like Elvis Presley had put together rhythm & blues and bluegrass , and he ends up with a rock 'n' roll version of ` Blue Moon of Kentucky ' ; or Ray Charles does secular lyrics and gospel music , and he gets soul .
So the strongest stuff has always been from people kind of mixing up the chemicals , and that 's all we 're still doing .
We 're not making any great claims to making an innovation here .
But ` Spell You Cast ' is a fun tune to play .
It has a double bass and drums , but it has a mandolin and an electric tenor guitar .
I thought it had a little bit of rock 'n' roll to it , it has a little bit of a kind of mod thing going on in there . ''
