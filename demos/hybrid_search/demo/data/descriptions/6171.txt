Lead singer Chino Moreno : `` The working title was New Murderer , the name itself is some Brazilian name that I read in a magazine and just liked .
It 's loosely based on the scenario of being taken captive .
It 's completely fictional .
I want people to listen to it and feel like they 're in the situation , because I do put myself in the story .
It 's up to the people to listen to it and figure out whether I 'm enjoying myself or not , even though it sounds a little eerie . ''
