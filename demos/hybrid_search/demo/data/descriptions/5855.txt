On this song the Backstreet Boys team up with American hip-hop & R&B singer-songwriter T-Pain , a collaboration which surprised some critics .
Brian Littrell told MTV News : `` Everybody has us trapped in a box .
Working with a guy like T-Pain , you have no choice but to get an R&B , hip-hop vibe , which is what we wanted to do .
It 's not just because T-Pain is T-Pain .
We 're fans as well , even though we 're entertainers .
We pulled in the Jim Jonsins , who did T.I. 's ` Whatever You Like ' and Soulja Boy , what we call that dirty South sound . ''
