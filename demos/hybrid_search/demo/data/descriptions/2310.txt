This song features vocals by Chaka Khan and guitar by Eric Clapton .
Bishop told us the story : `` Chaka was going out with and eventually married my friend Richard Holland ... I hung out with them back then .
She sang with me one night at the Troubadour and we used to see each other all the time .
He asked her for me and she sang on three songs on my first album Careless .
She sounded great and I told her to let wail on ` Save it ' which she did quite well , methinks.Eric and Pattie came by the studio where I was recording with Henry Lewy - it was the old A&M studio in studio C where Joni Mitchell always recorded .
It was through my manager at the time , Bob Ellis , who was married to Diana Ross .
He told Eric I was this funny guy and he got him to come out .
He brought his guitar and we found a little amp and he played the solo on ` Save It . '
We stayed friends through the years . ''
