This is a track from American Alternative Metal band Filter 's fifth album , The Trouble With Angels .
The song 's music video was directed by Mark Racco -LRB- Nirvana , Buckcherry , Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N ' Roses -RRB- .
He explained the clip to Noisecreep : `` Conceptually , ` No Love ' is about temptation and seduction .
The imagery is metaphoric .
The poker game , the dance , the beautiful women , the masquerade .
It 's more of a cautionary tale rather than a celebratory one , about the dangers of game playing , anger , lust and resentment and how they can lead to the dark side of eroticism and power , which can become a trap ; the temptations offered by the music business .
Sort of like a public service . ''
