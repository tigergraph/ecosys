This was Feeder 's breakthrough single , their first one to reach the UK Top 40 and to date their most successful release in the US .
Nicholas added in the same Kerrang !
interview : `` When I first wrote it , I drunkenly played it to my girlfriend on an acoustic .
She started crying because she liked it so much .
I thought that was probably a good sign .
It 's still one of my dad 's favorites too . ''
This featured in the 1998 teen comedy Ca n't Hardly Wait .
Frontman Grant Nicholas told Kerrang !
magazine June 21 , 2008 about this song about friendship : `` It 's a really simple song , there are only three chords in it but the lyrics - ` I 'm going out for a while so I can get high with my friends ' - seemed to connect with people .
I could probably write a similar melody again but not those words .
It 's a very youthful ; song . ''
This was not on the original release of Polythene , but it was included on the re-issued version , released later in 1997 .
The band originally were formed in 1992 in Wales by Grant Nicholas -LRB- vocals/guitar -RRB- and Jon Lee -LRB- drums -RRB- .
They changed their name from Reel to Feeder , naming themselves from an article in a fishing book after Nicholas saw the title `` Feeder '' and thought it would be a good name for the band .
After signing with Echo in 1995 they were joined by bassist Taka Hirose from Tokyo .
Lee committed suicide by hanging himself in January 2002 and this song was played at his funeral ceremony .
