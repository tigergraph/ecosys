Andrew Bird -LRB- from Drowned in Sound -RRB- : `` The operative word here is ` flail . '
Put away the china and just go berserk .
It helps with blood flow and confusing predators .
The song goes from catastrophic forces of nature : violent storms , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions to internal turmoil .
Night terrors brought on by ingestion of hallucinogenic aubergines .
Talks about language and how we must sew our own coats and not depend on old definitions : a theme readdressed in the song ` Nomenclature ' . ''
