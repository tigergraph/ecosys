English R&B singer-songwriter Estelle 's third album All Of Me is a far darker record than its predecessors .
The lyrics were influenced by a two bad experiences - being let down by some people close to her whom she trusted and an unpleasant ending of a three-year relationship with her boyfriend .
Regarding the latter she told The Independent : `` There were all these girls ... He tried to blame me by saying that , actually , it was me with all these guys , but it was n't .
It was the other way round .
`` This self-help homily written after the relationship ended was released as the second single from the set in the UK on December 4 , 2011 .
