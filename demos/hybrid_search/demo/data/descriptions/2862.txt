This bluesy slice of raunch gospel is the opening track of The Pistol Annies ' second album , Annie Up .
The record was produced by Frank Liddell , who is married to singer Lee Ann Womack .
Liddell also helmed the Annies ' debut set as well as all of Miranda Lambert 's solo albums .
Angaleena Presley described this ode to temptation to Billboard magazine as , `` Christian girls gone wild .
`` Ashley Monroe added : `` We wrote that a capella , just snapping -LSB- fingers -RSB- , we thought , ` should we make it big band , ' like Ray Charles , we wanted horns .
Frank 's like , ` horns ?
Really ? ' ''
