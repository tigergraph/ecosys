In the middle of the song , when you hear , `` Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist ? ''
, it 's a quote from `` Monster Mash , '' a 1962 hit by Bobby `` Boris '' Pickett and the Crypt-Kickers .
The sounds heard at the beginning of the song -LRB- water bubbling , chains dropping and dragging -RRB- are also taken from `` Monster Mash . ''

Showbiz , Oct. 16 , 1996 -RRB- : `` I 'd been stuck on Monster Mash and we were trying to use the Internet to get the words because I could n't remember them .
One of the guys on the production team is an Internet preacher .
So I said , ` Here 's your chance , go get these lyrics for me . '
Well , he went onto the Internet and found the lyrics - but they were wrong !
In all the jokes of that , our co-producer , Peter Collins , went out and bought the CD that had a compilation of some funny songs like that .
We got to listening to it , thinking about how funny it was and decided to put some samples of it in there .
That 's Igor going ` Goo mash goo . '
We had to get special permission and pay money and everything .
You think it 's so strange , when you just want to make a joke , and people want you to get permission and pay money . ''
-LRB- thanks , Matthew Daubert - Mequon , WI -RRB- Limbo was the first level of Hell in the book Dante 's Inferno .
