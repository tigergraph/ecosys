First season The Voice runner-up Dia Frampton wrote most of the lyrics for her solo debut album , Red .
This song started with an lyrical idea she had before it was fleshed out by Mike Busbee -LRB- Rascal Flatts ' `` Summer Nights '' -RRB- and Julie Frost -LRB- Black Eyed Peas ' `` Just Ca n't Get Enough '' -RRB- .
The song features a rapped interlude by Kid Cudi : `` It was a pleasure having Kid Cudi on this song , '' she told The Boot .
`` I 'm a fan of his work and also am very happy with the positive lyrics he created .
This song has a dark undertone , but overall , I wanted it to be optimistic . ''
Frampton explained to The Boot that the song title is a phrase that she and her sisters throw , `` around at home when we 're complaining about something when , on the other hand , it 's a beautiful day outside . ''
She continued : `` In other words , ` do n't kick the chair ' is another way of saying , ` do n't give up , ' because you ca n't have the highs without the lows , and there 's no use in getting down about something for too long .
You got to start pushing forward at some point . ''
