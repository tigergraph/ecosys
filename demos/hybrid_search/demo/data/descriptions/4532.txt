Natalia Kills had a turbulent childhood : when her Jamaican father was n't in jail , he was constantly moving from place to place with the singer 's Uruguayan mother .
This single deals with growing up in a destructive household .
`` I wanted a song that is the story of my whole life , '' Kills told Digital Spy .
`` From what I 've read , I 'm always seen as the bad girl ; the bitchy , sassy , cute bad girl .
I 've just assumed that everyone must know where it comes from .
To act like that , you ca n't just come from a good place .
I realized that not even people who know me most know what I 've gone through .
I always put on a brave face when I was the most terrified , the most trapped and out of control .
That 's what ` Saturday Night ' is like .
I wanted to make a confession of everything I am and all the stuff I 've been through . ''
`` I left home at 15 to escape all the bulls -- t , '' she added , `` but I ran head first into much more trouble .
I was taken away by the police for dangerous behaviour , being sedated , almost being committed and sectioned - it was trouble after trouble after trouble .
` Saturday Night ' is the way I can present that important part of myself . ''
