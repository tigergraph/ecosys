This was written by the songwriters Pat Alger -LRB- `` The Thunder Rolls '' -RRB- , Fred Koller -LRB- `` Angel Eyes '' -RRB- , and Gene Levine -LRB- `` Calloused Hands '' -RRB- .
Griffith is from Austin , Texas , so this song was a good fit for her .
In our interview with Pat Alger , he said , `` I was really trying to get the essence of what I thought Texas was all about .
I really did n't know anything about Texas .
I had never even been to Texas at the time .
I was just trying to get across what my impression of Texas was without having been there .
And I even called a friend of mine from Texas to make sure Corpus Christi was on the coast and all that stuff .
It turned out to have something which I really like in a song ; it 's kind of a sad song with a happy melody .
And she really responded to that .
And it ended up I actually played guitar on that record .
I played guitar on all of her records there for a while . ''
Pat Alger came up with the title to this song .
It was based on the Billy Joel song `` New York State Of Mind . ''
Said Alger , `` I always thought it 's not the New York State , it 's the Empire State .
I always thought that was a wrong -- it 's the only thing I did n't like about the song . ''
