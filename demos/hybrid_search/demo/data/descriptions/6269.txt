The song was directly inspired by John Steinbeck 's novel East of Eden , which parallels the Cain and Abel story in Genesis .
The title is a Hebrew word which translates as `` thou mayest '' and the discovery in the book by a group of Chinese scholars of Timshel 's proper meaning in connection with the Cain and Abel account is an important symbol in East Of Eden 's storyline .
Steinbeck points out this free will to make choices , which God has given mankind means that though we will not be able to overcome original sin , we may decide to ask for forgiveness for our sins .
Other songs that have been inspired by East Of Eden include Anna Nalick 's `` Drink Me '' Meg and Dia 's `` Monster . ''
and Bruce Springsteen 's `` Adam Raised a Cain . ''
Marcus Mumford said regarding the book 's author to Q magazine : `` Steinbeck is my favorite American author .
I 've even made a pilgrimage to his house in Salinas , California . ''
