The Boy Least Likely To told The Line Of Best Fit about this song : `` This was one of the last songs we recorded for the album .
We added it on at the last minute and then it ended up being the first single taken from it as well .
There are n't really any drums on it .
It 's all radiators and stamping on the floor , as well as some of our best clapping ever .
It 's a song about fighting , but then most of our songs are . ''
