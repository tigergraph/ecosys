This Country-ish song was brought to the table by bassist Robert DeLeo and cut at his home studio .
As with the other songs on Stone Temple Pilots , vocalist Scott Weiland penned the lyrics .
Guitarist Dean DeLeo told Musicradar.com : `` The interesting thing about our band is where Scott takes these tunes .
Robert presented the song , and out of nowhere Scott calls it First Kiss On Mars , even though the music is , like I said , kind of country .
I 'm very proud of the little solo - it 's sweet and melodic.This song has a very special meaning , however : Robert spent the last five years building a studio in his house , pretty much single-handedly .
We cut most of this song in his studio , so it 's really dear to him in that respect . ''
