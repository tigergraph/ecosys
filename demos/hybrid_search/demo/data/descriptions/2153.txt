Martha Wainwright has discovered a lot about herself from her father 's music .
`` The Hospital '' claims her mother nearly had an abortion while pregnant with her .
`` Five Years Old '' was written for her birthday party , which Loudon did n't attend .
At 14 years-old , she was in the audience when her father announced she was the subject of `` I 'd Rather Be Lonely .
`` With lyrics like `` I think I need some space/every day you 're in my face/I 'd rather be lonely , '' it was a shocking revelation .
But dad does have some regrets , which he expresses in `` Hitting You .
`` He paints a vivid image of Martha sitting in the backseat of the car in her bathing suit , her suntanned skin turning crimson after he smacks her leg with all his might .
`` I would never forget that event , that incident ... hauling off and whacking my kid , I mean , it 's not something I would ever forget .
There was an interesting song there , '' Wainwright told the A.V. Club.I said I was sorry and I tried to clean the slatebut with that blow I 'd sewn a seedand saw it was too lateThe seed grew into songs like `` Bloody Mother F -- king A -- hole , '' which Martha later wrote about her father .
