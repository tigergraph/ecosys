This is a track from Country music artist Blake Shelton 's second EP , Hillbilly Bone .
The song is Shelton 's own favorite on the album .
As he explained to Wendy Geller of Yahoo Music , it spotlights his personality : `` I really think over the past year , people have been identifying with my sense of humor .
This one is a fan favorite ! ''
Many Country radio stations wo n't play this song because of the ` a ' word in the title .
The Boot asked Shelton if he would ever consider changing the lyrics for a radio-friendly version of the song .
He replied : `` No , because if you change the lyrics to ` Kiss My Country Ass , ' you may as well not sing the song to begin with .
The whole idea of the song is that I 'm this guy , and if you do n't like it , get away from me .
Some radio guys have gotten this album early , and I 've been getting calls ... Everyone wants to be the person to say , ` I 'll play that , and none of these other wusses will . '
It 's the one song we thought would never get played , and it 's a big deal when they do play it .
It 's never going to be a big radio hit , but I do think it 's going to be a song that has impact on my career . ''
The track was co-written and previously released by Rhett Akins , reaching # 57 on the country chart .
Shelton explained to The Boot why he decided to cover this song : `` It may be one of my favorite songs I 've ever cut .
I call it my theme song .
Rhett Akins co-wrote it , and I 've seen him sing it so many times through the years .
I always told him , ` Man , if I ever get a chance , I 'm gon na cut that song . '
At this point in my career , with people knowing what they know of me , it 's the song they 'd expect to hear me song .
It 's already become a fan favorite from just doing it in my live shows . ''
