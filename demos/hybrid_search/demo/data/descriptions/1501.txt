This story about striving for equality is the first Vampire Weekend song that guitarist/keyboardist Rostam Batmangli sung on his own .
The track closes Vampire Weekend 's third album Modern Vampires of the City .
Batmangli explained to NME : '' Before , we 've always had a long song at the end of the record , but after ` Hudson , ' which is pretty dark , we thought it was good to have something with a little bit of hope . ''
