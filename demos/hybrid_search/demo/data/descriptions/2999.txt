This is the title track of American rock group Foreigner 's ninth studio album .
It was their first album containing fresh material for fifteen years and their first studio release with lead singer Kelly Hansen .
Ca n't Slow Down debuted on the Billboard Top 200 at # 29 , giving Foreigner its highest-charting album since 1988 , when Inside Information reached # 15 .
This song was written by the band as a tribute to NASCAR in celebration of Foreigner 's appearance at the Samsung 500 at the Texas Motor Speedway earlier in 2009 .
NASCAR fans bought so many CDs that day that Foreigner 's 2008 release No End In Sight : The Very Best Of Foreigner was propelled back into the Billboard Top 200 .
