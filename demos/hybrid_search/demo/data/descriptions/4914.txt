This is the second single from Pet Shop Boys eleventh album , Elysium .
Originally it was two different songs before the pair combined them together .
Singer Neil Tennant admitted to The Sun that he was initially concerned about the song 's morbid content , until his Pet Shop partner , Chris Lowe , reassured him .
`` I was worried about the lyrics being death until Chris pointed out the first line of ` West End Girls ' is ` sometimes you 're better off dead , ' '' he said .
`` It 's partly influenced by my parents both dying in the two or three years before this . ''
