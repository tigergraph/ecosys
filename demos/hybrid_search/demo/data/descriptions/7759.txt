McEntire explained to Great American Country : `` It 's about this woman who has a daughter that is almost déjà vu for this mother .
The little girl is leaving with evidently an older man on a date .
This is what happened to the mother 20 years ago .
She is n't going to let history repeat itself , so she follows them .
They are parked down by the river and she opens the door and takes care of the situation .
As the song says , ` You do n't want to see Mama go to war . '
Mama was protecting her daughter .
It 's one of those swampy Louisiana songs with that feel . ''
