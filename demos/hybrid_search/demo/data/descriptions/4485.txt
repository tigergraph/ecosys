David Hidalgo from Los Lobos is featured on this track playing the accordion .
In fact Hidalgo 's soulful squeezebox playing can be heard throughout Together Through Life .
Dylan got to know Hildago from when he and Los Lobos played some shows in Mexico a few years prior to the recording of the album .
In the same interview the interviewer commented that there is `` wonderful playing '' on this track .
Dylan was asked how he approaches the instrumental sections on a record citing the Joe Perry solos on Aerosmith songs as an example .
The singer-songwriter legend replied : `` What can I say , if I had Joe Perry with me everything would obviously be different .
As it is though , he was n't there .
Soloing is not a big part of my records anyway .
Nobody buys them to hear solos .
What I try to do is to make sure that the instrumental sections are dynamic and are extensions of the overall feeling of the song . ''
