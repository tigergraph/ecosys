Magnetic Man is an UK dubstep group comprising producers and DJs Skream , Benga and Artwork .
They signed to Columbia Records in February 2010 , and this is their first single on the label .
In an interview on the Virgin Media site , Artwork explained that it was Hunte who penned the song 's vocal hook .
He said : `` When we were writing the song with Angela , she 's an amazing songwriter and it was her that came up with the melody for ' I Need Air ' , she hummed it to us before sitting down and working on the words so we saw the whole thing come together before our very eyes .
Within the first ten minutes we were just like `` this is amazing , I want to hear it again '' and for the first few weeks having finished it , it was just stuck on repeat in my car , spinning round , and round , and round . ''
The song features Brooklyn-native singer/songwriter/producer Angela Hunte singing the hook .
Hunte is best known for co-writing the original version of Jay-Z 's smash hit , `` Empire State of Mind . ''
