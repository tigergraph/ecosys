`` Do n't Wan na Fall in Love '' is a song written , arranged , and performed by Jane Child .
The song was held back at # 2 by Sinead O'Connor 's floating head of doom singing `` Nothing Compares 2 U , '' which held # 1 .
This is her sole Top-40 hit , although she has a comprehensive music career including work as a record producer .
Child has since been on-again off-again in her solo career , preferring studio and session work .
In the UK , the song only made it to # 22 on the UK Singles chart ; this was because she refused to appear on the UK TV show Top of the Pops .
Reportedly , she considered that to be `` selling out . ''
The video shows Child stalking about in Manhattan ; she wanted it that way because she conceived the song there .
MTV was still showing videos at the time , and Child had a very interesting look that created some buzz : Cornrows and a chain that ran from her pierced ear to her pierced nose .
According to Child , the chain was inspired by Eastern culture .
She grew up in Toronto where there is a large Indian population .
Child also provided the song `` Mona Lisa Smiles '' to the soundtrack of the much underrated cyberpunk popcorn-muncher film Freejack .
