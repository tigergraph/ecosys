When we spoke with Howard Jones , he told us he decided to write this positive song for the audience he had garnered following the success of his debut album , Human 's Lib : `` We 're talking about the second album , now , and I 'd had great success with the first one .
I thought , People are listening to me , so what can I give them that is really going to help ?
And everyone goes through s -- t. Everyone goes through bad times .
Every single person on the planet goes through bad times .
And it 's great sometimes to have somebody say to you , ` Come on , even if it gets so you lose everything and everything goes horribly wrong , you can still pick yourself up and go forward , and you can make it right , you can make things get better . ' ''
Howard recorded a Simlish-language version of this song for the 2004 game The Sims 2 .
Howard Jones added he believes the song is still relevant nowadays : `` I 'm so glad that I can stick to those sentiments now .
And they 're just as relevant , really .
I think pop music , one of the things it should be is like a cheerleading song that helps you get through a bad time and pick you up a bit when you 're feeling a bit exhausted and glub .
And that 's what I really wanted to do . ''
The video , directed by Nigel Dick , was very popular on MTV , which in its early years favored British acts with outrageous haircuts .
The Charlie Chaplin character who shows up in the clip is Jed Hoile , a mime who was part of Jones ' stage act .
