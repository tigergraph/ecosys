Katie Armiger is a Country artist from Sugar Land , Texas .
Her journey began in 2005 when she won a Houston city-wide competition for young Country singers with her performance of Martina McBride 's `` Whatever You Say . ''
Two years later , her self-titled debut album was released on Cold River Records on August 21 , 2007 .
This song lived up to its title when it became Armiger 's first entry in the Top 50 of the Billboard Country charts .
This cut was written by Armiger , along with Bruce Wallace and Amanda Flynn .
The trio told The Boot the story of the song : Armiger : I wrote the song with Amanda and Bruce visiting Amanda 's mom in Kentucky .
We were listening to all of these horribly tragic songs on the drive there .
Surprisingly , all of the tragic songs had fairytale happy endings .
We started talking about how things never really turn out that way .
We wanted to write a parody for all those songs , so we wrote ` Best Song Ever . '
It took us about 20 minutes sitting on Amanda 's mom 's couch.Wallace : I had met Katie at a writers night through Amanda Flynn a few weeks earlier .
She invited me to come to Kentucky with her and Katie , promising I 'd get the single if I joined the retreat .
Of course , I had to take her up on it .
We watched Hoarders ' for 24 hours and finally thought of the idea ` Best Song Ever . '
It went pretty quick .
I 'm pretty sure none of us though it would do what it has , but I like to call it `` the little song that could .
`` Flynn : We started writing ` Best Song Ever ' after hearing a bunch of `` love gone right '' songs on the radio .
They were good , but we joked about writing the best song ever , and then we did .
