This song is about a man waking up next to a woman after a one night stand and telling her that he is going to murder her and steal her soul .
Alternately it could be about death closing in on an immoral person , and about her own destruction .
-LRB- thanks , Zack - Rohersville , MD -RRB- The title is not in the lyrics .
Stevie Wonder is blind , which alludes to the dark content of the song .
