Many people speculate that Mika wrote this song as a tribute to Queen 's Fat Bottomed Girls , '' but in promotional materials for Life In Cartoon Motion , he states that this is not the case at all : `` I was flying to Los Angeles the next day and I can never sleep because I hate flying so much .
So I was watching trashy television , it was two o'clock in the morning , a Victoria Wood documentary on Channel 4 .
It was about fat people in the United States and she visited a club called the The Butterfly Lounge , which was the first place of its kind , a club for larger women to hang out in .
Skinny women were not being allowed in .
The women were amazing and I absolutely felt as if I had to write about them .
I muted the television and wrote it straight away .
I never expected it on the album , but a few weeks later we recorded it and it 's now there .
So it is one of my favourite tracks and brilliant to play live .
Everyone sings along ! ''
Mika recorded a special version of this song for an episode of the TV show Ugly Betty , changing the chorus to `` Hey Betty , you are beautiful . ''
Mika explained to the Sun newspaper : `` Betty is a real fashion icon and we should celebrate anyone like her - genuine individuals who stay true to their own identity .
That 's what ` Big Girl ' is all about so it was the perfect fit to change the song for her .
It was a huge honor to be asked to do it .
I love the show . ''
In an interview on Australian Video Hits , Mika states that his mother is big , his aunties are quite big and as a kid , he was picked on , because he also used to be big , so he was touched by this documentary , and wrote the song in 15 minutes .
