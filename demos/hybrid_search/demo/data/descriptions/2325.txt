Guitarist/keyboardist Anand Wilder explained how this song was created to Complex magazine .
`` We were really trying to make a schizophrenic , contemporary dance song , '' he said .
`` We used a really cool sequencer called an Electribe to get the initial riff at the beginning of the song .
The riff was recorded live , using the sequencer as an instrument , sliding the pitch fader up and down .
`` Everything starts with the computer , '' continued Wilder .
`` We demo stuff at home , and bring it in and see what we want to make into a Yeasayer song .
And it 's always computer based .
But there 's always live stuff involved .
If you do n't have that , the music suffers in terms of dynamics .
It 's always good to have a human touch in there.There 's a lot of live performance on the record , but it 's generally cut up , and placed , and tweaked .
There 's something to be said for analog equipment , like a vintage guitar amp or something .
But we also want to be at the forefront of technology .
We like both . ''
The song was first played live by Yeasayer during their June 22 , 2012 concert at Cannery Ballroom , Nashville .
