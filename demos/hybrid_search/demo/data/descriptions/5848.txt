This song was born of the free time Aaron Dessner had to experiment with guitar sketches in his garage studio after the birth of his daughter .
He told NME : `` I almost did n't send this to Matt -LRB- Beringer , vocals -RRB- as it was something I did quickly - it 's simple , but he loves that kind of thing .
There 's something very heartfelt about it . ''
The song was released as the fifth single from Trouble Will Find Me .
It featured a bonus track `` Learning , '' which is a a cover of Perfume Genius ' 2010 tune .
Trouble Will Find Me is The National 's least cryptic album to date and this straightforward lament for the support of a partner is a case in point .
Beringer told NME that for once on this song he `` does n't hide behind some grand metaphor . ''
He added : `` It 's just a song about missing your wife , girlfriend , whoever . ''
The music video was directed by Brooklyn-based visual artist Sophia Peer whose previous work includes the clips for The National 's `` Graceless '' and `` Sea Of Love . ''
