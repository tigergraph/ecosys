Madonna closes the deluxe edition of MDNA with this electro ballad , in which she laments the loss of a friendship after things went wrong .
`` Your picture 's off the wall , but I 'm still waiting for your call '' she admits , before adding `` And every man that walks through the door / Will be compared to you . ''
Like several other MDNA tracks critics and fans have queried how much the lyrics allude to the ending of her marriage to Guy Ritchie .
