This is the first single from American singer Fantasia 's third album , Back to Me .
The song was penned by My Life Would Suck Without You writer Claude Kelly and released on May 11 , 2010 .
RCA/Jive Label Group senior VP of A&R Keith Naftaly told Billboard magazine that Kelly has an `` amazing way of decoding things in Fantasia 's head and turning them into incredible songs . ''
It was comedian , actor and radio personality Steve Harvey who came up with the album title after a radio interview with Fantasia .
`` Steve Harvey suggested the album title and it describes perfectly where I am in my life right now , '' stated the songstress .
`` I 've willingly let the world into my life through my book , the Lifetime television movie and now the VH1 reality show .
Now , it 's time to go back to how things used to be when America first laid their eyes on me on American Idol .
I want to focus everyone 's attention back to me and back to music that everyone can relate to and enjoy . ''
The music video was directed by Lenny Bass and features wide receiver for the Washington Redskins , Devin Thomas , as Fantasia 's love interest .
`` It 's all my concept , '' Fantasia told MTV News .
`` I was scared when I called the record label , because , of course , they had their own concepts .
And I was like , ` No , can I do it this way ? '
And -LSB- Lenny Bass -RSB- was totally open to all that stuff .
`` Fantasia also helped choose Devin Thomas as her co-star .
`` We actually sat on the computer for about three days just going through -LSB- potential -RSB- guys .
I wanted somebody tall , you know , a man .
Once I saw him , I knew I wanted to have him in the video , '' she said .
Kelly constructed the song , which finds Fantasia reminiscing about a past love , by tapping into the American Idol winner 's private life .
`` In the case of Fantasia , I put myself in the position of a woman who felt angry , hurt and vulnerable and longing for a man who she could no longer be in a relationship with , '' he explained to The Boombox .
`` That 's not something I 've ever dealt with ; really what it takes overall is fearlessness . ''
