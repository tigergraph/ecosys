This was written after the band 's life-changing USO tour of Kuwait and Iraq in August 2007 .
The group witnessed the war playing out in front of them as a casual conversation with medics was interrupted when the soldiers ran to save the lives of incoming wounded .
Frontman and lyricist Marc Roberge explained on the album 's promotional materials : `` It was the heaviest thing I have ever seen .
I could have written a ton of songs about the experience , but we thought putting just one on the record was perfect .
Soldiers say they listen to music to escape , not to be reminded of where they are .
` War Song ' is not about our view of the war ; it is about the warriors we met .
It follows someone who must leave home , go across the world , and be expected to return the same .
We thought the rest of the songs on the album should be escapes , not reminders . ''
