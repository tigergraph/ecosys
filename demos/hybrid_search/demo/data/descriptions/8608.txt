Pete Doherty wrote this song about his relationship with British model Kate Moss .
The song is about as romantic as Doherty gets , he 's saying that due to his volatile personality and addictions , he 's likely to mess up , but to give love a chance and he 'll try his best .
Confusingly , Doherty 's old girlfriend is named Katie Lewis , and he wrote a song about her with The Libertines called `` What Katie Did . ''
That is why Katie/Katy is spelled different in both songs .
