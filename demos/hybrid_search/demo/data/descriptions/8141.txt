This was the third single taken from British heavy metal band Judas Priest 's sixth album , British Steel .
This song was inspired by the unpopularity of the Conservative government in the UK at the beginning of the 1980s .
Frontman and lyricist Rob Halford explained to Billboard magazine : `` There was a feeling of the vast population of the British public being united against a government we felt was uncaring .
It was also a kind of kickback to the way we were being ignored by various elements of the press in our home country because the punk movement was dominating everything .
We wanted to send a rallying call out to the metalheads , not only in the UK but everywhere . ''
