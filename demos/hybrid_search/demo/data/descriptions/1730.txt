It took The Streets -LRB- Mike Skinner -RRB- much longer to complete the Everything is Borrowed album than expected , as he ended up discarding much of his original material .
He told Q magazine February 2008 : `` The songs started off as parables , but I realized that was cheesy .
I replaced them with more straight-up songs . ''
Skinner admitted to New Musical Express that the problems he encountered trying to complete the album were of his own doing .
He explained : `` It was quite well written and the rhyming was really good from a rap point of view but you were just left kind of empty so there was n't much to really stimulate people .
So I got rid of about 80 percent of the songs on the album and then started again .
I felt pretty disastrous really .
It was a year 's work up till that point , it was n't a very happy place . ''
