Orton penned this old-time waltz for her daughter , Nancy , who was born in mid-December 2006 .
It finds the singer looking forward to `` this beautiful life we 'll build by hand , from scraps and shards and broken strands . ''
We hear the mum singing of , `` the hours when spiders mend their webs . ''
Orton told The Observer that she came up with that particular line in the middle of a night , when Nancy had finally fell back to sleep and she was totally wide awake .
`` I looked on the back porch and there was this spider working away at its web , fixing it , '' Orton recalled .
`` I knew that I should go to bed myself , mend my own webs , but I found it was irresistible to go up to my room and pick up my guitar .
It was illicit .
And I knew I would pay for it the next day when Nancy would be up about five .
But I found that I could make connections that I maybe would n't normally make . ''
