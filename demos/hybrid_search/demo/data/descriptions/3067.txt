Cocker explained this ballad to The Independent May 9 , 2009 : `` When you first start a band as a teenager , you ca n't help but think of yourself as terribly deep and that you will , in some profound way , bring about a change in the world through your own creativity .
I certainly did .
But the more time has gone on , the more I 've realized that I 'm not deep at all .
I am , in fact , profoundly shallow .
Oh well . ''
A month before the release of Further Complications , the tabloids revealed that Cocker and his French fashion stylist wife , Camille Bidault Waddington , had split up .
Cocker admitted to The London Times May 16 , 2009 , that he was concerned about how Camille would view both this song and `` Leftovers . ''
He added wryly that this song 's title is `` the phrase that I would like carved on my tombstone . ''
