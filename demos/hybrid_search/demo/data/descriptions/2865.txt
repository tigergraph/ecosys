This song features Yeah Yeah Yeahs vocalist Karen O .
The band 's frontman Wayne Coyne told the Swiss music site Die Klangschau : `` For the Karen O tracks , I just called her up in her hotel room and we just did it right over the telephone .
It 's pretty absurd . ''
Coyne -LRB- from press notes -RRB- : `` Tribal conquering dirge .
Karen O kicks in singing with me and Steven -LRB- Drozd , multi-instrumentalist -RRB- .
A final revelation that celebrates the power of nature and implies that the only laws worth obeying are the laws one makes for oneself .
Experience is the only teacher . ''
