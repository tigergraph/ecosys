This is the third single from California rock band Train 's fifth album , Save Me San Francisco .
In the song 's lyrics vocalist and chief songwriter Pat Monahan sings of all of these great things he 's getting for his girl except , `` cologne , 'cause it 's poison . ''
Monahan explained to The Huffington Post : `` Have you ever been in an elevator with a lady who just got done perfuming ?
If you have , you wo n't wonder why I wrote it . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Fall Out Boy 's Pete Wentz .
He told MTV News about the clip : `` I talked to -LRB- Train frontman -RRB- Pat -LRB- Monahan -RRB- for a little bit , then wrote the treatment - I wanted to know where they 'd be willing to go and how involved they 'd want to be .
And after it comes out , I think people will see they were pretty involved .
It 's based off videos like -LSB- Michael Jackson 's -RSB- ` Leave Me Alone , ' or ` The Real Slim Shady ' ... it 's a bit of a parody , you 'll see Pat and the guys parodying themselves a bit .
That 's what I 've always found from -LSB- Fall Out Boy 's -RSB- videos .
If you take the piss out of yourself , people like it . ''
When the song ascended to # 1 on Adult Pop Songs chart , Train 's previous hit , `` Hey Soul Sister , '' was logging its 10th week on top of the Adult Contemporary chart .
This marked the first time that different songs by the same artist ranked at # 1 on Adult Pop and Adult Contemporary in the same week .
When Train appeared on The Howard Stern Show December 16 , 2010 , Monahan said that this song is about `` The fans that have been with us through all the weird times . ''
This reached # 1 on the Billboard Adult Pop Song chart , a survey which premiered in March 1996 .
It was the 100th record to reach pole position on this tally since its inception .
