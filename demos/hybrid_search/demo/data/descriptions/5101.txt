This modern day ballad was penned by Frank Ocean , but much to Conor 's disappointment , he never got to meet the American R&B singer-songwriter .
`` It was one of those sessions where a song is put out there , where someone writes it , and someone else hears it and I end up with a song on my album , '' he explained to MTV News .
`` For me , it 's kind of annoying I never got to meet him , but at the same time it 's an incredible song . ''
