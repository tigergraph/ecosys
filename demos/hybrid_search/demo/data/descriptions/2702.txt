This is the opening track from Welcome Reality , the debut album by UK dubstep act Nero .
The record was released worldwide on August 15 , 2011 .
Welcome Reality is a concept album set in 2808 in a post-apocalyptic , futuristic world .
This song introduces the storyline , which involves a recovery from a doomsday scenario and a love story .
Joe Ray from Nero explained to Digital Spy why they decided to record a concept record : `` We wanted to write an album that was n't just a collection of songs which include a couple of singles and a load of filler tracks .
We wanted to do something that was a whole piece of work .
So when one tune was started it kind of had a knock-on effect to the next one and eventually we found we had written this full soundtrack to a video that does n't exist ! ''
