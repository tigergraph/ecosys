The `` Wolf '' title and reference to Three Little Pigs has been seen as one of many fairy tale metaphors on the album , inspired by Yorke 's status as a new father .
Apparently , Yorke felt the lyrics were too bleak to use , until guitarist Jonny Greenwood came up with the jaunty , angular backing music .
