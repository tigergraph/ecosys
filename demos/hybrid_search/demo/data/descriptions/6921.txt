Joanna Newsom was born in Nevada City , a small town in Northern California .
She explained to Mojo magazine April 2010 that her birthplace was the inspiration for this song .
Said Newsom : `` That one is a little bit about the strange , sad inner fission that arises from a wonky and vacillating homing instinct , like two warring magnetic fields operating on the same compass .
It 's kind of a love song to Northern California , of course , and the place where I was born .
I was thinking about what makes a place hard to leave , and what makes a place impossible to remain in . ''
