This is the title track of Atlanta based R&B singer Ciara 's fourth solo album , Basic Instinct .
The song sees Ciara abandoning the pop sound of her previous records and returning to her R&B / urban roots and the sound of her debut album , Goodies .
Ciara explained in a interview with Maximo TV : `` When you get the record , you 're gon na get a really fun vibe .
You 're gon na get an even more sensual side and also confident and cocky .
I got like such an attitude on this record , but in such a fun way . ''
The song finds Ciara lashing out at bloggers and critics .
She told Jonathan Landrum Jr of The Associated Press why she wanted to express her frustration at her detractors : `` I wanted to speak to all the haters .
I just wanted to scream out and show how I felt .
People are so easy to write you off .
I live for energy like that .
The harder they hate , the harder I go .
I do believe I will be here for a while .
I 'm claiming it and no one ... make me think differently . ''
The album title was inspired by the 1992 Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone erotic movie , Basic Instinct and in particular Stone 's seductive and sly crime writer character .
The song 's music video was directed by Phil the God and features a cameo from the album 's co-executive producer , The-Dream .
