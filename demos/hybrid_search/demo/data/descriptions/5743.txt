Prior to the release of Lucky , Nada Surf lead singer Matthew Caws made this statement : `` I tend to be pretty hopeful about things further in the future , but full of anxiety about the next 8 hours .
Unlike my friend John Flansburgh from They Might Be Giants , who says he 's manic depressive without the depression , I think I 'm manic depressive without the mania .
Yet I 'm ready to be cheerful at the drop of a reason .
I 'm always looking for rapture in music . ''
