The sound for this unusual short instrumental was created by Tool lead singer Maynard James Keenan 's Cat .
The sound is actually Maynard 's cat being squeezed and the resulting sound slowed down to create the low pitched noise .
-LRB- thanks , Craig - Blairgowrie , Scotland -RRB- `` Mantra '' is about 1:10 long , and maybe 25 seconds are featured in the `` Schism '' video .
The Mantra is the subtle hum of the soul and spirit it brings all communication of the body to one .
-LRB- thanks , Dan - Stourbridge , England -RRB-
