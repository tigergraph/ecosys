This was released as the first single from American alternative rock band Angels & Airwaves ' fourth album Love : Part Two .
The song was premiered following the release of the band 's Love feature film on August 10 , 2011 , which includes music from the record .
The Mark Eaton and Will Eubank directed high-tech video was filmed at the state-of-the-art Sky Church venue at Seattle 's Experience Music Project Museum , which boasts the world 's largest indoor video screen .
The song finds frontman Tom Delonge singing about being `` a passenger , '' referencing a well-known description of our planet - `` We 're all just passengers on planet earth . ''
He explained the song 's meaning to Spinner : `` They call it ` the quickening , ' as you get older and as the world speeds up .
It seems like the earth rotates much faster and days go by and you realize that you 've been stuck in a specific job or a specific situation and you 've missed out a lot of your life .
You start to get a lot of anxiety , because you want to do something different .
You think you 're capable of so much more but just along for the ride .
And that 's really what the song 's about . ''
