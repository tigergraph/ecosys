This is the first single by the American singer Lenny Kravitz , from his ninth studio album , titled Black and White America .
The long player had a previous working title of `` Negrophilia . ''
The single was used in a NBA promotion with Turner Broadcasting .
Kravitz , who lives in Miami and is a Heat fan , told Billboard magazine : `` I was n't thinking about any sort of affiliation or anything , but they heard the song and said , ` This is perfect for our season and we 'd like to use it . '
I 'm always careful with those kinds of things , but when I got the footage back it was so dynamic and it worked really well with the music . ''
