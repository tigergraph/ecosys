Field Music are an Indie Rock band hailing from Sunderland in the North East of England who formed in 2004 .
The band 's core consists of former Futureheads drummer Peter Brewis and his brother David .
This song is their first single from their third album , Field Music -LRB- Measure -RRB- .
David Brewis explained to CMU how he and his brother go about creating a track .
`` Peter and I generally do n't write together .
For me , a song usually starts from a little riff or melodic idea and I try to let that idea ferment in my brain and imply what else should happen in the song .
It 's not always quite that easy though .
Lyrics usually come in a similar way - one or two little nuggets which grow into a song , through some combination of sorcery and sweat .
For this album , we started recording most of the songs with one of us playing the drums and the other one playing a guide guitar or piano .
It 's not like we jut pile stuff on top after that though - we both tend to have a very clear idea of the arrangement from very early on the songwriting process .
The difficulty then is trying to make our recording match the sound of the song we have in our heads . ''
This song was written by Peter Brewis .
His brother David told Drowned in Sound about it : `` Lyrically , this one owes our lot to our dad - if either of us are getting down at ourselves for screwing something up , he 'll say , quite sensibly that the only people who make no mistakes are the ones who do n't do anything , or in finest mackem-speak , ` Them that dee nowt , mak nee mistakes ' .
The music shows our love of Lyndsey Buckingham and Fleetwood Mac - Peter wanted a song where the rhythm came from a really clipped acoustic guitar and the drums and bass embellish around that . ''
