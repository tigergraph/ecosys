This is the third single from Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace 's seventh studio album , Burn Burn .
The record was recorded at lead singer Raine Maida 's home studio in Los Angeles between 2007 and 2009 .
Here 's another Norman Rockwell music connection : Somebody 's Watching Me singer Rockwell , -LRB- real name Kennedy Gordy -RRB- , was given his recording name by the Motown brain trust after someone saw a photo of a Rockwell painting .
The song 's music video is a compilation of footage taken from the first leg of Our Lady Peace 's Clumsy and Spiritual Machines revival tour .
This song was inspired by the art of American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell -LRB- 1894-1978 -RRB- , who is best known for the cover illustrations of everyday life scenarios he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine over more than four decades .
Maida explained : `` Norman Rockwell paintings , while being weaved into ` Americana ' over the years have always seemed creepy to me .
The irony is that ` Dreamland ' is inspired by his style of painting .
Escapism from present day woes right into one of his Rockwell lands .
I guess part two to ` Dreamland ' would have us sinking into the dogs playing poker painting . ''
The Burn Burn album title is based on a quote by Jack Kerouac from his 1957 novel On the Road .
