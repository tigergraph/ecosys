This song was partly inspired by the French actress Maria Schneider , who died from cancer on February 3 , 2011 aged 58 .
She was best known for playing Jeanne , opposite Marlon Brando , in the 1972 film Last Tango In Paris .
Smith told Uncut magazine that Schneider , `` was a friend of mine in the '70s , '' and that this song , along with her tribute to the late Amy Winehouse , `` This Is The Girl , '' `` just happened , like gifts . ''
Smith told Spin magazine : `` I did know Maria in the '70s , but ` Maria ' is not just about Maria .
I would say it is the more emotional song on the record ; it 's the one that looks back on a beautiful time and sort of encapsulates the '70s in a certain way for me .
It 's a nice little R&B song , but an emotional song . ''
