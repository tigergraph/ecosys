A Galaxie is a kind of car - a big piece of Detroit iron made by the Ford Motor Company .
Lead singer Shannon Hoon owned a 1964 Ford Galaxie , which inspired the lyrics - he sings about the feeling of freedom and solace the car brought him .
Brad Smith says that this song is `` about just finding that place that makes you comfortable. , '' adding : `` For Shannon it was a Galaxie car .
But it 's finding that place and that space in the world , after everything that Blind Melon had been through for everybody in the band , including Shannon , but it 's finding that space where you 're away from the stage and the road and the other band members .
And you 're finding a space in the world that just makes you feel at home . ''
Blind Melon bass player Brad Smith wrote the original version of this song , which was called `` I 'm A Freak . ''
When he brought it to the band Shannon Hoon completely rewrote the lyrics .
In our interview with Smith , he explained : `` I think Shannon was inspired by my original lyric and went off on his own tangent and eventually just replaced all my lyrics , which is totally fine .
Because his lyrics were better than the ones I had .
Mine were kind of halfway worked out .
Shannon kicked it across the finish line , which was awesome . ''
