This plaintive , vocal-driven send-off is one of two songs on Veckatimest to feature choral arrangements by classical composer Nico Muhly .
They were sung by the teenage Brooklyn Girls Choir .
Singer/co-songwriter/guitarist Daniel Rossen commented to Drowned in Sound : `` One of my favorites on the record , and one of my favorite songs of Ed 's of all time .
When I first heard him do it with just piano it was so gorgeous and we fought to keep it as simple as possible so as not to overcomplicate it , since it was already so nice as it was . ''
