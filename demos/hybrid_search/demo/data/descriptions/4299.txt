Country music artist Ronnie Dunn 's second solo single following the disbanding of the Brooks & Dunn duo is a working man 's job application during difficult economic times .
`` Three dollars and change at the pump , '' he sings , `` the cost of livin 's high and going up . ''
Dunn told the story of the song in an interview with Country Music Is Love : `` Phillip Coleman had written almost the entire song , all the verses and stuff .
It did n't have a title .
It did n't have a hook line -LSB- or -RSB- a chorus .
I asked when I first heard it if I could have a shot at it , -LSB- saying -RSB- , ` Could you just give me two days ?
I wo n't hold it up or anything . '
`` After Dunn came up with the lines , `` two dollars and change at the pump , cost of living 's high and going up , '' the song quickly finished itself .
Dunn 's record label had some concerns that the Country star was not in a position to sing the song .
He told Country Music Is Love .
`` I had another executive come to me and say ` Hey , you 're too wealthy to record it , you ca n't say all this ' .
`` Well , I grew up in trailer houses in New Mexico , Arkansas , Texas and Oklahoma .
Do n't pull that one on me , man , '' he replied .
`` We can all relate to it .
I even look today at the cost to run a bus , it 's insane . ''
The song was originally penned by songwriter Phillip Coleman before Dunn rewrote the chorus and hook back in 2008 .
Back in 2008 , the US was reeling from financial losses all across the country , however some of the label chiefs were confident things would improve .
`` I had one of the record guys saying , ` The economy will be turned around by the time you can get this song out , ' '' Dunn revealed to Country Music Is Love .
Because of the head honcho 's optimism , the singer had to go back into the studio to make the lyrics say `` three dollars and change at the pump , '' instead of two dollars .
Dunn originally cut this with a full band but the final version on the record is sparser .
The singer told American Songwriter magazine that after the originally recording , he tried to work on his vocals but could n't get his head round it .
`` So I stripped it back to a bass , drums , and an organ , '' Dunn explained .
`` I let the organ and the volume , I followed that for the dynamics and found a place for it .
I remember the engineer standing right here .
I remember him jumping up at the end saying , ` Got it !
Got it !
I ca n't believe you hooked a song like that ! '
I said , ' I know , I know . '
I 've never taken one on like that before .
He was just jumping off the floor .
But I learned that that sparseness can really be your friend . ''
