This is the first official single to be released by Welsh singer-songwriter , Marina and the Diamonds , from her second studio album , Electra Heart .
Marina described the song in a track-by track on Amazon as , `` channeling the archetype of The Star , asking for adoration . ''
The single was released on April 16 , 2012 .
Electra Heart is a concept album centred on the titular character , who is a combination of Hollywood pin-up and Greek tragedy .
Marina told The Sun that Electra Heart has four personalities , one of which is ` The Primadonna ' -LRB- a beauty queen -RRB- , whom she sings of in this song .
They are , she said , `` magnifications of certain parts of me and of every woman . ''
Electra Heart was originally intended to be a side project .
Marina wanted to release the material under an alias , but was warned off the idea by her management team .
`` I called my manager in April 2011 and said , ` Hello .
Can I pretend to be a totally different person ? '
He said , ` No .
You can not ' , '' she tweeted .
`` I calmly put the phone down and screamed til eternity . ''
The phrase `` prima donna '' is used to describe someone , usually famous , with high expectations of others who becomes angry when his or her standards or demands are not met .
Opera companies originally used the term to designate their leading female singer to whom the prime roles would be given .
Because of their pulling power at the box office , some of these Prima Donnas exhibited an inflated view of themselves and could be difficult to work with .
However because of their talent , their excesses were indulged .
The song was produced by famed pop hitmaker Dr. Luke , who is responsible for hits by such A-list stars as Katy Perry , Rihanna and Britney Spears .
Marina admitted to The Sun : `` I was so scared of going into the studio with Dr Luke .
He 's so chilled but I was terrified .
I thought I was going to puke with nerves .
But I did it and now I can go into a room with anyone . ''
