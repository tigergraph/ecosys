John Vesely , who is Secondhand Serenade , told MTV about this song : '' ' A Twist In My Story ' is one of my favorite songs on the album .
First off , the production is great .
I always wanted to have an orchestral-based song , and I think it came together really well .
I did n't really know what to do with it when we started recording .
There were ideas of throwing in a full band , but I really had my heart set on keeping it simple and intimate .
It needed to be acoustic-based , so I recorded the acoustic guitar track , and we sat down to start throwing ideas out .
We ended up giving stings a try , and instead of keeping them in the background , we put them right up front.This song is also very important to me because I wrote it about the day I found out I was going to be a father .
It starts off with the phone call telling me the news and continues with the emotions and feelings running through my head .
I wanted to make this song extremely personal and literal .
I wanted to make it feel like the listener was there finding out with me . ''
