Davide Rossi , who is the violinist , guitar and keytar-player for Goldfrapp , arranged this song .
He was discovered when Coldplay toured with Goldfrapp .
Drummer Will Champion told Q magazine July 2008 : `` Dav is like a one-man orchestra , he plays an electric violin that has everything , from the top note of a violin to the bottom note of a cello , all that range on one thing . ''
Lead singer Chris Martin added : `` We 've become very good at collaboration .
And passing if off as our own work . ''
Drummer Will Champion told MTV News why Chris Martin sings in a lower register on this number : `` One of the main things we tried to focus on with this record is changing vocal identities , because Chris has a very recognizable voice .
Just the idea that you can totally change the sound of a song and the sound of a band , just by treating the vocals a different way .
So in a song like ` Yes , ' Chris is singing in a lot lower register . ''
This song features a North African string-and-tablas arrangement around the lowest singing register of Chris Martin 's recorded life so far .
Drummer Will Champion told Billboard magazine that he credited producer Brian Eno with upending Coldplay 's usual working habits in the studio .
He said : `` Brian has this amazing ability to demystify wonderful music and make it seem very achievable .
We were n't afraid to try anything . ''
