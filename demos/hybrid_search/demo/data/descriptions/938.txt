The longest song on This Is Happening at over nine minutes , this is a riposte to anyone expecting LCD leader James Murphy to come up with a radio friendly , three minute pop song .
`` So you wanted a hit , well maybe we do n't do hits , '' he sings .
`` I 've tried and I 've tried .
It ends up feeling kind of wrong . ''
Murphy is best known for his dance punk cuts , but he did once pen an unreleased song for a certain pop artist called Britney Spears , whom you may have heard of .
This was co-written by Hot Chip and sometimes LCD guitarist , Al Doyle .
Murphy told the story behind this song to The NME May 18 , 2010 : `` That came about because I was surfing with a guy 's who 's in a much more successful rock ensemble .
He asked , ` Are you gon na make a radio hit on this record ?
I wanted to be like , ` You think I 'm not trying ? '
I suddenly thought , ` Well , why do n't I make hits ? '
I kind of like that we do n't make hits , -LRB- but0 it 'd be fun to have one .
This probably wo n't be because it 's eight minutes long . ''
