Grand Central Station is a train terminal in New York City , and a bustling hub of activity .
It 's a majestic building where amid the din , travelers can find moments of reflection , as so many journeys started or ended there .
Mary Chapin Carpenter wrote the song after hearing an interview with an iron worker who was one of the first on the scene after the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center .
The interview aired on a New York City radio station on the first anniversary of the attacks , and it brought Chapin Carpenter to tears .
`` Those first few days there at ground zero , he felt it was a very holy place , '' she told NPR .
`` When his shifts were over , he felt this lifeforce was somehow asking for his help , and when he would leave his shift he figured , whoever wants to go , I 'll take him with me , and he 'd find himself just going to Grand Central Station , standing on the platform , and figuring whoever wanted to go home could just catch the train home . ''
Chapin Carpenter immediately started writing the song , and had it finished three days later .
