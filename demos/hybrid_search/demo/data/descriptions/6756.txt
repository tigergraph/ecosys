Frontman Cormac Neeson -LRB- from Kerrang !
February 21 , 2009 -RRB- : `` The lyrics came into my head back when -LRB- then British Prime Minister -RRB- Tony Blair and his boys were talking about introducing these ID cards they 've been talking about for a while .
And I remember just thinking what the f -- k is this all about , they might as well attach tracking devices on to everybody so they know exactly where everybody 's going at every moment of the day . ''
The Answer were the opening act for AC/DC 's Black Ice World Tour in Europe and the Australian legends were evidently in Neeson 's mind when he commented : `` The riff is probably one of the strongest riffs on the album and any AC/DC comparisons are welcome ! ''
