Guitarist Synyster Gates wrote this song after the band 's drummer Jimmy `` The Rev '' Sullivan was found dead on December 28 , 2009 .
It is Syn 's way of saying goodbye to his friend and is the first Avenged Sevenfold song to be written both lyrically and instrumentally by him .
Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater filled in on drums for the Nightmare album and subsequent tour .
Like The Rev , Portnoy has struggled with addiction .
He told us : `` When I see what happened to The Rev , or Paul Gray from Slipknot , I feel horrible , because I understand the disease and how dangerous it is , and if you 're an addict or an alcoholic , like I am , the writing 's on the wall .
You ca n't live that kind of lifestyle and live a long , happy life .
You know , that lifestyle and that disease , which I have , is going to take you out .
You have two choices when you 're that deep : you either have to get sober , or inevitably end up in hospitals , institutions , death , or jail .
There 's only two roads when you 're that bad of an alcoholic or an addict .
And I saw the writing on the wall for myself ten years ago .
I have a son and a daughter who were just born back then , in the late '90s , and I saw that my alcoholism was killing me , physically , emotionally , and mentally .
And I saw what it did to some of my heroes , people like Keith Moon and John Bonham , and it scared the hell out of me .
I had to make a decision .
I wanted to live .
I wanted to be a father and a husband and be alive for my family , friends , and my band .
And that 's when I decided to get help and get sober . ''
The song features on acoustic guitar Syn 's stand up comedian father , Brian Haner Sr. , who is commonly known as Jeff Dunham 's `` Guitar Guy . ''
Vocalist M. Shadows said in a video interview the song is `` very stripped down , raw and very personal '' as it 's supposed to feel like `` one guy with one guitar , sitting there and speaking to his best friend . ''
