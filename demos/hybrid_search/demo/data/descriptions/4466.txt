This catchy folk song was released as their debut single in Iceland in September 2011 and went to the top of the charts in their native country .
The following April the tune became their first entry on the US singles chart , when it entered the Billboard Hot 100 at # 92 .
Speaking with Interview Magazine , Hilmarsdóttir explained the song 's meaning : `` How we usually make our lyrics is , Raggi and I , sometimes we come up with stories or situations .
That one is about a relationship .
Sometimes we have n't wanted to give too much away .
We like people to read their own things in the lyrics .
I guess I could share it .
It 's about a couple and the husband passed away and it 's from the conversation between the two of them .
We do n't know if she 's going crazy or if someone 's actually there .
We 've kind of been inspired by people that lived in my house .
This old couple that lived there for 30 years .
The woman passed away , so it was kind of different . ''
