Kelly debuted this tongue-in-cheek romp about getting married at the CMA Music Festival in Nashville on June 8 , 2013 .
It was her first time playing a Country music festival .
`` I 've been nervous all day because I wanted to be good for you ! ''
she told the crowd .
The video for the marriage-themed song features Clarkson playing a wedding singer at a barnyard reception , along with scenes of couples on their special day sent in by fans from their own nuptials .
The lyrics are peppered with mentions of setting dates and cutting cakes before Clarkson demands in the chorus : `` Every wall needs a frame .
Every ball needs a chain .
I 'm talkin ' about tying the knot .
Tie It Up . ''
The lyrics were presumably inspired by her fianc√© , Brandon Blackstock , who proposed in December 2012 .
