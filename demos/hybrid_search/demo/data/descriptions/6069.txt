Vocalist Yannis Philippakis explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` It 's to do with being ` me . '
Being carnal , being base , '' he said .
`` There 's a lot of self-delusion that goes along with being a human being where you believe that you are above your instinctual presets and you 're above your genetics .
You 're evolved microbes and that 's what we are .
It 's meant to be carnal , lustful and wrong and penitent at the same time . ''
