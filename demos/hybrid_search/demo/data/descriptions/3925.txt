Happily married , Darryl Worley wrote this song about his wife , Kimberly .
With all the warm , fuzzy feelings that love brings , the song ended up just schmaltzy and romantic enough to melt female hearts throughout the world.Writing it was an interesting experience , however , and not one Darryl had ever tried before .
In our interview with Darryl Worley , he told us : `` I was sitting in my living room just downstairs in our home at the farm , '' Worley says , describing the songwriting session .
`` Our little farmhouse down in west Tennessee , I have a cow farm down there .
One of my producers -LRB- Jim Brown -RRB- was down and we were co-writing , and it was funny , because I was writing a song about my wife and she was in the kitchen .
It 's just all one big room downstairs .
And she was right there making us something to eat for lunch , and we were writing this song about her , and she 'd come over , lean over our shoulder every now and then and go , ` Hmmm , I like that . '
I 've never really done that before with the person that you 're writing about walking around in the same room .
That 's a little bit odd , I guess .
But it worked out okay . ''
Darryl and the former Kimberly Perkins were married on December 2 , 2007 , and had their first baby , Savannah Gail , on March 24 , 2008 .
Working its way up the charts , according to Darryl this song was doing nicely , `` and the female audience was definitely more into it than probably anything I 've ever released . ''
Then suddenly , inexplicably , it started a nosedive and quickly fell off the charts completely .
But that 's something that happens in the world of music .
`` It 's one of those things , '' Darryl philosophizes .
`` That 's the way the business is .
They do n't all go to the top . ''
This song was the third single release on the Sounds Like Life album , and it peaked at # 43 on the Country charts .
