Frontman Mark Hall said on his record label 's website that a slow fade marks the regression that happens when Christians are n't living intentionally .
He explained : `` People do n't crumble in a day .
You do n't fall , you fade .
In your mind , there 's that pride that says ` I 'd never do that ' ... but you do n't just do it , it 's a slow , series of compromises , little ones that go there eventually , until you 're sitting in a place you 'd never go , doing something you 'd ' never do ... and yet the way you 're living totally makes sense to you somehow because you 're so numb . ''
The scriptural footing for this song and the rest of the The Altar and The Door album can be traced back to Psalm 1 , which reads : `` Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers .
But his delight is in the law of the Lord , and on this law he meditates day and night ... . ''
Hall explained : `` The whole album funnels from this passage .
Imagine the man in this verse totally breaking down , but just a little at a time .
First he 's walking , then standing , and eventually sitting , just slowly shutting down .
He does n't crash suddenly-there 's no sudden crash in the Christian life .
The ` crash ' is just the fruit of a slow fade . ''
