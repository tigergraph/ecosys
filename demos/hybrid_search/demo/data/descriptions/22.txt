Death Cab For Cutie 's frontman and principal songwriter Ben Gibbard married actress and musician Zooey Deschanel in September 2009 at a ceremony near Seattle .
Unsurprisingly fans wanted to know how much of Codes and Keys was written about his new wife .
In an interview with Jam !
Music prior to the release of the album , Gibbard responded to that very question .
He said : `` There are moments on the new album - like ` Stay Young , Go Dancing ' or the first verse of ` Monday Morning ' - that are about my wife .
I love Double Fantasy .
I love Ram .
I love marriage records .
And I 'm very aware that given the fact that I 'm married to a person who is very well known , the assumption is going to be I 'm referring to Zooey .
Sometimes I am , and sometimes I 'm not .
That 's just something people need to deal with in their own way .
`` The couple announced their separation in November , 2011 after two years of marriage .
