This cut was influenced by vocalist Justin Pierre 's experience of being with his grandmother a few hours before she passed away .
He explained to Spin magazine : `` My grandmother died late in 2009 and it was the strangest thing .
I was trying to go back to film school when we had this big break , this big opportunity .
But I wanted to see her because I knew she had cancer and was on her way out .
Something told me I just had to go see her .
I had to put my life and band on hold and say , ` Screw it ! '
and go hang out with her .
I flew down to L.A. the next day and hung out with her.It was a weird experience being with this shell of a woman that I used to know , '' he continued .
`` She could n't move or communicate .
I did n't know what to do .
I hung out with her for a few hours and she died the next morning .
If I had n't gone , I would have never experienced that .
And that experience might have been what set me towards this idea of just existing and living in the moment , and that definitely plays into the record .
` Happy Anniversary , ' this sad new song , is based on that experience .
It 's from the point of view of the someone who is dying .
It 's one of the songs that I 'm very excited about . ''
