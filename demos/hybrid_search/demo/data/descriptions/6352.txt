Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson said of this song in an interview with New Musical Express : `` It 's about a search for empathy .
We can forget so easily that people are the same regardless of their sexuality , religion , color or moral values .
Regardless of the differences between people -- their color , creed , sexuality or how they behave and express themselves -- essentially we are exactly the same .
It 's about how when you are dealing with other people you have to remember that they are all carrying with them their own baggage . ''
In our 2013 interview with Butch Vig , he said : `` I came up with that song idea in about five minutes and just started playing it on acoustic guitar .
When I showed it to the band , we recorded it really quickly . ''
Shirley Manson name checks the author JT LeRoy in the lyrics .
LeRoy , and her many writing personas , has inspired Manson 's lyrics several times , notably in the band 's 2001 single `` Cherry Lips . ''
In a 1998 with NME , Shirley Manson interprets bleeding as a metaphor for self-expression : `` I think good bleeding , really great bleeding is hard ... To be great at bleeding , you have to be Thom Yorke , who 's great at bleeding , a genius at bleeding .
Bob Dylan is a genius at bleeding , where you touch the essence of something .
And that 's really difficult to achieve . ''
In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Garbage drummer Butch Vig explained that the song was inspired by the movie Thirteen .
Like the movie , the song is about individuals who need others to notice their pain , whether in the form of actual self injury -LRB- scars , cutting -RRB- or other types of harmful behavior .
It addresses many forms of behavior including actual cutting , anorexia , alcohol abuse and gender role confusion .
