The song title refers to Mraz 's grandfather , Frank Mraz , who moved from Austria-Hungary to the United States in 1915 , where he earned a living by his hands .
Mraz snr had a sign over his workshop that said ` Frank D. Fixer , which was used as a geographical location in his hometown of Mechanicsville , Virginia .
Jason Mraz told Billboard magazine regarding his grandpa : `` People would say , ` Well I live two miles past Frank D. Fixer ' or ` Take a left at Frank D. Fixer ' and he fixed farm equipment and appliances , and grew his own food or would fix farm equipment in exchange for food from that farmer .
And I feel we 're back in an age celebrating the do it yourself-er , where reduce , reuse , recycle , repair , repurpose , all those things are as important now as ever and it takes the skills to fix things that will keep us from over consuming to a point where our desires overshadows our needs .
I wanted to tribute a man like Frank D. Fixer .
By doing so I get to take on his qualities , his strengths become my own . ''
