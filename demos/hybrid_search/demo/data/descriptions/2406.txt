This song links to one of the concepts of Days Go By , which is that people feel like they 've had enough of these current difficult times .
Frontman Dexter Holland told to Spinner : `` You can almost sense something in the air , whether it be the Occupy movements or the elections .
People are about ready to turn the tables .
It 's an observation and a warning .
Something 's got to give or something 's really going to give . ''
