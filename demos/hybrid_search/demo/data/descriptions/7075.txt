This song was written about the Tour De France , a famous French road race for professional cyclists .
Kraftwerk members Florian Schneider and Ralf Hutter are obsessed with bicycles , calling themselves the Radsportegruppe Schneider -LRB- Schneider Cycling Club -RRB- .
The track was originally recorded with the intention of being included on Kraftwerk 's Techno Pop album .
However the project was never completed and the song was released as a single .
The following year after being included on the soundtrack to the film Breakdance , the track was re-released this time reaching # 23 in the UK .
Ex-Kraftwerk member Karl Bartos claimed Florian Schneider and Ralf Hutter 's obsession with cycling was one of the factors that prompted him to quit the band .
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England , for all above -RRB- The melody appears to be borrowed from part of the opening section of German composer Paul Hindemith 's 1936 `` Sonata For Flute And Piano . ''
In Britain this was used by Channel 4 as their theme music for their coverage of Tour De France .
The sleeve of the `` Tour de France '' single was adapted from a 1953 Hungarian postage stamp .
