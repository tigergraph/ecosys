Allan penned this heart-rending ballad with Rachel Proctor and John Lancaster .
He told Billboard magazine : `` It sounded like old country - like '80s style , which I love .
It was fun to write it , and fun not to give it away until the hook of the song .
`` Allan added that the song is ripe with honesty - like the ones he grew up with .
`` To me , that 's what country music is , '' he said .
`` The stuff I was blown away by as a kid , they just blasted you with truth , like the Highwaymen . ''
This was one of four tracks on Set You Free that Allan produced along with engineer Greg Droman -LRB- Brooks & Dunn -RRB- .
`` Getting in and doing it myself with some of my band guys was a big deal , '' he observed .
`` It was a big breath of fresh air . ''
