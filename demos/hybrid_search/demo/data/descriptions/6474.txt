Brown told Clash Magazine about this song : `` It 's about where I come from , where I 've got to .
Yeah it 's my favourite subject , myself -LRB- laughs -RRB- .
I did the last one , as a sort of social commentary on the state of the world , so I did the opposite ; the last album was sort of a social commentary about the churches , poverty and I thought I 'd rather do it in an album than talk about it in interviews , instead of going on about them in interviews , I 'll put them in a song and so I did it that way .
I had to bring it back round the opposite way and this is all about the person not the whole world . ''
