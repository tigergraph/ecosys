Like the other 5 new songs on the Exile on Mainstream album , `` These Hard Times '' was written by all 4 members of the band .
This was a fundamental alteration from their previous albums when frontman Rob Thomas had operated as Matchbox Twenty 's songwriter and musical catalyst .
Guitarist Paul Doucette told the Fairfax County Times how this was a refreshing change of approach : `` We all feel like we listen to the 6 new songs that are on ` Exile ' and we 're like ` Yeah , I totally hear me .
Whereas in the past , you 're fighting so hard to get your ideas across .
You 're maybe fighting too hard because you just want to get your ideas heard , and it 's not necessarily what 's best for the song or what 's best for the band .
It 's just about ego .
And I think that we 've kind of lost that .
Our egos , we finally learned to check them at the door . ''
