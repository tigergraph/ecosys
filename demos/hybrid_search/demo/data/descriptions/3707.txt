This is the third single from Country music artist Bucky Covington 's sophomore album , I 'm Alright .
The Liz Hengber , Thom Sheperd and Steve Williams penned song tells the story of a father who shows his children how much he loves them by taking care of all the little things in life .
Covington said : `` We were basically done with the new CD when this song came across the desk ... the minute I heard it I knew that I had to cut it .
It reminds me of my dad when I was growing up and I think many people will relate to it too ! ''
Covington told The Boot : `` I think anybody over the age of five can relate to it .
It 's saying how you bought your first home , and your dad came over and took his flashlight and went all over the house fixing this , fixing that , but never said he liked the place .
And the gist of the song is pretty much he 's saying I love you the only way he knows how .
It 's just a magnificent song - I absolutely loved it .
`` The singer added that because he grew up with two fathers , a dad and a stepfather , he was able to relate the song to both of them .
`` It was a no-brainer for me .
On that song , we did some things different , too .
Every time I go into a studio I try to push it as high as you can , and this song is completely different .
Not only did we not push it , we dropped it .
I 'm singing it with a completely different key of my voice than I usually do .
I liked it , it was something different , it pushes you . ''
