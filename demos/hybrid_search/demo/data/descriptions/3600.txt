This song is about a guy who is a devoted friend of a girl that he is in love with .
However he has n't told her how he feels for fear of destroying their close -LRB- but not at all sexual -RRB- friendship .
The chorus -LRB- and title -RRB- is a plea to the girl to surrender herself so they can be together because he cares deeply about her and he ca n't stand only being her friend anymore .
-LRB- thanks , steve - ontario , Canada -RRB- In the video , lead singer Ben Kowalewicz falls over at the end .
In the uncut version , he is shot in the head , with blood spatter .
They cut this scene after deciding it was too graphic .
-LRB- thanks , Spencer - Edmonton , Canada -RRB-
