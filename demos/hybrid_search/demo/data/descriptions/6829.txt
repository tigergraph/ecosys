This is a track from Disc-Overy , the debut album from Tinie Tempah .
The London rapper said : `` On every single song you 'll get a line that reveals what life was like for me .
I recorded a lot of it after ` Pass Out ' went to # 1 , so that gave me a chance to reflect on life before and after achieving success .
Going to number one gave me a chance to consider how far I 've come , but also how far I intend to go . ''
A remixed version of this song featuring American drummer Travis Barker , was released as a digital single in the UK on April 20th 2011 .
It was n't originally intended to be a single , but appeared due to public demand after the remixed version featured in a Lucozade advertising campaign .
Tempah was born in Brixton , London and lived in a tower block with his parents until they could afford to move to a semi-detached house in Plumstead .
On this track he raps `` High rises can block your horizons . ''
Tempah recalled to The Sun September 24 , 2010 : `` It was the worst , huge tower block .
I hate tower blocks .
I feel like they were designed for failure .
They 're designed for people to move into and never ever leave.But one day , when I was 12 , I looked out and saw a big house in the distance .
I knew I wanted a different life , to escape.When we moved to Plumstead , we thought our semi was a palace .
We had white neighbours who brought us a cake .
It was like Malcolm in the Middle > and we had a pond .
We knew we had made it when we had a pond ! ''
