This is Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Mesbitt 's debut single .
Some fans queried if it was about splitting up with Ed Sheeran , but she explained to The Daily Record October 14 , 2012 that she penned it about a previous relationship .
`` I wrote ` Boy ' about 18 months ago .
It is about a relationship where you break up with someone and want to move on but they do n't , '' she said .
`` I decided to write a song about it .
I was still at school at the time , '' Nesbitt continued .
`` In June , I decided to go into the studio and experiment a bit with it .
I 'm a big fan of rock music like Nirvana and AC/DC , and I like pop and acoustic music , so I wanted to take all three influences .
There are a lot of singer-songwriters that are similar to me , so this gave me the chance to do something a bit different .
`` My ex probably knows the song is about him .
He did know he was going out with a songwriter . ''
