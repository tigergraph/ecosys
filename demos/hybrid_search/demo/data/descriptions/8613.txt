Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucci penned the lyrics to this song about a count that scared him during a visit to Tuscany .
Four out of the six songs on Black Clouds & Silver Linings are over 10 minutes long .
This one at 19 minutes and 16 seconds is the longest .
When we asked Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy about this , he replied : `` We always have a couple of songs that deal with heavy topics , but not necessarily an entire album .
This particular album , because there was only 6 songs , because the lengths were very long , it meant that there were only going to be 6 subject matters .
Normally if we have more songs on the album , we 're able to cover more lyrical ground .
But with only six songs , inevitably the topics are heavy . ''
