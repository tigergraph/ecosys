This song is about drug addiction and other things that will harm you in life , seen from the perspective of the drug , the man taking it , and a man who is giving advice because he has already experienced it.Man effected by drug : `` If there was a single day I could live , a single breath I could take , I 'd trade all the others away . ''
- He is saying that he has been permanently scarred by the drug and wishes he could have one day were he was normal again.The drug : `` I 'll make all your dreams come to life And slay them as quickly as they came . ''
- Saying that once you have used the drug it will be amazing but afterwards the effects will be horrible and damage your brain.Man giving advice : `` Lay this to rest console yourself you 're better alone destroy yourself .
See who gives a f -- k. '' - He is saying that you 're much better off without the drug and even if you do take it no one will care that you died .
