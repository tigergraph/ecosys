This is the only track on Enjoy Yourself , for which Currington has a co-writing credit .
He explained to The Boot : `` I really wanted to record an album full of my favorite songwriters in town and bypass anything that I 've written this time .
But it came to that one slot where I was trying to find that really laid-back song , and the only thing that came to mind was one that I had written about seven years ago with Scotty Emerick and John Scott Sherrill , which is the ` Bad Day of Fishin '' song .
So , I just grabbed it and recorded it and put it on there , and that 's the only reason I made it on there as a songwriter . ''
Currington loves to go fishing .
He said : `` It 's one of my favorite things to do , definitely , during some downtime .
Like the song says , the hook of it is ' a bad day of fishin ' beats a good day of anything else . '
That 's me , no doubt .
It does n't matter .
Just being out there on the water is good for me . ''
