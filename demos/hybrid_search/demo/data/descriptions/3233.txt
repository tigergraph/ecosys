Haim recorded this tune with frequent Arctic Monkeys producer James Ford , who also is one half of the Electro-Dance duo Simian Mobile Disco .
Este Haim told NME that the song was a surprise : `` We 'd been working with James for a week and we were restless , so we thought , ` F -- k this , let 's do something from scratch . '
James tapped out a drumbeat and we f -- ing wrote a song in a day .
It was just supposed to be a release exercise to calm us down . ''
NME asked Este Haim if the song 's lyric about `` Lyin ' Eyes '' was an Eagles reference ?
She replied : `` We said when we were writing it that people would think we were jocking the Eagles .
We love the Eagles .
One of our favorite concerts we ever went to was theirs in San Diego - we could see Tijuana from the venue . ''
The song is about ending relationships .
Este Haim told NME : `` You think back to the decision that you made to not be with someone any more and whether it was really the right one .
It 's kinda a weird thing , especially in my case .
I 'm 27 now and I 'm not old but I think the relationships that you have you think about longevity .
So when you do break up with someone there 's always a thing in your head of , What if that was the one and you said goodbye ? '' ''
-LSB- Writing this song -RSB- I was thinking , F -- k am I gon na go my whole life being like that ?
, '' she continued .
`` And what would I do if I did make a mistake ?
I just , I was at a point when I was thinking ... it was a weird time .
Having relationships now is ... it 's a whole different ballgame , I 'm just kinda navigating that , what it means having a relationship , not having a relationship , that weird ` We 're in a relationship but we 're not in a relationship ' ... '' `` Love is probably the thing that people adhere to and identify with , '' Este concluded .
`` Heartbreak and love are the two things that I personally like writing songs about most .
At my core I 'm fu -- ing human . ''
