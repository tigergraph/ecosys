This melodramatic soul-drenched waltz-time piano ballad finds Bowie singing a kiss off to a would-be suicide , whose depression appears to have been brought on by the loneliness of a city .
`` I can see you as a corpse , hanging from a beam ... Oh , see if I care , Oh please make it soon , '' he croons .
Critics have compared the tune 's mournful tone to that of `` Five Years '' and the song concludes with the drum pattern of the Ziggy Stardust track .
The song title is taken from a lyric from Elvis Presley 's first hit , `` Heartbreak Hotel '' .
Bowie shares his birthday , January 8th , with The King .
