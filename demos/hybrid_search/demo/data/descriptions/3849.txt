The band were formed after singer Jarvis Anderson , keyboardist Sam Martin , and guitarist Simon Katz met at the University of Colorado .
When they moved to California they recruited drummer Luis Rosiles and bass player Michael Bucher .
The band released their debut UK single `` Violent & Young '' on the Indie label Another Music = Another Kitchen before signing to Mercury Records after a brief bidding war .
This feel good summer anthem was their debut major label release .
This song , along with the rest of the album , was recorded with Mark Needham , who has previously worked with The Killers and My Chemical Romance .
Anderson gave an alternative explanation of the band 's name to Billboard magazine : `` I used to help a mentally disabled kid in high school get to his classes and he called me igloo so I just used that but with the letter `` u. '' Sam called himself Hartly Dark while in college for some odd reason and we came together as Iglu & Hartly .
This was the beginning of a totally awesome adventure . ''
Jarvis Anderson explained the song to The Yorkshire Evening Post : `` It 's about moving to LA , going through different things ... our parents were like ` great ! '
It 's controlling your surroundings , once you 've attained that confidence it 's a euphoric moment .
The hook came right out of my mouth , really naturally .
It 's an inspirational song , and I hope people listen to it and find that honesty for dominating whatever they want in their life . ''
None of the quintet are called Iglu or Hartly .
Anderson explained to The Yorkshire Evening Post the band 's name .
`` Iglu & Hartly was the name of a ship .
We took a history class in college .
The ship sailed to Hawaii to get pineapples , but got cinnamon instead .
It was cheaper and easier to store or something .
So it 's a metaphor : you go searching for something but maybe get something better instead .
We did n't set out to be in Iglu & Hartly , y' know ? ''
