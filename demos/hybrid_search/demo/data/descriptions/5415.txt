In an interview with Musicomh.com , lead singer Christian Lindskog said : `` For me , the meaning behind -LSB- the lyric -RSB- ` Ai n't it something to know you 're lost ' is basically how I felt after I went home from South Africa and saw how things are in Sweden .
I just felt lost and appreciated what that really feels like .
I was looking , questioning , and searching for God in all of it , not being totally depressed about it , but searching .
I felt like I was on a big black sea but there was still that hope , like ' I wonder what 's gon na be around the corner . '
I felt like I was waiting for God to be ready to speak to me , but in reality it was probably me not being ready to listen ! ''
