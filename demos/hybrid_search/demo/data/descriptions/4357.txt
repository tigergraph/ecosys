The band consists of four real-life best friends : Kendall Schmidt , James Maslow , Carlos Pena Jr. and Logan Henderson .
This Kevin Rudolf produced song was released as the group 's fifth single .
James Maslow told Artist Direct about this song : `` That was one of the tracks from earlier in the season last year .
It 's not brand new , but we still perform it all the time .
We originally wrote the song for the show .
We wanted to create this idea where we shoot a music video in the show , and all these directors have terrible ideas about how to make the city theirs .
It was our way of saying , ` Hey , we just moved to Los Angeles .
Let 's show everybody we can have a good time , and this is what we love to do . '
We relate the song to everywhere we go .
When we tour around the country , it 's going to mean , We 're partying .
This city is ours .
Let 's rock out and have a good time .
Everybody believe you 're meant to be here . ''
