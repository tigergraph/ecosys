The eight-minute closer of alternative rock band The Horrors ' third album was originally going to be a 30-second piece of music until synth player Tom Cowan had a vision for extending it .
Unfortunately , he fell sick at the wrong time .
He recalled to NME : `` I remember being taken ill when the first part of this one was being written .
I had my head buried in the sofa while I could hear this beautiful song taking form and just thinking , F -- k , this is just up my street , why today of all days ?
I just wanted to be sick and go to bed , but all the time I was fighting it because I wanted to join in the fun . ''
