Otto told `` Radio For Humans '' about this track : `` This song is kind of a real groovy , R&B - feeling song .
Like if Ray Charles was doing a modern Country record , it would have that R&B - feel to it , that kind of groove to it .
It seems to be appealing to more women than men , which is not a bad thing .
Actually the key demographic in Country music is women and all men want to reach women , that 's why we play music and buy nice cars and buy nice things , because we want to meet women in the first place .
So , I guess it 's just a groovy song , it 's got a unique feel and kind of a sexy thing and hopefully it reaches them on all those levels . ''
This was the best selling hit of 2008 on the Hot Country Songs chart .
When this topped the Hot Country Songs chart dated for May 17 , 2008 , Otto became the first artist to score his initial # 1 Country hit since Emerson Drive reached the summit for the first time with `` Moments '' 11 months previously .
He was also the first to do so on an independent label -LRB- Raybaw -RRB- since Garth Brooks debuted at # 1 in September 2007 with `` More Than A Memory '' -LRB- on the Pearl label -RRB- .
Otto wrote this with Jim Femino and D. Vincent Williams .
He told AOL how the song came together : `` We sat down to write and I said , ' I have got this hook - just got started loving you . '
D. Vincent had this melody line , which turned out to be completely hooky .
The feel of that melody and that hook just sounds sexy , but I had no idea it was going to do what it did . ''
