According to keyboardist Adam Anderson , this is `` the most effortless song '' that Hurts have ever recorded , `` and it sounds that way . ''
He explained : `` When we started as a band a few years ago we 'd always try so hard to make songs have an impact and I think one thing that we 've learnt -- and it 's exemplified in ` The Crow ' -- is that we do n't always have to try that hard .
It 's this graceful song that does n't smack you in the face . ''
