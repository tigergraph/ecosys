Frontman Ryan Clark explained why we only hear half of this song 's hook the first time through and we have to wait for the second chorus section to hear the full hook .
He told Alternative Press : `` I think this just happened naturally with the way the song was structured -LRB- before I started to write the vocals -RRB- , but I really dig that detail .
It 's something that I 've noticed Scar Symmetry do on occasion , and I 'm always stoked to hear what seems like an additional chorus . ''
Clark told Alternative Press that the opening riff , `` is a great representation of the guitar tone we were aiming for on this record . ''
He explained : `` We wanted something that was distorted and had a lot of attack , but had a certain amount of clarity and roundness to it as well .
There 's definitely a fine line between too distorted/dirty and too clean .
I 'm really proud of all the tones we achieved on this record . ''
