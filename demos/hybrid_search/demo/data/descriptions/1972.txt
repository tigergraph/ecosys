The song was written for actor Heath Ledger 's daughter , Matilda .
In an interview with the Melbourne Herald Sun , Harper said : `` Heath Ledger called me up and said ` Ben , I 'm having a baby , and you need to write a lullaby for baby girl . '
I obliged and out came Happy Everafter In Your Eyes .
`` Ledger was found dead in his apartment on January 22 , 2008 .
