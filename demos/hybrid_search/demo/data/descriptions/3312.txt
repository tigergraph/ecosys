Toby Keith spoke to AOL Music about this song , which was written by Chris Wallin and Keith 's frequent songwriting partner Craig Wiseman : `` Very few times do I record a song I do n't write .
I can probably count on both hands the number of times I 've done that in my whole career .
This song was n't written for me , but it sounds like I wrote it for myself .
Every word Craig wrote tells it like it is for me .
There are a lot of homeless people out there who are lazy , drunk or hooked on drugs , but there are some who might just be down on their luck .
So I may feel like the homeless should just get up and go to work , but I wo n't stop giving money to charitable organizations that help people on the street .
I do sometimes think war is necessary , but if we could push the big red peace button and make it all end I think every single one of us would . ''
This was Toby Keith 's first Country # 1 on his own Show Dog Nashville label .
His previous 15 chart-toppers had all been on major labels .
One of the reasons Keith recorded this song was to try to explain himself after all the criticism he received for his patriotic post-9 / 11 number `` Courtesy Of The Red , White And Blue -LRB- The Angry American -RRB- . ''
