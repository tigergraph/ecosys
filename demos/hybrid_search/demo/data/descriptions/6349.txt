This epic track was born out of something Slash started doing during his guitar solo on the live shows .
He told MusicRadar.com : `` It turned into an entire song and there 's an extended outro solo and an extended fingerpicking intro .
It 's probably the most guitar-focused song on the record . ''
Speaking with the Irish Times , Slash responded to suggestions that the song 's intro sounds like it was inspired by Bach 's `` Toccata and Fugue in D Minor . ''
`` In this really interesting day and age of social networking , it started with just one person who said it was a Bach thing , '' he said .
I had no idea it sounded like a Bach thing , and then everybody asked me about it .
I think it is just the style of the arpeggio .
Still , there are worse musicians to be compared to than Bach .
`` I 'm proud of the song , '' he continued , `` I always liked it .
It was one of the songs that came up at the tail-end of the recording when we were in pre-production . ''
