`` Baby Just Break '' is a track from his first album , and one where he encourages listeners to challenge themselves and break the rules .
`` That song was inspired by living , '' he told us .
`` I was living in Vermont before I moved out here -LRB- Los Angeles -RRB- .
It 's about repetition and getting into a routine that 's just not productive .
I was in that mode , and then I just decided I had to throw everything out the window and jump into the void .
So that 's what that song is about , just breaking that f -- king wall . ''
