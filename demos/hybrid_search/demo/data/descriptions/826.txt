Frontman Derek Sanders explained this song 's title to Artist Direct : `` A year or two ago , I always thought it would be awesome to name a song `` If You Ca n't Live Without Me , Why Are n't You Dead Yet ? ''
When we were writing the songs for this record , that one had the perfect feeling for the title .
A Lesson in Romantics had songs with longer , kind of interesting and clever titles , and that fits with it . ''
