This was one of three Delta Machine tracks that Dave Gahan penned with Kurt Uenala .
Gahan met Umela when he worked with him on his vocals for The Depeche Mode singer 's 2007 second solo album , Hourglass .
The song finds Dave Gahan offering to rescue the protagonist from their predicament .
`` You were falling , '' he croons , `` I will catch you , you do n't have to fall that far '' .
He told The Sun : `` The lyrics of ` Broken ' are probably based on a friend who 's been struggling for a while with his own demons .
I see myself in him , and you ca n't make somebody change . ''
