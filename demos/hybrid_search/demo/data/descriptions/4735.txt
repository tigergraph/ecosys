In an interview for the Fascination Records website Cheryl Cole of Girls Aloud commented on the use of the vocoder on this track : '' ` NNN ' was a great track and it let people know we 're back .
A lot of people seem to be using that vocoder now , like Kanye and Shayne Ward .
So we 're proud to be doing that first ! ''
This was the group 's 16th consecutive UK Top 10 hit , earning the girls a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the most successful female group in UK chart history .
The promo for this song , which was directed by Trudy Bellinger -LRB- Rachel Stevens , Sophie Ellis-Bextor , Bodyrockers -RRB- , won the online Virgin Media 2007 Music Award for Best Video .
Tangled Up also won the Virgin Media Award for Best Album of 2007 .
The guitar riff is sampled from Scottish rock band Nazareth 's 1975 track `` Hair Of The Dog . ''
The meaning of the phrase ` hair of the dog ' is the ancient notion that the imbibing of alcohol can cure a hangover .
This is based on the concept of what ails you is more of what ails you .
In the video for this song , the girls had to don catsuits .
Girl Aloud Nicola Roberts told the Metro newspaper November 12 , 2007 they did n't enjoy wearing them : `` The catsuits were awful to put on .
We had to put lubricant all over our bodies and it felt like we were swimming around in the suit , it was disgusting .
It worked on the video though . ''
