Haile Selassie was Ethiopia 's Emperor between 1930 and 1974 , when he was deposed by a military coup .
The Rastafari movement considers him to be the Biblical messiah , the incarnation of God who will lead followers into a new golden age , hence his importance to Jamaican reggae musicians such as Bob Marley .
Though Bright Eyes ' Conor Oberst does n't necessarily believe in the tenets of Rastafarianism , he admires the values within the reggae community .
Said Oberst to American songwriter magazine : `` Lyrically , I 've always liked reggae music , but liked the lyrical themes which are kind of redemption , and liberation , and overcoming oppressive evil .
In their case they 're singing about imperial powers , the oppression of the poor people , and those ideas .
The way I 'm thinking about them it 's more about humanity as a whole .
I do really believe that there are evil people in the world and there are good people , and often times the evil people run the show .
I find a lot of the imagery in reggae music can be so potent and powerful , so I guess in a sense I co-opted some of those ideas , maybe took it out of context .
But I still think it 's applicable to a wider message .
It 's basically like people that believe in peace and love and equality of all humans , seeing one another in each other . ''
The tempo is noticeably different from most of Bright Eyes ' offerings .
The song marks a growth in the band 's musical context and ability to connect its music to different international genres .
