Zac Hanson told us : `` It 's a song about the fact that fairy tales are n't necessarily true , that people 's dreams do n't always flourish .
Loved ones die , people who deserve so much do n't get what they should , and you should still believe in fairy tales because of the beauty of it , and you should still get up and strive to be a better person , live a better life and do these things ; not to fall into the norm , but strive to do something great with your life .
It 's kind of cheesy , but I think it 's a story that everyone should put to their life and go for a little more . ''
