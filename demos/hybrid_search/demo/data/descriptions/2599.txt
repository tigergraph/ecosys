Guitarist Anthony Armstrong : `` There are times regardless of how hard we fight it that we just feel like we 've drifted so far away from what we used to be ... it 's frustrating because sometimes we do n't really remember where it all went wrong and how we get back to that place and go a different direction .
This subject matter felt like it needed to be wrapped in a ballad .
The slower tempo and feeling felt right , but we juiced it up with heavier guitars than a typical striped down ballad .
The bridge is where it seems to turn around and we discover a way to get back to where we want to be . ''
