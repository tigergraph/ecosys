Tears , Lies & Alibis was an important project for Shelby Lynne .
It was her eleventh studio album and the first to be released through her own record label , Everso Records .
Finally wielding entire creative control , Lynne was very purposeful about which songs she included on the album.One song , `` Like a Fool , '' almost did n't make the cut , but it turned out to be her favorite from the collection .
She explained in an interview with Blogcritics : `` I wrote that song so quickly and so fast after a day of writing a whole other song .
And then I thought I was finished and ` Like A Fool ' just kind of fell out on me .
Such a simple lyric and I saw it on the paper and I thought , Oh , how sweet .
That 's a sweet little thing but I doubt it will ever make the record .
And that 's my favorite .
I just love the simplicity of it . ''
