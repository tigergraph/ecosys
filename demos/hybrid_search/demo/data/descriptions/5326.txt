Cheryl Cole appears to use the lyrics of this acoustic pop song to deliver a message to her former husband Ashley Cole , following claims that the England footballer cheated on her with a string of women during their three-year marriage .
During the song she sings , `` I cried when I heard you were cheating , I cried when I said I was leaving , I cried when my heart stopped believing ... I cried when I slashed all your tyres , I cried when your suit hit the fire , I cried cos I knew I 'd never see you again ... but those were happy tears .
`` Cheryl Cole did not write the lyrics , but is said to have approved them after they were penned .
