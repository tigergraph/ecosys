Vanessa Carlton told American Songwriter magazine the lyrics for this song `` came in one fell swoop . ''
She added : `` There 's a line in the chorus that goes ` Do n't you worry you 'll soon be on the mend .
That 's no trick , that flicker of radiance . '
Which is a response to Black Rook in Rainy Weather by -LRB- American poet -RRB- Sylvia Plath . ''
Carlton says that the song was inspired by an essay written by her cousin , and is for a friend who was contemplating a divorce .
