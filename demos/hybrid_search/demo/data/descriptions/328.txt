This is the first single from Canadian rock band Three Days Grace 's third studio album , Life Starts Now .
The song had its North American radio premiere on Ottowa radio station CKQB-FM on August 31 , 2009 .
In an interview with Jam !
Music , Gontier discussed how he and the rest of the band have experienced a series of personal tragedies , illnesses and challenges throughout their career .
`` All of us have dealt with diseases in our family and people getting cancer and people passing away , '' said the frontman .
`` A couple of us are going through that right now .
We know everybody has problems and battles in life , but it seems like ever since we signed a record deal and hit the road , we 've been dealing with those things .
`` If there is any upside to these crises , it 's that they 've given the band plenty of inspiration .
`` You get in the studio , and it 's a chance to write and get out a lot of feelings and emotions , '' Gontier explained .
`` And we had a lot to work with this time .
We were all feeling pretty emotional and going through our own things .
All that stuff - the personal issues and the family issues - it all comes out on this record .
`` However the record is not all or doom or gloom .
This track , for instance , is about rejecting negative influences .
`` I felt like I wanted it to be a bit more hopeful , '' Gontier said .
`` The songs still came from a pretty dark place of confronting things .
But I think there 's definitely hope on this record .
For us , it just comes down to playing the hand that you 've been dealt .
That 's kind of what Life Starts Now is all about , really - dealing with reality . ''
The song was written by the band 's main songwriter Adam Gontier and produced by Howard Benson , who had worked with Three Days Grace on their previous releases .
