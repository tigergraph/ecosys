We did the movie This Christmas and working -LSB- on the set -RSB- , he said , ' I got this record that if you get on , I think it will be great . '
I told him I did n't want to do a typical R&B record - I do n't wan na do the hook-kinda thing that every other R&B artist does .
I would more like to be in tune with the verse or do a verse almost like I 'm rapping , but singing it .
I recorded the song in -LSB- Virginia -RSB- , he said , ` Oh word , that 's dope . ' ''
