The Amps were a band from Dayton , Ohio .
They were formed by Kim Deal in 1995 after her group the Breeders went on hiatus , after Deal 's sister and bandmate Kelley was arrested for heroin possession .
With Kelley in rehab , in St Paul , Minnesota , Kim announced plans for a solo project before conceptualizing it as a group and recruiting Jim MacPherson , the drummer from the Breeders , and Luis Lerma and Nate Farley , two friends from Dayton .
Pacer was released in late October 1995 but did not sell very well .
In the USA , it reached # 29 on the Heatseekers Albums chart .
This is the title track of the only album released by the group .
Kim told Mojo magazine June 2013 : `` Pacer was mostly a love letter to Kelley .
I was feeling love , anger , worry , resentment , and gratitude that nothing worse happened . ''
