`` Chartreuse '' came out of an attempt by ZZ Top to play a Gillian Welch composition , `` It 's Too Easy . ''
The band were forced to adapt the song as it proved to be complex to play , eventually revamping it into this tune .
Guitarist Billy Gibbons told Music Radar about his guitar solo .
`` For the solo , I discovered that we had written a section in two different keys , '' he said , `` and I do n't know how to play a solo that jumps from key to key without weeks of practice in order to get it polite .
So , in short order , I knocked it out .
It 's pretty well seamless .
The bonus was playing the '61 Les Paul that I got from George Gruhn .
What an excellent-sounding machine . ''
According to an interview with Music Radar , when asked what the title should be , chief engineer Gary Moon said : `` Call it Chartreuse .
First off , it 's a liqueur , and secondly , it 's an oddball color , and that 's what you guys are ! ''
