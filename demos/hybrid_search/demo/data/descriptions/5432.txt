Beth Orton closes her fifth album , Sugaring Season , with this offer of solace and comfort .
The album title serves as a metaphor for the ten songs on the set .
Orton told The Sun : `` The term ` Sugaring Season ' refers to the time in the late winter or early spring in New England and elsewhere , when they tap the maple trees to make maple syrup .
In the cold nights and warm days , the sap flows ... it is very much a time of reckoning and of introspection and darkness and light .
It takes a lot of sap to make a little bit of sugar .
`` Orton 's husband , American folk singer Sam Amidon , is from the New England state of Vermont and they consequently spend a lot of time there .
Here are a few more songs on our database that reference the poetry of Robert Frost : `` Uncle John 's Band '' by Grateful Dead .
`` Stay Gold '' by The Big Pink .
`` Dead Man 's Curve '' by Jan & Dean .
The lyric , `` Oh please do n't stand a mood apart '' was borrowed from Robert Frost 's 1947 short poem , A Mood Apart .
-LRB- `` I stopped my song and almost heart .
For any eye is an evil eye .
That looks in onto a mood apart . '' -RRB-
According to Orton , Frost 's poem , `` uses nature to capture a sense of ` innocence regained , ' '' which is one of the themes of Sugaring Season .
