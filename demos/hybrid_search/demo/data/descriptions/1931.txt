This song was co-written by Atlanta hard rockers Injected .
David Cook explained to Entertainment Weekly : `` I 'm a big fan of this band Injected , out of Atlanta .
We called them up and said , can we have a run at this song and see what happens ?
What they sent us was a demo version , so we took the idea and ran with it .
It 's heavy , but still a strong melody . ''
