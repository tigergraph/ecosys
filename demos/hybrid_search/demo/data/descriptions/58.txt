During the Christmas of 2011 , drummer and MS sufferer Aaron Kowalewicz broke the news to his band mates that he would soon be undergoing heart surgery to repair a leaky aortic valve .
Fortunately the operation went well and he healed quickly .
Shaken by their bandmate 's surgery , the other three Billy Talent members gave this song a lyrical turn : `` Aaron has a charity called the F.U.M.S. organization -LRB- F -- k You Multiple Sclerosis -RRB- , and one of their slogans was ` Turn Anger Into Hope ' .
I thought that was a pretty cool line or lyric , and we put it in the song , `` said singer Ben Kowalewicz .
`` The thing with Aaron jarred all of us ; it was pretty shocking and tough to wrap your head around , especially after all the things he 's already been through .
That really shook the foundation and it came at a weird point as well , we were already so far -LRB- in the recording process -RRB- .
But when you put everything in context of Aaron 's situation , then the rest is pretty small . ''
