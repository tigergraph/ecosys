After paying tribute to Jay-Z on `` HOV Lane , '' Minaj borrows the title of a Jigga song for this track .
The heart-shaped pop ballad about a crush is the pinkiest part of the Pink Friday : Roman Reloaded album .
Its beat comes courtesy of hitmaker Dr Luke , the man behind many of Britney Spears and Katy Perry 's hits .
Originally , the album was scheduled to be released on Valentine 's Day , so we suspect that this prom-night tune was initially earmarked to be released as its lead single .
Sheehan witnessed Minaj 's dedication and enthusiasm firsthand .
`` She 's kind of like a kid in the studio .
She 's so excited and so passionate , '' she said , `` We were bouncing ideas back and forth constantly for awhile .
We had three other concepts before landing on ` Young Forever . '
When we finally hit that one , we were like , ` This is it ! '
The song just sort of wrote itself after that . ''
The song was co-written by songwriter Kelly Sheehan , who is signed to Dr. Luke 's production company .
Minaj had already chosen the beat so all that was left for Sheehan to do was provide the lyrics and melodies .
`` I just started doing melodies on the hook and coming up with some general ideas , '' she told MTV News .
`` We played it for Nicki and she loved it .
Then me and Nicki ended up going in the room and wrote the record together .
All the ideas were pretty much done on-the-spot .
Pretty fresh . ''
