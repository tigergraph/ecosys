Elliott wrote and produced this song with Timbaland , who also worked on her debut single `` The Rain -LRB- Supa Dupa Fly -RRB- . ''
This track came together very quickly when Timbaland was working with some Indian music he discovered in his travels .
The beat was based on Bhangra music , which gave it a very unusual sound .
Timbaland used a one-stringed guitar called a tumbi and recorded individual notes into a keyboard .
`` Get Ur Freak On '' marked Elliott 's first music video collaboration without Hype Williams , the creative mind behind her trademark futuristic look .
The problem was , Elliott did n't want a trademark and was already feeling pigeonholed to fit the image that was expertly laid out for her in Williams ' videos .
`` You see , I change my music and I change my image at the same time .
I felt like as long as me and Hype continued to work together we would probably keep it going in the same kinda of direction , '' she told interviewer Amy Linden .
Instead , she turned to Dave Meyers , another prolific director known for his work on Outkast 's `` So Fresh , So Clean '' video and frequent collaborations with Pink , among others .
Meyers became Elliott 's go-to director for her next ten videos .
In the April , 2007 issue of Blender magazine , Elliott explained the meaning of the song : `` It could be about dancing - the bedroom , whatever .
You 're cleaning your house ?
Get your freak on ! ''
