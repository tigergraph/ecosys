This somber piano ballad is a bonus track from Justin Bieber 's third remix album , Believe Acoustic .
The song was written and produced by Justin with the collaboration of his musical director Dan Kanter .
It finds the Canadian teen expressing his feelings about his breakup with Selena Gomez , whom he dated for two years before splitting in late 2012 .
`` It tells the whole story about how he broke up with her , she begged him to take her back , and then he decided he was done for good , '' a source told US Weekly .
`` This is his answer to Selena . ''
This was a last-minute addition to Believe Acoustic .
Manager Scooter Braun tweeted shortly before its release : `` Up early working hard to get this last minute very heartfelt song the kid just wrote onto the #BelieveAcoustic album .
# 11songs . ''
When Believe Acoustic debuted at # 1 on the Billboard 200 , Justin was still only 18 .
In doing so he became the youngest artist to top the album chart five times .
The song , particularly the second verse , appears to hint that the blame for the breakup rests on Gomez 's shoulders .
However , rather being angry , Justin showcases his hurt at the ending of their relationship .
During an interview with Billboard magazine , the interviewer commented to him that the song `` feels . ''
Justin responded : `` Because at the end of the day , there 's nothing like us , you know ?
That 's just it .
It is what it is .
People are going to relate to that . ''
The video was directed by Colin Tilley and produced by London Alley Entertainment .
It was recorded on January 28 , 2013 in Los Angeles .
