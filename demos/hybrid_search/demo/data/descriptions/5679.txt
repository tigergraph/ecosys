This offbeat folk stomp is an arrangement by Plant and Buddy Miller of American newspaper editor , poet and abolitionist Theodore Tilton 's 1867 poem , The King 's Ring .
The lyric is a meditation on mortality in which a Persian king learns that fame and fortune are temporary , but so are pain and disease .
Chuck Berry previously used this poem as the basis for `` Pass Away '' the closing track from his 1979 studio album , Rock It .
