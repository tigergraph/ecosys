This song finds an angry Jesse Leach railing against two-faced authorities and institutions .
`` That 's a pretty pissed off song , '' he told Artist Direct .
`` I had personal issues in mind but also corrupt government and the hypocrisy of organized religion .
You 're in that state of mind where you 're so angry and there 's nothing you can do about it .
You 're tired of people speaking for you and pretending like they know where you 're coming from .
That 's pretty much it .
It 's the anger of people being hypocritical and betraying . ''
