Joni Mitchell performs this track solo accompanying herself on the acoustic guitar .
It might be described as a slightly enigmatic song about a woman who waits for night to fall then , taking her pistol , aims a shot at a streetlight .
She always misses , but tells herself the day she hits the light is the day she will leave .
On November 13 , 1994 , the Canadian singer-songwriter was interviewed by Tracey Macleod for the BBC2 TV programme The Late Show , which was broadcast December 6 .
Asked if `` Sunny Sunday '' was about herself , she replied : '' ... it 's not autobiographical .
Actually it 's kind of a composite portrait .
I have a friend who I paint with , who had a roommate who did this ... '' Joni Mitchell actually trained as an artist , and like Rolf Harris of `` Tie Me Kangaroo Down ... '' fame she became an entertainer by accident , ie using her musical skills to pay for her education and then realising that maybe her part-time job was her true vocation .
In the interview she continued . ''
... it 's just the story of a woman waiting for some little change to give a new direction ... it 's a kind of a mysterious little song .
It 's also the shortest song I ever wrote . ''
