This brooding blues-rocker features a spoken-word intro from Refried Ice Cream 's Danny Brewer , one of several monologues dotted throughout The People 's Key .
Bright Eyes leader Conor Oberst met him while recording the Mystic Valley Band 's Outer South album in El Paso , Texas .
Oberst told Spinner about Brewer 's contributions : `` That 's a friend of mine , this guy named Denny who I met when I was making a record outside of El Paso .
He 's a really interesting guy .
He has a band called Refried Ice Cream , which I highly recommend , and he 's just one of those characters I met along the way .
When I was writing the songs for this record , I kept thinking about him because I realized a lot of these ideas came from conversations I had with him .
I asked if he would n't mind committing some of it to tape to be used in the context of the album and he was gracious enough to do that . ''
`` Firewall '' is a downtempo , acoustic song with a slow build-up .
It addresses themes of modern life with poetic references to dreams , mythology , inventor Nikola Tesla , and drinking .
