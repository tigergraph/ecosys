Having borrowed Elbow 's rehearsal room for some writing sessions , the `` One Day Like This '' band 's spirit seems to have seeped into this track .
Everything Everything bassist Jeremy Pritchard explained to NME : `` When I first heard the demo for ` The Peaks ' I thought it was quite Elbow .
It 's simple , does n't work too hard . ''
Like `` Radiant , '' this song was finessed on the road .
Pritchard told The Line Of Best Fit : `` We 're not really a band that jams during the soundcheck and writes things on the road but we used that time to work on it a little more .
In terms of the arrangement , it was set in stone before we went on the road . ''
