This is about a man who 's love was raped and killed by five men as she picked herbs at night .
The song talks about the men 's lust for her -LRB- `` By her taffeta lay of her hips that held sway '' -RRB- and his destined love for her .
It eventually leads up to his killing of the men and his suicide -LRB- `` I embrace where lovers rot '' -RRB- .
He is haunted by her ghost in the fog .
