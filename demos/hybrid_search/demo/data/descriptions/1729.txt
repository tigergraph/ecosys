This is the second single released from Rita Ora 's debut album , ORA , in the US .
The record title represents more than just the singer 's last name , as it also means `` time '' in her country of birth , Kosovo , and it took Ora a long time to get the LP completed .
`` The name of the album made sense because it 's taken two and a half years to record , '' she told ASOS.com .
`` I was frustrated .
I 'd be in the studio and get pi -- ed off and walk out , like , ` Why ca n't I write anything ? '
But you have to swallow your frustration and keep going .
I did n't force it that 's why it took so long .
If I did n't have anything to write about , I would n't write . ''
The song was penned for Ora by Australian singer-songwriter Sia , who has also collaborated and performed with such artists as Flo Rida -LRB- `` Wild Ones '' -RRB- and David Guetta -LRB- `` Titanium '' -RRB- .
It was produced by Greg Kurstin -LRB- Lily Allen , Kylie Minogue , Natasha Bedingfield -RRB- .
