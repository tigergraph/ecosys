In 2010 German motor racing driver Michael Schumacher made a surprise return to Formula 1 at the age of 41 .
Clearly past his best , Schumacher failed to win a race , obtain a pole position , a place on the podium or the fastest lap .
Despite the relative failure of his comeback , he retained the respect of his fellow drivers and still had cause to celebrate his motor racing career .
Spanish F1 driver Fernando Alonso said of the German legend : `` He will be always super class ; if the car is right , he will be a contender that we will fear most .
`` This song finds vocalist Matthew Murphy singing : `` Schumacher the Champagne never needed good cause to celebrate . ''
He explained the song title to The Sun : `` A friend of mine in Liverpool mentioned the phrase to me .
Schumacher is a verb .
Well , it 's not yet but I hope it will become one .
The idea of blasting a champagne cork in the air and spraying the foam into your face even though you came last felt quite exciting . ''
