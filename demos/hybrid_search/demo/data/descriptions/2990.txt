It 's actually difficult to get much information on the infamous last ever album by The Clash , mainly because the group themselves try to airbrush most of their post-1983 history out .
It was a dark period after the firing of Mick Jones and Topper Headon , the latter of whom had descended badly into drug addiction , and their creative inspiration was sorely missed when it came time to writing an album for the `` Clash Mk.II '' as it 's derogatorily referred to now .
An even worse decision was letting controversial manager Bernie Rhodes become lead songwriter .
The entire Cut the Crap album is regarded as a disaster from start to finish .
This song intially featured in Clash Mk.II 's live set as `` Are You Ready for War '' when they toured the new lineup in 1984 .
The lyrics are a low-grade rehash of the themes explored on earlier tracks such as `` Charlie Do n't Surf '' -LRB- from 1980 's Sandinista !
record -RRB- , looking at global conflict and Ronald Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative .
It ends up relying on poor rhyming couplets and generic stereotypes about vodka and the Kremlin to make its point , all the while surrounded by poor low-grade 1980s keyboards and synthesisers .
The Clash were always known for pushing the boundaries and not just being a Punk rock band , but previous stylistic changes at least had creative merit - this just sounds like a poor attempt to jump on the electronic instrument bandwagon that took over most of music in the 1980s .
