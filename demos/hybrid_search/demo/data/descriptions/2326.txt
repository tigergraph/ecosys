Michaelson told Billboard magazine why she released this ukulele-strumming one-off single in between her third and fourth album : `` It 's very poppy and different from what I 've done in the past , which is pretty much straight down-the-middle , singer/songwriter stuff , '' she explained .
`` I just felt like I wanted to put something out .
I 'm not ready to put a full album out , so we thought we 'd put this out and see how people take it or do n't take it . ''
Michaelson penned this song with Los Angeles based songwriter/producer Marshall Altman .
This song represents a step in a new direction for Michaelson .
She told Spinner : `` I 'm very happy with where I am , but I 'm really getting bored to tears with the whole singer-songwriter thing .
I 've done everything I can in that realm .
That 's why ` Parachute ' is really good for me .
It 's really poppy and I do n't want to say balls in an interview , but it 's got more balls .
It has more power .
It feels good .
It feels strong . ''
The song 's sound was influenced by Train 's , `` Hey Soul Sister , '' which brought the ukulele to the forefront of a big hit .
`` I heard that song and I was like , ` Wait a second ... oh well , there goes that ' , '' Michaelson said with a laugh .
`` What I did is now stamped on that song forever - that very , very catchy song that will never go out of our brains . ''
The song was originally recorded in 2009 by Girls Aloud member and X-Factor judge Cheryl Cole .
Her version peaked at # 5 on the UK singles chart .
