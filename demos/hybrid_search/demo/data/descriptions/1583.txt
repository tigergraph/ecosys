Written by bass player Les Holroyd , who also provided the vocal , `` Sip Of Wine '' is described in the June 1994 issue of the Nova Lepidoptera fanzine as `` A cautionary tale of the perils of being seduced by groupies ! ''
The sheet music which was originally published by St Anne 's Music of Manchester in 1979 was also published in the June 1992 issue of the same magazine .
Although the two songs are chalk and cheese , the start of `` Sip Of Wine '' is strikingly similar melodically to the Who 's `` Baba O'Riley . ''
