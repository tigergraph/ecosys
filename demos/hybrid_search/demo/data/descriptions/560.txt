Here 's a new music distribution model that we doubt will catch on : This epic slow-burner was premiered on April 1 , 2012 when 1000 flexi-disc records containing the tune were attached to helium balloons and launched from White 's label headquarters in Nashville .
Accompanying the balloons were postcards with instructions for the finders to submit photos , discovery location and the date on which the vinyl record was found .
The song 's music promo was White 's first collaboration with video director Hype Williams , best known for his work with hip-hop artists like Nicki Minaj -LRB- `` Stupid Hoe '' -RRB- and Kanye West -LRB- `` All of The Lights '' -RRB- .
It finds White getting arrested by a sexy highway patrol officer and thrown into jail , only to find his female cellmate just ca n't keep her hands to herself .
They escape , but White 's bright green vintage HEMI ` Cuda ca n't outrun the cops .
In an interview with CBS Local , White revealed that he actually did his own stunt driving in the canyons outside Los Angeles .
White explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` This is about 21st mortality .
There 's a lot of new technology , but back in the day when the telephone was invented people were taught telephone etiquette .
And I think now as new inventions are created , there 's no class that goes along with this . ''
At the 2013 Grammy Awards , White played this song with an all-male band after performing his song `` Love Interruption '' with an all-female group .
