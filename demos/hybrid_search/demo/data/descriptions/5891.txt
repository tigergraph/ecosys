According to vocalist-keyboardist Alejandra Deheza and multi-instrumentalist Benjamin Curtis , The School of Seven Bells ' third album Ghostory is , `` the tale of a young girl named Lafaye and the ghosts that surround her life . ''
Deheza explained to Consequence of Sound the ghostly concept : `` For me , ghosts are what I call those people and situations that you carry with you everywhere .
Because they remind me of ghosts .
They 're these entities that are whispering to you constantly and reminding you of things .
Sometimes you 'll go into a situation , and it 'll remind you of five different people at five different points in your life .
Maybe the situation is you run into someone that you 're uncomfortable being around or even somebody that you miss , you know ?
It 's just the way that I see those kind of mixed emotions .
They do remind me of people that follow you around everywhere . ''
Ghostory is the first SVIIB album to feature live drums , but Curtis reverted back to his original approach on a couple of tracks .
He told SonicScoop : `` We also recorded drums for the songs ` Love Play ' and ` Show Me Love , ' but I actually wound up going back to an electronic approach for those .
It was just a dimension I missed .
There 's a dimension you get with electronic sounds that music ca n't get otherwise .
It 's a color , and everything is there to tell the story of the song better . ''
