This tragic , gothic rock ballad is the most powerful and naked song Courtney Love has ever written about the feelings of loss over her late husband , Kurt Cobain .
The NME asked Love why this has come out of her now , at this particular point in time .
She replied : `` As I said in 1991 , I 'm not psychic , but my lyrics certainly seem to be .
It 's really weird that way .
All of it 's hard .
I never knew what it was all about , this record .
And then last night I was doing a photoshoot and I was suddenly weeping .
But I never knew what it was about .
I just went with my soul . ''
