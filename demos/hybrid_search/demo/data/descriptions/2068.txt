This high-energy David Guetta-produced number sees Rihanna returning to the world of dance music after the darker tracks she recorded for Rated R .
The song leaked online on September 17 , 2010 .
Guetta said to MTV News regarding helping Rihanna return to dance music : `` Well , you know , I 'm a DJ , so I make beats that make you wan na dance .
And I think she was one of the first to do that in that urban world , so you know , I think it would be good for her to do it again . ''
The colourful Japanese-pop inspired video was directed by Jonas Akerlund -LRB- Lady Gaga 's `` Paparazzi '' and `` Telephone '' -RRB- and was filmed for an online commercial for Doritos .
It shows a fun-loving Rihanna making her way through a rainbow fantasy world clad in a multicolored ensemble .
Rihanna admitted to Entertainment Weekly that the somewhat predictable `` in the club '' vibe of the song is similar to a number of other hits and was probably not her best work : `` That 's why it 's a bonus track and not on Loud , '' she said .
`` It 's a great song , but it 's safe .
It 's like a lot of other songs out there . ''
The song debuted at # 9 on the UK singles chart dated December 5 , 2010 .
The two songs placed above it were also Rihanna tracks - `` What 's My Name ? ''
-LRB- # 8 -RRB- and `` Only Girl -LRB- In The World -RRB- '' -LRB- # 7 -RRB- .
This made Rihanna the first act in chart history to line up at consecutive places with three singles since Frankie Laine , who in the week of October 17 1953 was at # 2 with `` I Believe '' # 3 with `` Hey Joe '' and # 4 with `` When The Wind Blows .
`` Another feat achieved by Rihanna with the arrival of this song on the UK singles chart is she became the first act to have managed a trio of Top 10 hits at the same time since John Lennon had three singles in the upper reaches in the first weeks of 1981 .
A third video was filmed in December 2010 in Los Angeles showing David Guetta DJing on a spaceship while watching Rihanna dancing on various monitors .
The Bajan singer 's actual scenes are the same as the Doritos ' day version clip .
The video has a Star Trek feel , and Guetta 's scenes were actually filmed in a former `` Trek '' studio .
The French dance maestro told MTV News .
`` It 's actually really funny , because we shot that in Los Angeles in a place where the used to shoot ` Star Trek , ' but like the old ones .
And so it 's kind of retro futuristic , you know ?
It 's like how people were seeing the future back in the '80s .
It has a sense of humor in the video . ''
Guetta originally previewed the heavily auto-tuned track earlier in 2010 on French radio .
Both a `` day '' and `` night '' version of the video was recorded , the idea being that the user can toggle back and forth between both versions while the video streams .
Rihanna explained to Entertainment Weekly : `` This is the first time my fans will be able to interact with me in one of my videos .
We shot the video for ` Who 's That Chick ' in two versions : day and night .
With the Doritos bag you 'll be able to change back and forth between the two videos and it will be different every time . ''
This was released as a digital download on November 22 , 2010 and served as the lead single from the re-release of Guetta 's fourth studio album , One Love .
Guetta told the story of this song in an interview with MTV News : `` Bu , which is Akon 's brother , was doing the A&R on the new album for Rihanna -LSB- and -RSB- came to me and asked me for some tracks , '' recalled Guetta .
`` And I was feeling terrible because I 'm such a huge fan but I did n't have any beats that would fit .
I just did n't have any ideas .
Sometimes two artists wan na work together , but it does n't mean it 's gon na happen , because you have to find the right idea .
`` Eventually Guetta had a breakthough .
`` I came up with the idea for the song for ` Who 's That Chick , ' and I said , ` That 's it .
It 's perfect ! ' ''
he continued .
`` I went to see her in London ; she was having a concert .
And just before the concert , I went to see her backstage and I played her the record and she was like , ` Yeah , I like it . '
But I think she was doubting it a little bit .
And then after the concert , I saw her again and she was like , ` That record is stuck in my head ! '
And I was like , ` OK , let 's do it ! '
Finally , which is really amazing for me , we did it as ` David Guetta featuring Rihanna . '
It 's a great honor for me . ''
