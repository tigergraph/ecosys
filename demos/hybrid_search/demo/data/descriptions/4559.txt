This is a track from Lonely Avenue , a collaboration album by English novelist Nick Hornby and American singer-songwriter Ben Folds .
Hornby often writes about music , musicians , and music lovers in his fiction and non-fiction work .
His novels include High Fidelity and About a Boy .
The pair hatched the plan for Lonely Avenue during a dinner conversation one night in 2009 .
After that , Hornby began regularly emailing lyrics to Folds , who then wrote the music .
Folds told Billboard magazine : `` With Nick 's lyrics , sometimes all it really needed was one chord and two notes and that was going to bring the lyrics out and move people the most .
And if I knew in the back of my head that a great deal of my audience - that was kind of music-oriented - was going to ask ` Why did he make it so simple ? '
Well , I 'm serving the lyrics so I had to take myself out of it . ''
This song is a tribute to the work of Doc Pomus , lyricist of countless '50s and '60s pop hits including The Drifters ' `` Save The Last Dance For Me , '' Dion & the Belmonts ' `` A Teenager in Love '' and Elvis Presley 's `` Viva Las Vegas . ''
The album title is taken from Doc Pomus ' breakthrough song `` Lonely Avenue , '' which was a rhythm and blues hit for Ray Charles in 1956 .
