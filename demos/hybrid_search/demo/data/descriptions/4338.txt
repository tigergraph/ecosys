This is the first single from Flamingo , the debut studio album by American singer/songwriter and The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers .
The song was played for the first time on June 14th , 2010 in the UK on Zane Lowe 's Radio 1 show and was released on June 21st in the USA and Canada .
Many of Flamingo 's tracks were originally intended for a Killers album .
But when the band decided to take a break , Flowers was n't ready to stop recording .
The Nevada-born singer told Zane Lowe why he decided to record a solo album : `` This started out that way - it just became something else when I realized I was n't ready to take a very long break and a couple of the guys were .
It was weird .
Without union and the Killers and that way of doing things and friendship .
I had fun making the record but that brotherhood did n't exist .
At times it was a little bit lonely .
It was n't born out of a need to do something different or to get attention or anything else - it was really to make music . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Nash Edgerton and features Charlize Theron .
The South African actress plays a heroine who rescues Flowers from being tortured by ninjas on three separate occasions .
Flowers told NME how he persuaded Theron to appear in the clip : `` She loved the song and wanted to be involved !
I 've been lucky with how responsive people have been to a phone call !
It 's a very symbolic video . ''
The song was produced by Stuart Price , who helmed the Killers ' 2008 album Day & Age and who has twiddled knobs for many other artists including Madonna and Kylie Minogue .
This acoustic-driven song found favor in Flowers ' family .
`` That 's my son Ammon 's favorite , '' he told Rolling Stone , smiling .
`` Kids can always pick the hits . ''
