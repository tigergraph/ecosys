The English Rain album title is taken from a line in this epic , choral song .
Aplin explained to Coup De Main magazine : `` It was really random , I did n't know what I wanted to call it , but I did n't want to call it a track or just an album name .
So ` English Rain ' is part of a lyric in one of my songs , and I was like ` well that could be quite a cool name ' and then when we did the photography for it we ended up using the umbrella photo and I was like , ` cool that fits . ' ''
`` Then , really near the end of the recording process , '' she continued , `` we went to RAK Studios in London and we were able to record these big string sections and orchestral parts , and after playing it all back there was this English Wartime theme to it , and I was like ... it just seems right , we just have to call it ` English Rain ' . ''
