This song is about the financial difficulties farmers in the Midwest US face ; difficulties that can go as far as having their farms repossessed by banks .
Mellencamp wrote the song with his friend George Green , who he worked with on many of this tracks , including `` Hurts So Good . ''
`` Our songs always came about the same way : talk around the kitchen table , '' Mellencamp told Rolling Stone .
`` I had just played ` Small Town ' for him .
He said , `` I do n't know why these towns are going out of business '' - towns like Freetown and Dudleytown , Indiana .
We could n't figure out why they were disappearing .
We did our research and wrote this song - Reagan had been using grain against the Soviet Union and all sorts of other things .
Talking to people was heartbreaking .
Nobody wanted to lose their farm . ''
Mellencamp has taken an active role in helping American farmers .
Along with Neil Young and Willie Nelson , he regularly plays at the Farm-Aid concerts to help raise money .
