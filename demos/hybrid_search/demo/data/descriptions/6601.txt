This anti-hater anthem finds Pittsburgh rapper Mac Miller addressing his critics .
He explained to Billboard magazine : '' ` Smile Back ' was my one opportunity to say ` f -- k you . '
You know , I am a positive , happy dude .
What do I really have to be ?
With all the horrible things that happen to people in the world what do I really , really have to be sad about ?
But that was my one song -LSB- where -RSB- I was like , ` Ugh ! '
` F -- k you ! '
I just wanted to be able to say that and it felt so good .
That song feels so good to perform .
It relieves so much stress to say that . ''
The song became Mac Miller 's highest-charting song of his career to date , when it debuted at # 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week of the release of Blue Slide Park .
This was a surprise to chart-watchers as it had n't been released as an official single .
