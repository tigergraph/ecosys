This was inspired by the poem To His Coy Mistress by Andrew Marvell .
Used in the film A Nightmare on Elm Street : The Dream Child , the fifth installment of the horror series .
The version used on the soundtrack featured Janick Gers on guitar , before he had actually joined the band .
Dickinson : `` Here I tried to sum up what I thought Nightmare On Elm Street movies are really about , and it 's all about adolescent fear of period pains .
That 's what I think it is - deep down .
When a young girl first gets her period she bleeds and it happens at night , and so she is afraid to go to sleep and it 's a very terrifying time for her , sexually as well , and Nightmare On Elm Street targets that fear .
The real slaughter in the Freddie movies is when she loses her virginity .
That is the rather nasty thought behind it all , but that 's what makes those kind of movies frightening . ''
This is the band 's highest charting single to date .
-LRB- thanks , Brett - Edmonton , Canada , for all above -RRB- The `` single '' -LRB- the cover of which depicted Eddie romancing a red devil woman in an alley in Gotham City , the bat-signal visible clearly with several Maiden-esque creatures on the ground -RRB- was really more of a mini-album .
Besides the title track , there were two covers : `` I 'm a Mover '' -LRB- originally by the band Free for their 1968 album Ton of Sobs -RRB- and `` Communication Breakdown '' -LRB- originally by Led Zeppelin for their 1969 album Led Zeppelin -RRB- .
The Nightmare on Elm Street version is usually considered an independent work by lead singer Bruce Dickinson because the band was n't involved and only recorded it after the film and soundtrack were released .
This was released on December 24 and quickly hit # 1 on the UK charts .
It stayed there for 2 weeks .
Listeners of BBC Radio 1 voted this the second best # 1 single of all time in January 2005 .
Queen 's `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' was voted # 1 .
-LRB- thanks , Tom - Trowbridge , England -RRB-
