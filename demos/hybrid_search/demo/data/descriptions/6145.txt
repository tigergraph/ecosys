This slice of Synth-Pop finds Lauren Mayberry trying to figure out a relationship that is hanging in the balance as she desperately urges her companion to love her or leave her .
She croons : `` Carved .
Earth .
Cold Hiding from you in this skin .
So .
Old . ''
The song was originally the title track of Chvrches debut EP .
It was subsequently released as the second single from the Scottish trio 's first studio album The Bones of What You Believe peaking at # 91 on the UK Singles Chart .
Mayberry told Coup De Main magazine how the Chvrches trio pen their songs .
`` It 's a three-part writing process - everyone 's equally involved in all the writing , '' she explained .
`` Normally we 'll start with a sample or a drumbeat , or a synth sound or something like that , and that will spark the initial idea .
And then we 'll write an instrumental sketch of a song , and then we put on a nonsense vocal melody , which is always my favourite bit because it obviously sounds amazing .
Then the lyrics go on last , at the end . ''
