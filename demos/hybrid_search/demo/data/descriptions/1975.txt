This is about the effects of alcoholism , which is a bit ironic since Lynyrd Skynyrd played almost every concert under the influence of alcohol .
An acoustic version sung by Johnny Van Zant appears on their album Endangered Species .
-LRB- thanks , Aaron - Twin Cities , MN , for all above -RRB- Johnny Walker , as mentioned in the lyrics , is a Scotch whiskey that comes in four types : red label -LRB- basic -RRB- , black label -LRB- 12 year -RRB- , gold label -LRB- 18 year -RRB- , and blue label -LRB- very top shelf -RRB- .
This song is track three , side two , of Lynyrd Skynyrd 's landmark first album .
Their producer Al Kooper was initially nervous about the band name , and begged them to change it .
When they would n't budge , he devised a clever ad campaign before the first album release , in a bid to drive the name of the band into the public 's mind .
He designed a skull head and a bones-styled typeface , and took out ads in music trade magazines and major-city alternative weekly newspapers , with an ad that simply said `` Who is Lynyrd Skynyrd ? ''
Each week , the size of the ad grew and held a few more details , until finally it became a huge two-page ad on the day of the album 's release.Immediately after the MCA ad campaign , Pete Townsend of The Who dropped by MCA studios looking for an opening act for the Quadrophenia tour .
Who should they find but the hot , young and eager Lynyrd Skynyrd ?
Thanks to the lucky coincidence of their first album 's ad campaign , it looked like they 'd planned to tour with The Who the whole time !
