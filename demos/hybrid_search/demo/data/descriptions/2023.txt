This is an absolutely terrifying song that according to lead singer Scooter Ward , is about a man who did harm to a child and/or someone close to him , and the child getting his revenge later - in a very graphic way : `` I can see the bodies on the wall , and all the nightmare dreams I ca n't recall , I can see the fire burning , I used to feel alive , I 'll watch you burn .
`` Scooter screams that last line incessantly towards the end of the song , as if imploring the child to take his revenge .
