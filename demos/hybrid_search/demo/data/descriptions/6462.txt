This song is about how frontman Isaac Slade dealt with the death of his beloved grandfather .
He explained to The Sun February 6 , 2009 : `` I felt lost , all these emotions and those songs came out .
But then , 12 months ago , I was talking to a friend of mine who gave me some perspective on it and some books to read .
I realized I was seeing only the pure realism side of it all and there is good in life still , even though people die or have miscarriages , whatever .
And I began to have hope again . ''
