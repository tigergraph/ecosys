This song finds vocalist Charlie Fink looking back fondly on N&TH 's early days playing in west London folk-den Bosun 's locker bar .
`` Obviously there 's a nostalgia to it , he told NME , `` but that 's partly what ` Old Joy ' is about , not holding on to things too long , letting go , that good times in your life sometimes have full stops on them . ''
The song features gospel vocals by the legendary Waters Sisters , who once backed Michael Jackson on his hit `` Wan na Be Startin ' Somethin' . ''
Fink discussed their contribution in an interview with Gigwise : `` It was genuinely amazing .
I basically said to Jason , who we made the record with , that I wanted some gospel vocals , and he said that if I wanted that type of sound they were who I needed to see .
He had already recorded with them on a Jenny Lewis track .
They were one of the great pleasures of the album .
One of my favourite parts was when we were all around the piano singing ` Old Joy ' for the first time together , working out harmonies .
There 's just something magical when you get a harmony right .
It was a real treat to get to play with them . ''
