Filter 's sixth album was named after this track .
In an interview with ABC News Radio , the band 's leader Richard Patrick said that the record title was inspired by his former drug use .
`` In my lifetime , the sun definitely came out at night , '' he said .
`` I 'm a recovering drug addict and a recovering alcoholic , but when I was taking drugs , there were a few nights where my blood turned into golden , beautiful sunshine .
It was all chemical-based , and I knew it was a lie , but it was completely overwhelming , and it was like the sun had come out at night . ''
Patrick told Artist Direct about his past drug-addicted times , which he recalls in this song : `` I 'd come back from these Nine Inch Nails tours , '' he said , `` and I 'd go on these adventures in the city of Cleveland .
I 'd walk around from ten o'clock until five in the morning on acid and riding drawbridges .
You 'd get underneath a drawbridge , hold on to it , and ride it up as a lake liner would pass .
I lived this strange of life of being on drugs at night and feeling like the sun had come out and gave hope . ''
