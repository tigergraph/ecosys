This is the title track of the third studio album by singer Mike Rosenberg who records under the moniker of Passenger .
Born and bred in the United Kingdom , Rosenberg first took his act in October 2009 to Australia where he has earned a big following .
All but one of the All The Little Lights tracks were recorded at Sydney 's Linear Recording studio .
He was joined by a core Australian band that included Boy & Bear drummer Tim Hart , jazz bassist Cameron Undy , and keyboards player Stu Hunter , from Katie Noonan & The Captains .
Passenger told VH1 that it is difficult to explain this song 's meaning `` without sounding a bit like a hippie . ''
He added : `` I think it 's important with songwriting that you 're honest , and you 're vulnerable .
There 's a balance , because you do n't want to specifically talk about yourself the whole time .
You want to relate to people , and you want to give them the opportunity to put their own emotions into these songs -- but every now and again , I like to put something specific and personal into them . ''
