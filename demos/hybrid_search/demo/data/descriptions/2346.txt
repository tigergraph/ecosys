This track from the Christian Rock band Red 's third full-length album , Until We Have Faces has the subject matter of fighting off the devil .
Singer Michael Barnes explained to Artist Direct : `` We 've had a couple of songs like that on past records .
On the first record , it was ` Wasting Time . '
It 's that anthem song yelling at the devil saying , ` You do n't own me .
I 'm going to watch you crawl . '
It 's really an empowering song .
I love all kinds of music from the harder stuff to the ballad-y thing .
For me as a musician , I do n't like to go in one area such as hardcore screaming all the time .
I like how there 's a variety .
It can get really emotional with the screams , and then there will be this soft , tender moment which will open up another whole emotional level for some people out there . ''
