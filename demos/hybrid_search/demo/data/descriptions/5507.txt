This was released as the second single from the Brooklyn-based indie rock band Grizzly Bear 's fourth studio album , Shields .
Regarding the record 's lyrical content , singer Ed Droste noted to UK newspaper The Sun : `` I hate over-explaining lyrics because I love listeners to find their own meanings in them .
But our album as a whole is about the overarching sensibility where you really want to be autonomous and alone all the time , but at the same time you 're afraid of being alone and feel you need to find a partner , couple up and get domestic .
It 's about navigating that tricky terrain and finding the balance where you 're happy in between . ''
The surreal Emily Kai Bock directed video follows a young figure skater as she tries to perfect her technique during a difficult practice , until she ends up crashing through the ice .
This leads her on a journey through a carnival and into a forest , where a backwoods quartet comes to her aid .
