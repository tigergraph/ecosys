This album-closing ballad was written by the group together with the album 's co-producer Wayne Kirkpatrick .
The quartet felt a personal connection to the lyric about hope , perseverance and overcoming adversity .
`` It was Wayne 's lyrical idea , his hook , '' Karen Fairchild told Reuters .
`` He said he was thinking about us and our story . ''
Phillip Sweet of Little Big Town told us : '' ` Lean Into It ' was one I really love on this record that I think was a very focused emotion that we wanted to talk about and write about .
And I just love that whole lyric and what it says about us .
It 's our story of persevering through tough times and I just love that song.It was a group effort .
The idea started with Wayne .
He was inspired by our story of perseverance and we 're always having to fight these little battles along the way , and it 's never just been an easy path , like when you have one big song and you skyrocket to the top .
It 's always been a slower build for us , but it 's always been strong and solid .
So he was inspired by that story of us persevering and always holding our heads high .
It builds strength when you can really work your muscles like that , emotional muscles .
And instead of backing down when something scares you a little bit , just push through it .
You 're going to be okay on the other side of it .
And I think we 've kind of learned that by experience .
So the years together and being together and having each other to hold one another 's hand , so to speak , through the dark times , it 's been the most rewarding thing .
And I know I have great friends above all else , and that 's really cool . ''
