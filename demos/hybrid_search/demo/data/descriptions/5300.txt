This was inspired by an encounter with a 10-year-old fan .
`` She had this beautiful red hair , this beautiful skin , these beautiful green eyes , and she was looking up at me , holding -LSB- out -RSB- for an autograph , '' Parton recalled to NPR in 2008 .
`` I said , ` Well , you 're the prettiest little thing I ever saw .
So what is your name ? '
And she said , ` Jolene . '
And I said , ` Jolene .
Jolene .
Jolene .
Jolene .
That is pretty .
That sounds like a song .
I 'm going to write a song about that . ' ''
Some of the many artists who have covered this : The White Stripes , Reba McEntire , Olivia Newton-John and 10,000 Maniacs .
-LRB- thanks , MARK - Boston , MA , for all above -RRB- This was written and recorded around the time Parton was leaving one-time singing partner and manager Porter Wagoner .
The song became the first of 5 consecutive # 1 Country hits and created momentum as Dolly embarked on her solo career .
It was also the only one out of the 5 to cross over to the American Pop charts .
The song was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2014 .
It was Parton 's second tune to receive the prestigious honor - `` I Will Always Love You '' was included in 2007 .
