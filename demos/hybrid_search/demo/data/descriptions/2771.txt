There 's nothing sugary about this aggressive track , which is full of furious lyrics .
`` When I started ` Sweet , ' as soon as I started talking on it , I was like , ` Yo , this is hip-hop , this is what I do , ' '' Common told MTV News .
`` It was a lot I had to get off my chest on that .
And at the same token , I love hip-hop music and raw rap music , for me it was like , ` Man , I 'm gon na go ahead and give them this side of me too . ' ''
The song samples Doris & Kelley 's 1967 soul classic , `` You Do n't Have to Worry . ''
Common later admitted that the song is partly a jibe at Drake 's vocal stylings .
He told MTV News : `` The verse is about me but when you hear some of the stuff on the chorus it 's like you ca n't help but think about -LSB- the -RSB- dude and I guess that 's what he felt .
So at the end of day he fits in that category , he already embraced it , so wear it .
`` Common went on to recognize Drake 's talent , saying : `` He 's a very successful artist obviously and like I said , he 's a talented artist too - I give credit where it 's due . ''
The song finds Common mocking some unidentified `` singing '' MCs for getting all `` Frank Sinatra '' on their records .
The Chicago MC denied he was directly targeting specific singer/rappers such as Drake .
`` The great thing about hip-hop , you definitely get motivated by other hip-hop artists , '' he explained to MTV News .
`` You get in the ring and you 'll be like , ` Let 's go , ' but for me , it 's like , I 'm talking to whoever feels it , whoever when they hear it , they 're like , ` Ooh , is that person talking about me ? ' ''
Common shot a video for the song during a visit to Haiti , which features the Windy City rapper driving through the streets of the country .
When the visual was premiered on Ustream , fans were required to make a $ 1 donation to watch the footage .
The funds went toward the J/P Haitian Relief Organization .
