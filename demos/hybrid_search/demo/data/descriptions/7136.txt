Weezer guitarist Brian Bell : `` I think this was a song that I fought for at Rick Rubin 's house .
And everything sounds so good at Rick Rubin 's house , because he has this uber-sound-system , and it just was apparent that we had to do it .
And I thought it was just an unbelievably sincere message that Rivers was conveying - I do n't know if he knew the weight of what he was saying .
It was really great .
it 's a personal lyric but it 's extremely universal because it 's hard to say ` I 'm sorry ' in any sense , it 's hard to admit fault , and I just think it 's a song for all guys that do n't know how to express themselves , so that they can at least sing that lyric to whoever they harm - their girlfriend , or whatever . ''
