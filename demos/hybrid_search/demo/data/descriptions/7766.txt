Shontelle told Singersroom.com that this reggae influenced track is about the poverty back home in Barbados .
She explained : `` I woke up in the middle of the night , it was 2 a.m. and that song was in my head .
It was really bothering me .
So I called a friend of mine who is a producer and begged them to open up the -LSB- Black Chineyso -RSB- studio so I can come over .
The song is really just about all the poverty and stuff that I see being in that environment .
It felt like every time I turn on the TV it was a lot of violence and depression , so I felt it was necessary to write songs like that to motivate and encourage people to overcome all these things . ''
