This song was inspired by frontman Jonathan Higgs ' gym experiences and a regular feature in Heat magazine .
`` It 's pictures of some dude with his top off , '' he winced to NME .
`` The objectification of that guy 's stomach ... -LRB- The song is -RRB- me thinking about how I 'll never be Torso Of The Week and the pressure is on people reading these sorts of things . ''
When Higgs goes to the gym , he finds his mind wandering as he rides his exercise bike .
He recalled to The Line Of Best Fit that one day , `` I was listening to Scott 's Journey to the Antarctic and just looking at these people like zombies on their treadmills .
I was thinking how weird it is that in this day and age we come into a room to use our bodies .
You have to set time aside to use your body .
It got me thinking of the balance of work-life and the lure of the bright lights and some kind of story in my mind of a woman who is struggling to stay on top of things with all the stuff she has to deal with .
A treadmill woman just going and going and going .
It struck me as a sad struggle in some way . ''
