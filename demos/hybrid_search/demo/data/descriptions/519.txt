Wilson created a metaphor on this heart-aching ballad , comparing being without his lady to being homeless .
The singer spent some time living on the streets in the mid 1990s and Wilson explained on his website , that he was forced to face his own recollections of that experience : `` I had hit rock bottom from my drug use so the idea of holding up signs on the street and food tasting like trash hits home for me .
While recording this song , I started feeling a lot of those old emotions . ''
