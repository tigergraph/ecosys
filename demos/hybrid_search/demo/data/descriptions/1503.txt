This was the first single from The Shins ' third album Wincing the Night Away .
The song was released as a digital download in November 2006 with physical copies available for fans to order the following week .
In an interview with Billboard , The Shins ' lead singer James Mercer described this song as `` a hypothetical , fictional account of a young lesbian couple in high school dealing with the s -- tty small town they live in . ''
The video for this song features The Shins and children acting out dramatizations of the stories of Joan of Arc , the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , and the Donner Party .
The Japanese version of Wincing the Night Away featured two additional songs : `` Nothing At All '' and `` Split Needles . ''
Both tunes also appeared on the `` Phantom Limb '' single .
The title does not appear in the lyrics to this song .
A `` phantom limb '' is a sensation that your arm or leg is still there even when it has been amputated .
It makes a great metaphor for odd disconnect .
The Shins ' Wincing the Night Away album was recorded in singer James Mercer 's basement with additional production done by Phil Ek in Seattle and Joe Chiccarelli in Oregon City .
