This song is a Folk standard .
Led Zeppelin thought it was a traditional song , meaning no one could claim they wrote it , but they later found out it was written by an American Folk singer named Anne Bredon .
She was not credited for the Led Zeppelin version until 1990 , when her son brought it to the attention of the band .
This was also recorded by Marianne Faithfull .
Jimmy Page played on her version when he was a session musician .
At the 1:43 mark , you can hear a recording of Plant saying , `` I can hear it calling me '' just before he sings the line - as if he `` hears it calling him . ''
-LRB- thanks , Andrew - Brisbane , Australia -RRB- Asked what kind of acoustic guitar he used on this song , Jimmy Page explained to Guitar Player magazine in 1977 : `` That was a Gibson J-200 , which was n't mine ; I borrowed it .
It was a beautiful guitar , really great .
I 've never found a guitar of that quality anywhere since .
I could play so easily on it , get a really thick sound ; it had heavy-gauge strings on it , but it just did n't seem to feel like it . ''
Jimmy Page got the idea to cover this after hearing Joan Beaz ' Folk version .
He and Plant were both fans of Baez .
In his 2012 Rolling Stone interview , Jimmy Page cited this song as one that showed the empathy he and Robert Plant had when working together .
`` I knew exactly how that was going to shape up , '' he said .
`` I set the mood with the acoustic guitar and that flamenco-like section .
But Robert embraced it .
He came up with an incredible , plaintive vocal . ''
Led Zeppelin only played this live on their 1969 tour , but Jimmy Page and Robert Plant brought it back for their 1998 tour in a 9-minute version .
-LRB- thanks , Chris - Whitesboro , NY -RRB- Page recorded a version with Steve Winwood in 1968 that was never released .
