Grant told American Songwriter magazine that he is especially proud of this song , `` because I felt like I was able to express what vulnerability felt/feels like for me and it was not really an easy thing to do .
I always feel very triumphant when I feel I 've expressed myself exactly the way I wanted to or needed to . ''
