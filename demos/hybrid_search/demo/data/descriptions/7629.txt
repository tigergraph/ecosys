Shortly after the Foo Fighters moved out to Hollywood , Dave Grohl wrote this song about his negative opinions of the area .
Grohl on the song , `` I wrote ` Stacked Actors ' about everything that is fake and everything that is plastic and glamorous and unreal , so if that pertains to anyone that comes to mind then there you go .
It 's about having nothing better to do than trying to be other people , it really grossed me out .
Actors , just in general make me f -- king sick . ''
-LRB- quote courtesy : www.fooarchive.com -RRB- Many believe this song , as well as `` I 'll Stick Around '' and several other Foo songs , are inspired by Courtney Love , widow of Grohl 's friend and former bandmate Kurt Cobain , since the lyrics appear that they could be about how bad Courtney was for Kurt , and how she may be responsible for his death .
