This seven and a half minute confessional finds a weary hedonistic Cohen owning up to sins and searching for redemption .
`` Tell me again when the angels are panting and scratching at the door to get in , '' he intones .
Cohen is Jewish , and he has drawn from Jewish religious and cultural imagery throughout his career most famously on `` Hallelujah . ''
The singer-poet has also been involved with Buddhism since the 1970s , and in 1994 he retreated to the Mt. Baldy Zen Center near Los Angeles , beginning what became five years of seclusion at the center .
Cohen was ordained a Rinzi Zen Buddhist monk in 1996 , but is still an observant Jew who keeps the Sabbath , refusing to give concerts on Friday nights .
Cohen recorded an early version of this track back in 2007 .
