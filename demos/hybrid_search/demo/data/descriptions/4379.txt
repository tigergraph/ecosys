American punksters The Offspring close their ninth studio album , Days Go By with this black comedy cut .
Vocalist Dexter Holland explained to Spinner that the idea of this song , `` is the world 's going to hell so let 's have a drink and watch it burn . ''
This follows `` Dividing By Zero '' and Days Go By 's final two tracks intentionally sound like one song .
Holland explained to Spinner : `` Those were actually the last two we did for this record .
We thought it would be cool to put two short songs together almost as if it were a short punk medley that adds up to one five minute song . ''
The song title references the actor Slim Pickens ' and his role in Dr. Strangelove as the B-52 pilot Major T.J. `` King '' Kong .
The movie 's most famous scene has Pickens on top of a dropped H-bomb , waving his cowboy hat as he rides to his certain death .
Said guitarist Noodles to Spinner : `` The Slim Pickens reference adds a comedic tone to the song .
That movie was hilarious , but it was very dark too .
That 's what this song is .
It 's a nihilistic thing , but at the same time we 're making fun of the nihilists .
It 's not bad for 2 minutes and 50 seconds . ''
