The phrase `` chant down Babylon '' originated in Jamaica , and has been described as the ultimate goal of Rastafarianism .
The use of the word Babylon has been traced to the Black Separatist Marcus Garvey , who drew an analogy with the Biblical exile of the Jews to Babylon and that of Blacks in the West with particular reference to the West Indies and slavery .
Garvey founded the Pan-African Movement , whose flag was inspired by the song `` Every Race Has A Flag But The Coon '' , something Bob Marley probably did n't know and would surely have forgotten if he had .
This track from the 1983 Confrontation album is far from the most inspired song he ever recorded , but is fairly easy on the ear .
