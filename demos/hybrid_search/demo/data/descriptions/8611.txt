This is about child abuse and how a person seeks to heal themselves after being abused when young .
Similarly , the lyrics deal with a person breaking the chain of hatred/abuse and not mistreating their own loved ones the way they themselves were mistreated - the whole ` Sins of the father passed down to the son ' idea - Can you break away from the malice ?
Will you be like the father who hurt you , or will you be your own man and make things right ?
James Hetfield goes a long way in comparing voodoo ritual concepts to the idea of breaking away from the hatred and pain that one may be exposed to .
