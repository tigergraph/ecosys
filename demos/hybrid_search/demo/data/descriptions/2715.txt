This song is about Steve Gaines .
His sister , Cassie Gaines , was a back-up singer in Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1975 .
Both died in the plane crash on October 20 , 1977 that also killed lead singer Ronnie Van Zant .
Cassie Gaines kept telling the band that they should give her brother Steve a chance to play .
They finally decided to let him play during one show .
The band told the sound people that if Steve did n't sound good enough to just turn him off .
The sound people never turned him off and the band was very impressed .
A few days later , Steve Gaines was invited to join the band .
Steve Gaines is the only other member of Lynyrd Skynyrd -LRB- other than Ronnie Van Zant -RRB- to write lyrics and sing during a recording session .
Prior to playing with Lynyrd Skynyrd , Steve Gaines ' band was playing motels and lounge bars .
