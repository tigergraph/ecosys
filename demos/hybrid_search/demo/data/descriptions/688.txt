Ida Maria said of this song on her record company 's website : `` I hoped that song was going to be for the alternative kids while I wrote it .
I wanted to see how catchy I could make all the songs .
I had n't really grown up on anything but rock music , so I tried to see if I could do that . ''
Maria explained the song 's lyrics : `` It 's very much a shout-out to all those who objectify women .
I wanted to turn it around and make the male body an object .
I think I succeeded and I 'm very happy about this . ''
The track uses as its hook a sing-along nursery rhyme type tune .
Maria explained : `` I used the simplest kind of melody to get my message across , so that people would sing the words out loud , and then maybe discover the message later . ''
