Jackson wrote this after his eldest daughter , Mattie , left home for college .
He told Billboard magazine : `` If you listen to that song and knew anything about me , you 'd say , ` Oh , yeah , he wrote that about his daughter , ' but I try not to write songs that are so specific that they would n't apply to anybody .
It 's a typical story of a young person leaving home . ''
The Boot asked Jackson if being in a houseful of women , it was hard to relate to what Mattie was going through when she left home for the first time .
He replied : `` I 've had to live with women all my life .
I grew up with four older sisters , and I was the baby and the only boy .
Now I 'm in a house with four , plus a couple working around there , so I guess I grew up not thinking any different about being around women .
Maybe it gave me a little more understanding and perspective .
I ca n't say it did , but I wrote that after she went to college .
It 's kind of a tough time , not just for the parents , but I could see it in her eyes .
She was a very confident child and teenager , and I was n't worried about her going off .
I knew she 'd be fine , but you could still see ... like it said -LSB- in the song -RSB- ` you 're grown , but you 're not . '
I could see in her eyes that she was anxious to go and looking forward to it , but a little bit scared and tentative .
I guess all those images came out of watching that . ''
