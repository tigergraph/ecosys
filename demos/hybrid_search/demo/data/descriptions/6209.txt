This is a track from Euphoria , which is Latin singer Enrique Iglesias ' first bilingual album .
The song features Senegalese-American R&B singer-songwriter Akon , who also co-wrote the tune along with Iglesias , producer RedOne and Frankie Storm .
Iglesias confessed to Sigal Ratner-Arias of the Associated Press : `` It was one of the most difficult for me .
It is a song that I wrote with RedOne a few times because I was n't happy with the melody .
I did n't get it right until the third time ! ''
Akon entered the mix after he stopped by the studio to visit and asked if he could record vocals .
Iglesias told MTV News : `` The Akon thing was spontaneous .
He was like , ` Can I jump on -LSB- `` One Day at a Time '' -RSB- ? ' ''
