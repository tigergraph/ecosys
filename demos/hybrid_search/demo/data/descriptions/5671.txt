This Reggae song was written in response to the United States pressuring Jamaica to burn their herb fields and to help reduce the amount of marijuana being smuggled into the United States : `` We do n't trouble your banana , we do n't trouble your corn , we do n't trouble you pimento , we do n't trouble you at all . ''
