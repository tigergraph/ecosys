The first single from Kiss 's 20th studio album , Monster , is an autobiographical rocker , which according to founding member Paul Stanley is , `` a battle cry that encapsulates the entire record ... one way or another , we 're going to do it our way . ''
The song was released July 2 , 2012 internationally , and the following day in North America .
Co-founder Gene Simmons recalled to Billboard magazine : `` Paul came in with a guitar chordal pattern , and it was originally called something else .
Then a few days later he came back in and said , ` What do you think of ` Hell or Hallelujah ? '
and we all just sparked to it and went , ` Yeah , that 's right . ' ''
