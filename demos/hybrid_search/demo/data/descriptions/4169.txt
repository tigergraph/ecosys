Labrinth previously co-wrote and produced Tempah 's hit singles `` Pass Out , '' `` Frisky '' and `` Wonderman . ''
Labrinth explained the song 's meaning to MTV UK : `` For me , the track is about making an earthquake and having people look my way because of how much noise I 'm making .
Sometimes , the one that shouts the loudest is the one that gets heard so , earthquake is shouting as high as it can . ''
