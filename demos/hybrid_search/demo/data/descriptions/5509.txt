Much of the Arctic Monkeys ' third album , Humbug , was produced by Josh Homme .
Two years down the line , the Queens of the Stone Age vocalist crops on this Suck It and See track , singing backup .
Alex Turner told NME : `` He came down one night and did his very masculine falsetto that he manages to do somehow . ''
The Monkeys hail from High Green , a suburb of the English city of Sheffield and this track contains a small segment of a tribute to the band 's hometown .
Turner explained to NME : `` At the end you hear a little snippet of this song we were making up while we in the studio there called ` I 'm From High Green ' which is where we 're from .
It was summat we were singing quite a lot , the four of us , while we were there .
How does it go again ?
Oh yeah , so you 've got to do it in a sort of Chris Cornell-style vocal : ' I lost my accent/I live the dream/but I still like my ale/because I 'm from High Green . '
That sort of thing .
Look out for it , you get a little snip . ''
The song finds Turner singing , `` I 've been watching cowboy films on gloomy afternoons . ''
Another Suck It and See track , `` Black Treacle , '' also contains a lyrical reference to western movies .
The vocalist disclosed in interviews that he watched several westerns whilst recording the album .
