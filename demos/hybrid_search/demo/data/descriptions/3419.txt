Allen told the Observer Music Magazine December 2008 that this song about a female character who 's all washed up at 30 was n't intended to make her more elderly listeners depressed .
She explained : `` It 's more about girls that have n't figured out what they want to do with themselves .
Especially really pretty girls .
They can rely on their looks to an extent : people will pay for their dinners and drinks and they do n't really have to think .
And then suddenly it hits them that they 're not doing anything with their lives and it 's too late .
And , yes , it 's about a specific person .
Most of my songs start like that and then become more general . ''
