British/Iranian DJ and singer-songwriter Yasmin 's second single was produced by frequent Tinie Tempah collaborator Labrinth , and was released on May 8 , 2011 .
She told Ministry of Sound how the trip-hoppy track was written : `` It was the first song that I made where I really felt like I 'd found my own sound and who I wanted to be as an artist .
It 's a really important song in my career , it 's really important to me and it got a lot of people interested in me .
I made the track with Labrinth who 's a friend , I asked him for a studio session and we started at 1pm and it was a really long day !
We tried loads of ideas and nothing was working , then at about 9pm we started playing around with new drum sounds and then strumming some chords , I wrote the whole song to guitar . ''
Yasmin explained the song 's meaning : `` It 's about a mutual decision in any relationship that you sometimes have to make when you realise that no matter how much you want it to work , it 's not going to . ''
