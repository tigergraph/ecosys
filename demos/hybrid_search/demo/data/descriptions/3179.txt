The title track from The Killers ' fourth studio album is both the name of the band 's own studio and a nickname for their home state of Nevada , which joined the union during the battle-torn Civil War .
Frontman Brandon Flowers explained to The Independent on Sunday he used the title as both a credo to live by , and a creative spur .
`` I think of it as a call to arms , '' he said .
`` We have a lot of references like that -LSB- on the album -RSB- .
It 's like a positive kick in the ass .
It 's a wake-up call of sorts .
Whenever I was struggling for anything lyrically , it helped just to go to that phrase .
And it can apply to so much more than combat , and it 's definitely the thread through this whole record . ''
The song features the Las Vegas Master Singers .
Frontman Brandon Flowers recalled to the Spotify streaming site : `` We did a song for Tim Burton 's Dark Shadows movie , a track by The Raspberries called ` Go All The Way . '
It has these crazy vocal arrangement on the choruses and we would sit and listen to them over and over again trying to work out what the dude was doing .
So we took that idea and put it on the end of Battle Born . ''
