This song about the secrets of sustaining a relationship features Don Henley of The Eagles on backing vocals .
When Paisley penned the tune with Chris DuBois and Ashley Gorley , he thought it sounded like something the Eagles would have recorded so he enlisted Henley to sing on the track .
`` I ca n't think of many groups who are more of a country influence than the Eagles , '' Paisley told The Boot .
`` Don Henley has influenced our generation in a way that few country artists ever will , and this is a man who adores country music and understands it , so having him sing harmony and getting to pretend that I 'm one of the Eagles for a night was a thrill for me . ''
The song finds the narrator getting relationship advice from an uncle , and Paisley decided to name the guy after one of his wife 's uncles .
`` That song feels like an old country song to me , the country music advice song , '' he told The Boot .
`` The advice from an older , wiser person happens at least once an album for me .
It really does .
When I used an uncle in it I used Kim 's Uncle Bill .
I 'll never live that down .
He 's going to be ` wise Uncle Bill ' from now on . ''
