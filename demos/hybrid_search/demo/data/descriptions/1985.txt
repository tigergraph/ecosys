Nashville-based alternative rock band Mona comprises vocalist Nick Brown , drummer Vince Gard , bassist Zach Lindsey and guitarist Jordan Young .
The band channels of the sounds of the American South through modern rock 'n' roll , which along with their Pentecostal past , has led some critics to compare them to Kings of Leon .
Lyrically , this song is a lament about women who ca n't seem to find happiness .
`` I 'm always blown away by the decisions girls make , '' Brown explained to Spin magazine .
`` Why choose to be stuck in a situation that you 're miserable in ?
Why be with someone you do n't really love ?
Why settle ?
And then why choose to lie to yourself instead of go for something better ? ''
Brown 's vocals for this song were recorded in an intentionally low-fi manner to recall the Sun Records vibe of the '50s and '60s .
