This is the opening track of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish 's seventh album , Imaginaerum , which tells the story of an elderly composer called Tom .
He suffers from dementia and can recall practically nothing from his adult life , only remembering his youth .
The story follows Tom as lies on his deathbed and delves into his imagination as he reminisces about his memories while his daughter , Gem , tries to recover him .
The album was produced alongside a movie of the same name , which follows a similar storyline .
The Finnish word `` taikatalvi '' translates as `` magic winter '' and introduces the snow flake theme of the album .
It is also one of few Nightwish songs performed entirely in Finnish , -LRB- the others are `` Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan '' from Once , `` Lappi -LRB- Lapland -RRB- '' from Angels Fall First and the 2007 single release `` Er√§maan viimeinen . '' -RRB-
The band 's writer-in-chief Tuomas Holopainen explained to Metal Hammer magazine : `` Since we 're doing the movie thing , every song on this album is composed to a certain story , so that 's how it all sounded .
The movie needed an intro of winter landscapes and all that , and I wanted to give it an exotic touch of being in Finnish ! ''
