This was the first single to released from The Cribs ' fifth studio album , In the Belly of the Brazen Bull .
The record was recorded after the departure of Johnny Marr from the band in April 2011 and this song finds them returning to their sound prior to the arrival of the former Smiths guitarist .
`` A lot of people are going to go , ` Oh now Johnny -LSB- Marr -RSB- 's gone they 're back to being a punk band ' , '' said Ryan Jarman to NME .
`` Not that I think there 's anything wrong with that , but I know a lot of people thought the last record was solely down to Johnny 's contribution , which it absolutely was n't .
` Chi-Town ' and ` Come On Be A No-One ' are much more direct songs than anything we put out on the last one . ''
