Frontman Chino Moreno discussed this lament about spiritual isolation with Artist Direct .
Said Moreno : `` I love that one ; it jumps around a lot .
I was going to fix it so every verse told one cohesive story , but I decided that I really like it the way it is .
It 's really fragmented .
Pieces of information are in different places -- under the water and in the city .
It 's broad , and it feels really good .
It adapts to the overall vibe .
It has a night time feel to it as well .
We 've been playing it in rehearsal and I realized how much I like it now .
When I first wrote it , I thought , ` You could tell this is one of my songs .
It 's probably the most Team Sleep-esque song on the record . '
I did n't want it to be too self-indulgent right off the bat or for people to think , ` This is Chino just being Chino . '
Really it 's not ; everybody contributes on that song fairly equally .
I wrote the opening riff , but the song grew from everybody building on to that .
It 's more of a Deftones song than people might believe it is .
Playing the song in rehearsal , it sounds mighty .
For the simple fact that it does n't have any crush guitar , screaming or anything aggressive on it , ` Sextape ' sounds really big . ''
