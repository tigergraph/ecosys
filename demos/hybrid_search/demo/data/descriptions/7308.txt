In a 2001 Spin Online interview , Eddie Vedder said , `` The song ` Off He Goes ' is really about me being a s -- t friend .
I 'll show up and everything 's great and then all of the sudden I 'm outta there . ''
The B-side of the single was `` Dead Man , '' which was originally intended for the film Dead Man Walking , but was passed over in favor of Bruce Springsteen 's `` Dead Man Walkin ' . ''
