Stan Bush is an American singer-songwriter who is best known for this power ballad , which was prominently featured in the 1986 animated film The Transformers : The Movie .
Bush originally penned it for the Sylvester Stallone movie Cobra , however his record label ended up getting the song in Transformers .
He told Total Sci-Fi : `` I remember initially thinking it was just some cartoon movie , but little did I know it would become such a phenomenon . ''
The track appeared on a 2008 episode of NBC 's Chuck , `` Chuck Versus Tom Sawyer , '' during a video game competition to save the world .
It also showed up in a 2013 episode of The Goldbergs .
The song also featured in the 1997 film Boogie Nights in a scene where Mark Wahlberg 's character Dirk Diggler performs the song in an attempt to get his music career going .
Unfortunately , Diggler turns out to be a comically bad singer and his musical ambitions come to an end .
In real life , Wahlberg had a very successful music career as the rapper Marky Mark .
Bush recorded an updated version subtitled `` Sam 's Theme , '' for possible inclusion in the 2009 sequel Revenge of the Fallen .
However to the singer 's disappointment it was n't included .
He told Total Sci-Fi : `` It was a bit of a bummer that ` The Touch ' was n't in the live action film .
It was going to be , but a couple weeks before the movie came out , Michael Bay pulled the song .
I never really found out why .
A lot of fans were disappointed as well . ''
