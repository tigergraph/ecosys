This is about a guy who snorts lines of crystal meth on a road atlas : `` I do lines and I crossed roads , I crossed the lines of all the great state roads . ''
He says he 's `` going '' to whichever state the atlas is opened to : `` I 'm going to Colorado , to unload my head ... I 'm going to Arizona , sex on the rocks all warm and red and we bled . ''
