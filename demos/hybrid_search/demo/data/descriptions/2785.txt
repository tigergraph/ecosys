This anthem call finds Marcus Mumford singing : `` I 'm a cad but I 'm not a I 'm not a fraud .
I set out to serve the Lord . ''
Speaking to the Big Issue , Mumford responded to the interviewer 's question about the seeming religious undertones to the lyrics .
`` The lyric you said , ' I set out to serve the Lord , ' no-one realizes it 's pluperfect tense , '' he said .
`` The lyric is , ' I had set out to serve the Lord . '
It 's looking back at a time when that happened . ''
`` I do n't even call myself a Christian , '' he added .
`` Spirituality is the word we engage with more .
We 're fans of faith , no religion .
We 're just writing songs that ask questions .
Sometimes the best way to go about exploring a question , things we would n't necessarily talk about in conversation , is by writing a song . ''
The Jim Canty directed music video was filmed during Mumford & Sons tour stop in Camden , New Jersey as we see each band member make their way to their arena show .
The tongue-in-cheek clip action is split into four screens , with Marcus Mumford cruising to the gig on a bike and Ben Lovett waking up in a parked car then finding himself in bumper-to-bumper traffic , meaning he has to race the rest of the way on foot .
Meanwhile , Ted Dwane looks contemplatively at the sea before hitching a ride aboard a naval vessel and Winston Marshall steps out of a suit into a ragged costume with the addition of some fake facial hair to complete the Depression-era look the band is often noted for .
Mumford & Son 's tour openers , Haim , have a cameo role helping to outfit Marshall in his tattered ensemble .
The song has been played live by the band since before their debut album Sigh No More was released .
