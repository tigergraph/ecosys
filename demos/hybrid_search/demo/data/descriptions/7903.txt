This mid-tempo tune is the first single to be released by Green Day from their trilogy of albums titled ¡ Uno !
, ¡ Dos !
and ¡ Tré ! .
`` The first one is power pop , '' frontman Billie Joe Armstrong explained to Rolling Stone of their three long players .
`` The second is more garage-y , Nuggets-type rock .
And the third is supposed to be epic .
With the first album you 're getting in the mood to party .
On the second one , you 're at the party .
And the third album you 're cleaning up the mess . ''
The song deals with matters of the heart and sexual tension . ''
` Oh Love ' is kind of like leading with your heart and not necessarily with your brain as much , '' Armstrong told MTV News .
`` And -LSB- also -RSB- kind of maybe losing your mind , and shooting a little bit more from the crotch area . ''
The song was recorded in Jingletown Studios , Oakland , California and released digitally July 16 , 2012 , the same date that it impacted radio .
It is the final track on ¡ Uno ! .
`` What I really wanted to do was write real power-pop kind of music that had that old Green Day energy , '' explained Armstrong to Billboard magazine , `` so the original Green Day sound became ' ¡ Uno ! ' ''
