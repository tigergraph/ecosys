This song was inspired by Country outlaw Waylon Jennings , a good friend of James Hetfield .
Waylon told James the story of when he was on vacation in Jamaica .
Waylon was in a bar when one of the local Jamaicans just kept staring at him .
This started to make Waylon very angry because this guy would not stop staring at him .
Latter he found out that the Jamaican was high and had no idea he was staring , meaning Waylon was angry for no reason .
He was wasting his hate on the Jamaican .
