Duffy in The Sun February 29 , 2008 : `` I wrote that with Bernard -LRB- Butler -RRB- on the same day as ` Serious . '
It was right at the end of the day and we were winding down .
We 'd had a load of fun and thought , ` Let 's just see what we can come up with . '
I remember wanting to write something with a social context .
I was realizing that the urgency of the city did n't allow for people to spend enough time with each other .
Maybe I 'd seen something on the news that afternoon.I love Wales .
It 's my home .
I equally love London .
It 's got this buzz about it - so exciting and so much choice .
Everything 's on your doorstep .
But maybe I was feeling the slower pace of Wales in that song . ''
