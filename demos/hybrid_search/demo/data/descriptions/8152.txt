The Sugaring Season album title is a reference to the time of year when maple trees are tapped for syrup .
Beth Orton came across the phrase whilst spending time in her husband 's home state of Vermont .
She explained to The Observer that she used it as a metaphor for extracting sweetness out of situations .
`` It takes a lot of sap to make a little bit of syrup , '' said Orton .
`` But what makes the flow are these long , cold nights alternating with those ever so slightly warmer days -- beauty and melancholy mixed together -- and after that , that 's when the sweetness comes . ''
All the songs on Sugaring Season , including this one are based in nature .
Orton told Jam !
Music : `` I do spend a lot of my spare time in nature , and I did spend a lot of time in Vermont .
But also , a lot of it was written dead in the centre of the London .
The song ` Last Leaves of Autumn ` was written at the top of Pentonville Road , which leads into King 's Cross .
It 's a very urban area .
But I always had a great longing for nature , even in the city .
I love trees .
