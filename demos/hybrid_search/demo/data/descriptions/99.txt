This is a positive , life-affirming song about changing one 's life for the better .
It was written by Brian Wilson and `` Reggie Dunbar '' - a pseudonym for Brian , Dennis and Carl 's father , Murry Wilson .
It is the only Beach Boys single that Brian Wilson ever created with his Dad .
However the contributions Murry Wilson made to the record are not known .
This song features Carl Wilson with the help of Mike Love singing the verses and Al Jardine singing the chorus .
In the summer of 1969 , Brian Wilson was coaxed out of semi-retirement to write the Beach Boys a hit song .
It was to be their last record for Capitol before they switched record companies and signed with Warner Brother 's Reprise label .
However , in the US it failed as a single due to Capitol 's lack of promotion .
