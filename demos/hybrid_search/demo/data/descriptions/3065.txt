Ben Drew , aka Plan B , grew up in Forest Gate , northeast London , and was raised by his mother after his punk musician father left her when he was five months old .
This song tells the story of his mum 's relationship with a crack addict .
Speaking with The Independent September 29 , 2012 , Drew said he does n't regret putting it out , because `` at the time it was the only way to change the situation . ''
He added : `` It was a piece of art that I 'd created over a torment she 'd put me through , not just through that period with that person , but throughout my whole childhood , with my stepfather as well . ''
The song samples Hall & Oates ' 1982 hit , `` I Ca n't Go for That -LRB- No Can Do -RRB- . ''
