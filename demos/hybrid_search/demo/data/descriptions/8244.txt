A number of songs on Little Honey were inspired by Williams ' relationship with her husband Tom Overby .
However the singer-songwriter explained to Rolling Stone that this love song was n't one of them even though she sings it to him now .
Said Williams : `` I got that song out of that fling before I met Tom .
I mean , a lot of the guys I 've been with , if they 're rock & roll musicians , there ends up being a little competition - they feel threatened .
But rather than feeling threatened by my strength , Tom is inspired by it , because he 's a real man .
He gives me confidence , and confidence is everything . ''
