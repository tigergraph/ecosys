This was originally recorded for the band 's 2005 album The Invisible Invasion , which was produced by Geoff Barrow and Ade Utley of Portishead .
However it was n't included on the final released version .
Frontman James Skelly wrote on his record label 's website about the song : `` We were recording The Invisible Invasion , and this was the first track we did with producers Geoff Barrow and Ade Utley , we went to their studio in Bristol and just knocked this one down and Geoff mixed it , and I think this is the monitor mix .
We were so in tune , we all chipped in on the writing , it started out as a kind of Beefheart tune .
We usually all arrange a tune but with this one we all wrote it together too , we did it all as one thing .
You have to be fully functioning as a unit to be able to work that way .
We came up with the title in a taxi somewhere , we were laughing at it , and just wrote a tune around it . ''
