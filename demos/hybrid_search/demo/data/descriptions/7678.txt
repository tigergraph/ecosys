He explained to MTV News : `` It 's a gift that God has given me that I thank him for a on a day-to-day basis .
I think it 's so important for me to open myself up to this country and put my pain on records .
People use my words of encouragement for therapy , and I feel like on this particular record , I just opened up my whole life .
To match the visuals with it , it 's probably one of the most jumped-on viewed videos of my career .
This record is s a no-brainer record .
It 's a personal record and it 's reality situations in my life right now .
I was in Atlanta and I got the call from my mom - she was crying - that my grandmother 's heart had stopped .
That 's the person I was talking about in the song . ''
