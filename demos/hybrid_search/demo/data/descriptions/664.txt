This was one of the last tracks the band laid down for Suck It and See .
Turner told NME : `` It were all about having the words not get in the way of this one .
That were one of the last ones we did when we were in London before Christmas .
We did it in one day .
It 's a bit like ' 505 ' -- that tune on the second album , where it 's just two chords all the way through and we 'd wanted to do a tune like that again for a while .
There 's loads of good examples of that like that LCD Soundsystem ` All My Friends ' tune.It 's just the two chords that build and build .
But for a while I did n't have words for that -- I was just singing ` Edge and Bono . '
There 's a demo of it somewhere where it 's mostly ` Edge and Bono . '
I dunno what else to say about that one .
It were a bit of a late runner that one but it worked out . ''
The song finds Turner singing : `` She looks as if she 's blowing a kiss at me and suddenly the sky is a scissor ... '' Most of Suck It and See was written in the fourth-floor New York flat , Turner shared at the time with his girlfriend Alexa Chung .
He told Q magazine : `` There 's quite a bit of sky in there .
Maybe cos I was writing at that angle I was on the fourth floor , I guess it 's the first time I 've not written on the ground floor . ''
