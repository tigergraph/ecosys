This is based on an open letter Young wrote to friends and fans in April 2008 .
It begins , `` No one song can change the world .
But that does n't mean it 's time to stop singing . ''
The letter goes on to describe Young joining the ongoing search for `` the people 's fuel , '' and that he knows `` the secret is just within reach . ''
The lyrics invite listeners to `` drive in my car , '' a reference to the LincVolt project in which a hydroelectric engine was installed in a 1959 Lincoln Continental .
The enormous car was used to symbolize Americans ' love for huge vehicles , and to demonstrate that we do n't have to give up driving big cars if an affordable clean fuel is found .
Young and his project committee describe their ideas and accomplishments at lincvolt.force.com .
-LRB- thanks , Ekristheh - Halath , for all above -RRB- For about a year before its release on Fork in the Road in April 2009 , this was recorded by fans at Young 's concerts and circulated on websites and in digital form , apparently with Young 's tacit approval .
When Young debuted the song live on August 7 in Helsinki , Finland , he introduced it as `` Just Singing A Song Wo n't Change the World '' , rather than the shortened , final title used on the album .
