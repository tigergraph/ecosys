On this Stargate-produced track Nas raps about sexism and racism in the US and how the world views American citizens .
Nas told MTV News : `` When Americans want their independence and they celebrate it , they know what 's still going down .
We ca n't forget it .
America still got a lot of growing up to do .
America has so much great potential .
You know , I love this country , but at the same time , we have to fix up a lot of things .
And it 's just a reminder . ''
