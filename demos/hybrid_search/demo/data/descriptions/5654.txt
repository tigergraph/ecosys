Gallows vocalist Frank Carter -LRB- from Kerrang !
April 18 , 2009 -RRB- : `` This is a very short and succinct story .
We all end up in the ground .
It does n't matter who you are , what you are fighting for , what you want out of life , whoever you are - you will end up six feet under .
We all go the same way , under the sod . ''
This song features Biffy Clyro singer Simon Neil .
