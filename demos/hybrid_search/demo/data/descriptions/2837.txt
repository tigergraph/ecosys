Eddie Vedder recorded this acoustic serenade to his two daughters for Every Mother Counts , a benefit compilation record put together by the model Christy Turlington .
The album was recorded to raise funds for the campaign of the same name , which was founded by the supermodel to increase education and support for maternal mortality reduction globally .
Christy Turlington told Rolling Stone : `` Eddie was amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much .
I spoke to him and exchanged several emails about his contribution .
` Skipping ' is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start .
He once wrote me saying that his girls would be proud one day that their dad contributed to such a meaningful project . ''
That 's Vedder 's oldest daughter Olivia chirping `` check , check '' and `` Daddy '' at the beginning of the song .
She was born June 11 , 2004 to the Pearl Jam frontman 's now wife , Jill McCormick .
