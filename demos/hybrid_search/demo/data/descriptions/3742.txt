Hayley Williams told MTV News that this song came from a period of deep introspection and its subject matter helped frame the entire Paramore album .
`` The title came first , which never happens , but I just thought , I liked the term ` Anklebiters , ' when you 're talking about kids or babies , '' she said .
Brewer 's Dictionary of Modern Phrase & Fable defines an ankle-biter as , `` a jocular but altogether friendly term for a small child , reflecting the anarchic violence of which such diminutive persons have been deemed capable . ''
The term was first recorded in 1963 in America .
The song was given a Pac-Man inspired animated video created by Jordan Bruner .
Hayley Williams explained that the band felt the need to create a visual for the tune .
`` We just thought we 'd like to release something for that song cause it 's become pretty special to us after the last tour , '' she tweeted .
The song addresses people who ca n't think for themselves .
Williams told Spin magazine : `` To me there was this thread throughout the album of wanting to be able to grow up and move forward .
And when you do that in your life , there 's always people that are going to try to hold you back .
Or they 're going to try to tell you , ` You do n't need to do this , because this is the right way to go . '
Or you do n't need to grow up , because this or that .
And it 's about those people , and it 's about not listening to that but listening to your heart , and what do you want out of life ?
Who do you want to be ?
Versus all this outside influence that I think we get so caught up in , especially in the age of the Internet and all the different opinions that we hear so loudly every day . ''
Williams explained to Kerrang !
Magazine the song is about , `` embracing who you are , your differences and quirks .
`` Some people wan na pull you down and say you 're wrong , '' she continued .
`` But you keep fighting and say , ` No , this is who I am . ' ''
