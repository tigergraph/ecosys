Johnson : `` That one 's about people pushing their religions on each other .
I actually started writing it when I was in New York doing Saturday Night Live .
I picked up the newspaper and on the cover was that horrible thing that happened in Fallujah where they killed those Americans and dragged their bodies through the city .
The cover of the newspaper had a photo of their burned bodies , and it was a horrible image .
I came up with just the line , ' I heard this old story before , where the people keep on killing for their metaphors . '
Joseph Campbell is a writer that I like a lot .
He talked about how there 's all these different metaphors and different ways of believing in what 's unexplainable and people are always getting into conflicts over it .
The idea for the song is just about tolerance and not pushing your religion on each other . ''
