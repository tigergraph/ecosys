It was n't until Gwen Stefani had a night to herself while visiting with husband Gavin Rossdale 's family in London , that she got enough inspiration to write this power ballad .
`` I really had n't emotionally felt like we could write a slower song , '' she told Billboard magazine : `` And we had written the chorus and a verse at Tony -LRB- Kanal , bassist -RRB- 's house , so I took it with me to work on while I was in London .
And I think I called you '' - she points to Kanal - `` and said , ' I think this song might be good , ' and then he finished this chorus .
It all happened so fast we were almost insecure about it . ''
