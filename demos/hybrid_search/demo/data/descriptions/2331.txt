Toby Keith penned this song with his his frequent collaborator , Bobby Pinson .
Keith recalled : `` I had the verse and chorus and sang them to Bobby one afternoon .
He took off on it immediately and we frolicked all the way through . ''
Keith explained why he sees this as a great song to open his concerts : `` It 's funny to say and I think it will work great live . '
I got stoned this morning , but I have n't had a drink all day . '
It 's like justifying your high .
It 's just a wild , hard-driving , hard-hitting live song -- what you want to come onstage with .
You want to walk on , lay that sucker out there and kind of say , ` I 'm setting the tone right here . ' ''
