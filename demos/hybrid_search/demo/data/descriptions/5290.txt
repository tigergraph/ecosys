This song was inspired by a chapter from Hubert Selby , Jr. 's 1964 controversial novel about the brutality of urban life , Last Exit to Brooklyn .
Lyrical allusions include `` Tralala , '' -LRB- the title character of a prostitute character in the book -RRB- and `` broom-shaped pleasure , '' -LRB- the chapter ends with a particularly gruesome gang rape of Tralala involving a broom -RRB- .
Newman explained to Secret Sound Shop why he chose such a shocking subject matter for the song : `` I always believe that you write about what moves you , '' he said , `` and although that gang-rape scene is horrible ... it really moved me , it 's really well written , you do n't really know which way is up after that chapter .
I thought it was a really powerful thing to write about . ''
Mentioned both in this song -LRB- `` Dead in the middle of the C-O-double M-O-N '' -RRB- and `` Bloodflood , '' The Common is a park in Southampton , the South England city where Newman grew up .
The song has been used in several TV series , including Weeds , Suits and Homeland .
The song title does not feature in the lyrics .
Speaking with Secret Sound Shop , frontman Joe Newman explained : `` Basically the phrase is ` in your snatch fits pleasure , broom shaped pleasure , ' '' he said , `` so fits and pleasure and Fitz like a second name , like Fitzpatrick so we thought Fitzpleasure , so more subtle . ''
Another link between Last Exit to Brooklyn and rock music is that The Smiths titled their 1986 album , The Queen Is Dead , after a different chapter in the novel .
The lyric , `` Dead in the middle of the C-O-double M-O-N '' was inspired by a line from Puerto-Rican/American rapper Big Punisher 's 1998 track `` Twinz , '' which goes : `` Dead in the middle of Little Italy .
Little did we know that we riddle some middlemen who did n't do diddle . ''
Newman explained to NME : `` There 's a gang in Southampton called The Mandela Boys .
We were scared s -- less of them when we were kids .
The -LRB- next -RRB- line , ` Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys soon become Mandela Men ' is me wondering whether they 're still in the gang or if they 've just all got jobs and kids now . ''
