Papa Roach close their eighth studio album , The Connection , with this electronic track .
Guitarist Jerry Hortom explained to Altsounds.com how the song 's vibe was inspired by Nine Inch Nails .
`` I was listening to all the songs we had , '' he said , `` and I was thinking that the record could really use something kind of dark but also vibey .
I had a Nine Inch Nails song in my head and that was sort of an inspiration for it - we wanted any new slow songs to be more vibe and less ballad .
And I love on that first Nine Inch Nails record there was that one song that sort of put you in a trance , but the vocals were really close and very personal and that was the sort of the vibe I imagined for the beginning of it .
After I made it I consulted Tobin -LRB- Esperance , bassist & programmer -RRB- and played it for Jacoby -LRB- Shaddix , vocalist -RRB- , '' Shaddix continued .
`` and he liked it , but we were working on other stuff and then it came a time towards the end of the cycle and I said , ` Let 's not let this one get away . '
So I gave it to Tobin and he added his flavour , or as we say , ` Put his stank on it . '
Later we gave it to Jacoby and he came up with the perfect lyrics to sum the vibe up in that song .
The way I imagined that song visually was that it was like in a movie where somebody is in this huge brawl and then it 's sunrise and they are walking down a road or whatever . ''
