Frontman Brad Arnold explained the song 's meaning to Artist Direct : `` The song talks about realizing that you 've done wrong and getting back to where you should be .
The hook of the song is , ' I did n't have to die to go to heaven ; I just had to go home . '
It 's also looking back with regret about taking so long to realize those things .
There are a lot of different themes on there , but it 's a really fun record to listen to . ''
