This was the first single to be taken from Biffy Clyro 's sixth album , Opposites .
It received its exclusive first play on Zane Lowe 's BBC Radio 1 show on November 19 , 2012 and was released on January 14 , 2013 .
Simon Neil 's wife had a couple of miscarriages and their personal troubles put a huge strain on their marriage , nearly tearing them apart .
In this `` twisted love song '' he sings , `` You left my heart like an abandoned car .
Old and worn I 'm no use at all . ''
The singer explained to NME : `` That 's where the bitterness came from .
But there 's also a strength that came out of wanting to fix that . ''
Lyrically , the song oozes emotional anguish .
Vocalist and lyricist Simon Neil told The Sun : `` It 's almost an anti-love song .
It 's about being with someone you need to survive .
But sometimes you feel as though you do n't necessarily want to survive .
It 's kind of a downbeat look at love and what it demands of you as a person . ''
Neil told NME : `` It 's got quite a lot of space for a song by us and it 's one of the simpler songs on the record , but from the first time we played it live it felt right .
Sometimes you 've just got to trust your instinct . ''
