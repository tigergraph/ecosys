This song appears to have been influenced by the experimental German Krautrock movement of the late 1960s and early '70s .
In an interview with Drowned in Sound , the interviewer asked Jez Williams -LRB- guitarist -RRB- and his brother Andy -LRB- drums -RRB- if the band had been listened to old Krautrock records when they wrote this song .
Andy replied : `` Krautrock is definitely something that we all agree on , and have been fans of for a long time .
I 'd say Kraftwerk as well .
Man Machine is one of those records that I keep going back to over and over again since I can remember . ''
The Doves told the NME April 11 , 2009 : `` We 've always been mad into film scores , so we wanted to do a sci-fi-feeling tune and this fits the bill .
Lyrically it 's this Blade Runner-ish thing and you can hear bits of Kraftwerk .
This song includes some unusual instrumentation .
The Doves told NME : `` We bought a machine from a Russian factory on eBay that used to make bullets for the metallic sound .
It looks like military hardware . ''
Andy Williams told The Quietus , that this song `` started life as a more rocky song and it was later on that we added those 16s on the hi-hats and it showed us a different pattern . ''
Frontman Jimi Goodwin added : `` Then we added a phase to it .
Then we added the chugga chugga chugga bassline which was really staccato . ''
Jez Williams , rather than the band 's principal vocalist , Jimi Goodwin , sang this song .
The band generally test all three voices before deciding which one best suits the songs , and in the case of this tune , they plumped for Jez 's subtle vocals .
