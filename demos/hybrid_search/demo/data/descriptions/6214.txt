This brutal , raging number is the opening track from Buffalo , New York metalcore band Every Time I Die 's sixth album Ex Lives .
Joe Baressi , who 's also worked with Queens of the Stone Age and Coheed and Cambria , produced the record .
Buckley trawled the Web for the footage of immolation and mutilation that the video contains .
`` The Internet is a weird place , '' he told Kerrang !
magazine .
`` I did n't like what the video did to my mood .
It 's like walking in on your parents having sex !
Things are never the same again .
But I knew I wanted to be potent and upsetting and it does that . ''
The word `` bimbo '' is derived from the Italian for `` baby . ''
It was first used in the 1920s as a derogatory term for either sex before gaining its present meaning of a superficially attractive but essentially shallow young woman in the 1980s .
A video was filmed for the song directed by the band 's vocalist and lyricist Keith Buckley .
He explained : `` In order to write lyrics I had to pay attention to the defeatism that the music suggested .
To compile this video I had to acknowledge the masochism I wrote of to myself .
You do n't get rewarded for your faith and you do n't get celebrated for your heroism .
Just when you find yourself attached , you have lost it .
Everything is borrowed .
C'est la vie . ''
The photograph used for the Ex-Lives album cover was originally brought to the attention of Keith Buckley through a fan of the band on Twitter .
