McEntire explained to Great American Country : `` It 's a song about a woman who found out that her husband left on Saturday for a woman who is half her age .
She spent the day lying in bed , but then on Monday got up , loaded up her pickup truck and began a new chapter of her life .
She went on with her life and did n't look back . ''
This is the only track on Keep on Loving You that McEntire has a songwriting credit for .
She told Great American Country : `` I wrote the first two lines of ` She 's Turning 50 Today ' and sent it to Liz Hengber .
I said , ` Why do n't you work on this a little bit and email me back what you 've got ? '
Two years went by , and I said , ` Liz , what about that song ? '
She said , ` Tommy Lee James and I are going to work on it .
So by the time this album came around to start recording , they sent me an MP3 of it while I was in the studio .
I rewrote the second verse to make it more personal and relate to me when I left Stringtown , Oklahoma , in 1987 .
So in a way it 's about me leaving a relationship , but it was certainly years ago , but put the two together . ''
