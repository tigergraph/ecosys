Frontman Josh Havens explained to Christian Music Today that the album 's underlying theme of transformation was not planned : `` We did n't intend for it to be a theme , but after finishing the record , we could see the idea of transformation throughout the entire album .
Several songs could be about not being content on where we are and striving for more , or taking the bad that comes in life and letting it be used for good - that God is ultimately in control and he can take the chaos and make it beautiful .
` Summer Again ' is a good example , dealing with several different issues of loss and changing seasons .
It could stand for your life as you look back and long for the glory of your youth , or it could be about coming to terms with where you are . ''
