Hesitation Marks was Nine Inch Nails first album since 2008 's The Slip and followed several years when frontman Trent Reznor had concentrated on film scoring and his other band How To Destroy Angels .
Spin magazine asked Reznor why he brought the band back to life .
`` The unglamorous story is that I owed Interscope a couple of songs for a greatest-hits package , '' he replied , bluntly .
`` I thought that might be a good excuse to try some new things , and ` Satellite ' and ` Everything ' came out .
It was obvious that I would have censored myself from doing things so minimal and pop in the past .
That made me think , ` Let 's keep chipping away at the crack in the ice .
We might fall through , but that prospect is exciting . ' ''
