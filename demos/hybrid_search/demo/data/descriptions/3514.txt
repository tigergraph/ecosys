This is a track from Story Of Your Life , the fourth full-length studio album by CCM artist Matthew West .
The singer/songwriter turned to his fans via web and radio for songwriting material for the album asking them to submit their stories of restoration , celebration , pain , hope and more .
Around ten thousand answered from across the world .
One of the hardest parts of writing the album was that fans submitted stories on topics that West did n't realize he might have to address .
Among them were tales of child abuse .
`` Writing about these things allowed me to see that I have a very narrow view of the world , and they allowed me to look beyond my sheltered life , '' he admitted to The Boot .
`` When I would read stories of sexual abuse of children , I first was shocked , then angry , and then I thought about my own children .
One of the songs I wrote about this topic was ` Broken Girl . '
I was doing a show in Seattle and my band told me they thought I should sing this song .
We had never sung it live before , but I did it .
A few days later , I received an email from a man who had been at that show with his daughter .
His letter said , ` You do n't have to write my life story ; you already did .
When you sang ` Broken Girl , ' that was about what I had done to an innocent girl , my daughter ... and I have spent many years trying to heal that wrong .
She was at the concert with me that night . '
Again I realized you just never know who you are reaching at your concerts . ''
