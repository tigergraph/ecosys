This anthemic cry to help right the social , environmental , economic and other wrongs of this world is a track from California rock act Buckcherry 's fifth album , All Night Long .
Founding guitarist Keith Nelson explained to FMQB : `` The song came about prior to that whole tragedy .
We just wanted to put together a song that kind of addresses some social concerns .
We 're not a big political or social band , but there 's a place for it in the music that we make .
So we did that song , and then the whole BP disaster happened and we had an opportunity to go back in and tweak a couple of the lyrics to make it more specific to that .
There is a lot of tragedy .
There are people affected by it , there 's a lot of wildlife that 's affected by it , and we just wanted to bring some attention to it .
We are trying to focus on helping the people that have been hurt by it . ''
The track was offered as free download on the band 's website , Buckcherry.com in aid of the victims of the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
Frontman Josh Todd commented , `` As musicians who have the benefit of the spotlight from time to time , we feel it is our duty to aid in raising awareness and financial support to help remedy the awful situation in the Gulf Of Mexico .
It is so important that each and every one of us do what we can to help those out whose lives have been harshly impacted by the oil spill . ''
Keith Nelson on how the song came together : `` I was hearing this drum pattern with a guitar riff that went with it , and Jimmy and I got together and did that chorus .
Then Josh put some really great lyrics together that were a little more socially conscious that we usually get .
He took that ball and ran with it . ''
