Many of the songs on Halcyon are based on Goulding 's break-up in late 2011 from her former partner , BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James .
She explained to The Mail On Sunday : `` My new album is about heartbreak .
Once I thought it would be less about those issues , but unfortunately it 's not .
I think girls will be able to relate to it .
I can fall in love in a simple way , but I can dissect it in such an intense fashion when it ends .
If it 's possible , I 'm way more honest on this album .
Although it 's positive and anthemic , there 's a doom-laden happiness to some of the album 's tracks .
One , ` Joy ' , has the lyric , ` I 've realised the joy is not in your arms , I know I 'll always ache with an empty heart . '
Sometimes I 'd look at the lyrics I was coming up with and realise that I had all this sadness inside me . ''
