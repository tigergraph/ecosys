This song was written in protest of Ronald Reagan 's visit to Bitburg , Germany in 1986 .
This was used in the movie School of Rock in a scene where the kids learn how to use their instruments .
-LRB- thanks , Adam - South Pasadena , CA -RRB- The song was originally titled `` Bonzo Goes To Bitburg , '' since Reagan starred -LRB- alongside a chimp -RRB- in a movie called Bedtime For Bonzo .
Johnny Ramone , a staunch Republican and Reagan supporter , insisted the title be changed to the song 's refrain .
-LRB- thanks , Katie - NSW , Australia , for above 2 -RRB-
