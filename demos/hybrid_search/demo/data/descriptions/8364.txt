This is the first single from southern rapper Chamillionaire 's third studio album , Venom .

`` This is probably my last tribute to them , '' he said .
`` For now on , man , I ` mma think positive and focus on my grind , and I 'm not gon na worry about y' all no more .
The song , the feeling of it , makes you wan na get outta bed and go get some money . ''
The song was Chamillionaire 's first hit on the Hot 100 as a lead artist since he topped the list over three years previously with `` Ridin . ''
Chamillionaire told MTV News that he did n't spend much money on the music video .
`` You still got ta find a way to become creative , '' he said . ''
-LSB- Director Don Tyler -RSB- found a way to add the graphics in there and be creative .
-LSB- The video -RSB- is basically showing me going through what people do in a week 's time , in a morning .
It 's almost an exaggerated look at somebody living an entertainer 's life .
I wake up , I got a closet with nothing but the best shoes , I got two women in the bed , the baddest car .
I 'm shooting a commercial , I 'm shooting a club scene in a video .
I do a talk show .
I do everything you can accomplish in a week 's time , in a day .
-LSB- The video -RSB- is subliminally saying , ` We 're not worried about what haters are saying . ' ''
