Bradley Gilbert penned this heartbreaking song with Bonnie Baker about a girl he knew at school .
He recalled to KNUE 101.5 FM : `` That song took me longer to write than any song I 've ever written .
I wrote it about a friend of mine from high school .
Her name was not Amy , but her boyfriend had proposed to her and actually got in a car accident and died on the way home that night .
And then about six months later I was still working on it , but I changed the title to ` Saving Amy , ' I did n't want to put her name in it , and I played it for my cousin who had just come back from Iraq and he started tearing up , and I was like ` Dude , what is it ? '
He said , ` Number one , that 's a sad song , but I 've been waiting for somebody to write a song about Joseph for a long time . '
And it clicked .
I did n't know it , but a friend of mine , Joseph Hensley , proposed to a girl named Amy one night , and on his way home he was actually hit by a train and the only thing that was untouched in the whole entire accident was his Bible .
So it turned out to be a pretty strong song , and I felt like I had a little bit of help writing that one . ''
