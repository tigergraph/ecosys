This was the third single from the LP with the same title .
It was the band 's third single to hit the UK charts but unlike their previous two releases , it failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100 .
It 's about a man looking back on his life with gratitude and saying that if he could go back in time , he would n't change anything that had happened to him , even though there were bad times as well as good .
`` Turn back the clock '' is a phrase meaning to return to the past or to a previous way of doing things .
Probably the best known song about wishing to go back in time to change something is R Kelly 's single ; `` If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time , '' in which the narrator regrets letting a girl slip away as he did her wrong .
-LRB- `` If I could turn , turn back the hands of time .
Then my darlin ' you 'd still be mine . '' -RRB-
Kim Wilde did background vocals on this single .
She was briefly engaged to Johnny Hates Jazz drummer Calvin Hayes and was hot at the time having topped the US charts in 1987 with her cover of the Supremes ' `` You Keep Me Hangin ' On . ''
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA , for above 2 -RRB-
