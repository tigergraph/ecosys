This sunny pop ode about leaving one-night stands behind for a more rock solid relationship was originally written for the band 's breakout album , Some Nights , but was ultimately left off as the chorus featured an uncleared sample .
Nate Reuss , Fun .
's lead singer , told Rolling Stone the trio dejectedly put it away until Lena Dunham , the creator of the HBO series , Girls asked them to contribute a song for the show .
He said : `` I ended up rewriting the chorus and actually like it better than the sample now !
We recorded most of this in Italy on a day off from tour and I just remember us eating an Italian feast at the studio and barely being able to communicate with the engineers , which was kind of cool because it eliminated all small talk and put the focus into the song . ''
