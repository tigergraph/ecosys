Alex Day became the first unsigned artist to land in the top five of the UK singles chart when this song debuted at # 4 on Christmas Day 2011 .
The singer had already accumulated a huge fan base by means of the videos he posts online on a regular basis on his popular YouTube channel nerimon .
11 alternate versions of the song were recorded by Day , with the sales from these `` remixes '' going to World Vision , a charity for whom the singer volunteered in Zambia .
Day is also a founder of the band Chameleon Circuit , whose music is inspired by the sci-fi television series Doctor Who .
One of his bandmates , fellow YouTube celebrity Charlie McDonnell , directed this song 's music video .
The clip is a Zombie spoof , and Day explained to The Evening Standard , `` the theme of the song is friendship , so we just wanted to pay homage to the kind of silly videos you might make when you were young with your mates . ''
Day wrote the song on his acoustic guitar , He explained on his website that it 's , `` about accepting that all you will be with someone is friends and that being enough .
So , yeah it 's about girls , but a bit more mature . ''
This was n't Alex Day 's first foray into the UK Top 40 .
Back in 2009 , four YouTube video producers were challenged to write , record and release a pop song in ten weeks , using YouTube as a source for lyrics and singers .
Their efforts were recorded on the BBC 2 reality show , Chartjackers and Day was one of the featured YouTube artists .
A Chartjackers single `` I 've Got Nothing , '' was released , which peaked at # 36 in November 2009 .
After debuting at # 4 , the song was withdrawn by Day at the start of the following week resulting in it vanishing from the entire published Top 100 chart .
This was the biggest ever drop out of the tally , overtaking the Chemical Brothers Looks Of Fury EP , which plummeted out of the chart after spending its first week at # 13 in January 1996 .
