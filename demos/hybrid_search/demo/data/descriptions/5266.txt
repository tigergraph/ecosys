This is the first single to be taken from American alternative metal band 10 Years ' third major label studio album , Feeding The Wolves .
The song was first played on Sirius/XM Radio on June 12 , 2010 , and was made available to download on iTunes July 6 .
The album title is taken from a line in the song , which singer Jesse Hasek told The Pulse of Radio is about the pressures the band has faced in the music business .
`` It 's a very aggressive song and it 's a little bit of angst towards just how they do n't leave you alone to be the musicians you are , '' he explained .
`` You hear it with a lot of bands , the whole ` jaded ' scenario , but it 's true , because we 're a bunch of musicians that were writing music all on our own with no outside sources affecting us .
And then you get , it turns into a profession and you get pulled in all sorts of directions .
And we just said , ` Enough 's enough , we 're just gon na do what we want . ' ''
