The band 's drummer , Andy Burrows said of the origins of this song in the London Times , July 14 , 2006 : `` We were in a hotel in Ohio - and Johnny -LRB- Borrell , the band 's frontman -RRB- wo n't like me telling you this because he wants it all to be ` Ooh , it just came from the stars ' - but this Billy Joel record came on .
And he said : ` Why have n't we got a song with a drumbeat like this ? '
So I said : ` You can have one if you like . ' ''
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England -RRB-
