Paul McCartney explained to Rolling Stone magazine that he came to this song as well as all the other songs in the album , `` with absolutely no concept of what the melody or lyrics would be about . ''
He added : `` So it was like writing on the spot , which I think lent an electricity to the whole sound .
It 's kind of what happens when you write a song ... but on speed .
You 've just got to think of the idea there and then : `` First thought , best thought , '' as Allen Ginsberg said .
Instead of spending the next two hours molding it , I would just step up to the mike and go -LSB- singing -RSB- ` Ooohhhawowahhasingthechanges , ' like throwing paint at the wall , and then you just stand back and take a look at it and see whether some of it looks good . ''
