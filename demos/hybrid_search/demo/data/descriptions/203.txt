This is the title track to American Alternative Rock band Safetysuit 's second album .
It finds the band 's vocalist Doug Brown singing of the struggles people face and how their difficulties will pass .
`` We were really excited about it when we were finished because we knew that this song is exactly what we wanted to say and how we wanted it to sound , '' said Brown .
`` We 're not really a soapbox band .
We 're not going to get up there an preach to everybody too often , but we felt like we needed to speak to everyone in the country and around the world and say times are tough for people .
When you 're struggling with your family , your health , or your job , or whatever it is , people are having a rough go of it right now , so we just wanted to write something that basically says that these times are a hard , but they will pass .
Try to have a glimmer of hope that they can hold onto . ''
The band invited some of their fans to share some of the trials going through for the song 's music video .
The clip begins with them holding up signs with an ordeal they 've faced written on them .
As the song progresses , the fans turn their signs over and show the other side with `` They will pass '' written on them .
The mostly acoustic song was penned at the end of the songwriting process for the album .
`` We recorded our entire record and we thought we were done , '' said Brown , `` and we listened through it and felt like something was missing , and we ended up writing , These Times . ''
