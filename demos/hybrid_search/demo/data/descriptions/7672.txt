Vanity is a female singer who was a member of Prince 's entourage .
She formed Vanity 6 with her two friends and recorded the album with backing from The Time , who was another Minneapolis group who worked with Prince .
Although he does n't have any official credit for the song , it sounds a lot like what Prince was doing at the time , with extremely sexual lyrics and smooth Funk beats .
The group broke up after this album , but the two members who were not Vanity -LRB- Brenda and Susan -RRB- hooked up with Apollonia , who was another one-named Prince protégé , and formed The Apollonia 6 in 1984 .
Vanity eventually became a born-again Christian , and renounced the highly sexual nature of her early work .
