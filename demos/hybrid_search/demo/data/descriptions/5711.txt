This was the opening track of American progressive metal band Dream Theater 's tenth studio album , Black Clouds & Silver Linings .
It 's 16-minutes long , which explains the `` Progressive '' in Dream Theater 's `` Progressive Metal '' label .
The album contains just 6 songs , and it covers some pretty heavy stuff .
Their drummer Mike Portnoy told us : `` Because there was only 6 songs , because the lengths were very long , it meant that there were only going to be 6 subject matters .
Normally if we have more songs on the album , we 're able to cover more lyrical ground .
But with only six songs , inevitably the topics are heavy . ''
Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucci wrote the lyrics for this song about a near-death car accident that he was involved in as a child .
Portnoy told us that it 's a true story , `` Something that happened to John when he was a kid . ''
