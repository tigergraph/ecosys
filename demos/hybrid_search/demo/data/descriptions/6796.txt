This is the lead single of Scottish singer Susan Boyle 's second album , The Gift .
The song was written and originally recorded by New York rock singer-songwriter Lou Reed .
Reed directed the song 's music video as a way of showing support for Boyle after the America 's Got Talent controversy .
It is a journey through stunning natural settings of the Scottish singer 's homeland .
The singer told the Sunday Mail : `` I loved that Lou understood how much it meant to me to film in Scotland .
I did n't mind how much it rained or blew a gale - I enjoyed every minute .
`` It was Reed who called Boyle to offer his services .
He told the Sunday Mail : `` I wanted to create a beautiful and intimate piece shot in Susan 's native Scotland and she quickly agreed . ''
Boyle was scheduled to perform the song on an episode of America 's Got Talent , but permission was withheld , leaving the Scottish singer in tears .
At first it was believed that Reed himself had vetoed the performance , but it was later claimed that a `` licensing glitch '' was to blame , and Reed knew nothing of the decision .
The Gift topped both the American and British album charts .
This meant that Boyle became the first woman , and only other artist besides the Beatles and the Monkees , to land two straight # 1 albums within a calendar year in both the UK and the US .
