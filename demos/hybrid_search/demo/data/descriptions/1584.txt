After the onslaught of the first four tracks on True Defiance , this song finds Demon Hunter chilling out just a tad .
Said frontman Ryan Clark to Alternative Press : `` I like albums with peaks and valleys .
I get bored with records that sit in a singular dynamic from start to finish , which is why we 've always incorporated songs like this on our records .
It allows us to explore an entirely different set of emotions and a varying musical style at the same time .
There 's still a dark , heavy quality to it , but it comes as a welcome calm from the preceding brutality . ''
Clark on Patrick Judge 's guitar work for this track : `` I love the opening lead that Patrick wrote .
It 's got that epic 80s hair metal vibe without being too obnoxious .
Every time I hear it , I picture Patrick playing it standing on top of a grand piano with a giant fan blowing his hair back .
I absolutely love the guitar solo in the bridge of this song as well . ''
Clark admitted some people might get confused about the song 's meaning .
He explained to Alternative Press : `` I have to admit I like to play with words that sound like they 're saying something but actually mean another , which is definitely the case with the chorus on this song .
` If tomorrow never comes for all the cold and bitter ones , we can breathe . '
At first glimpse , it seem like I 'm saying ` if the cold and bitter people would just die , we could breathe easy , ' but what I 'm actually referring to is someone whose life is in a downward spiral - and the hope that whatever ill fate dwells around the corner , never comes for them . ''
