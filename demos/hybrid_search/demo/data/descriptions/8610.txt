Kid Rock 's guitarist Marlon Young is a friend of Lynyrd Skynyrd .
He came up with the original idea for this song and sent it to the band .
Said Gary Rossington to Classic Rock magazine : `` We co-wrote some of the lyrics , and they were a little different of what he had in mind , but he liked it .
It really reminded us of an old type Skynyrd song , or an old Rossington Collins Band song .
It was just kind of us , so we jumped on it . ''
