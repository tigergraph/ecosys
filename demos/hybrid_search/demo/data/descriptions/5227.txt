This was the first song written for The Eternal .
Guitarist Thurston Moore told Billboard magazine that it was inspired by the Oregon punk rock group , The Wipers .
He explained : `` When I started writing , I was immersed in listening to the Wipers . . ''
` No Way , ' the first song we recorded , has a total Wipers vibe , if the Wipers were a No Wave band . ''
The band described this in publicity materials as `` a confrontation with the devil in his guise of temptation and staking a distinct place amongst the black legions . ''
