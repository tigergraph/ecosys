This surrender to a broken heart was penned by Nash after splitting from The Cribs ' Ryan Jarman .
She told Spin magazine : `` It 's about not being able to get better .
It 's about being pained .
One thing that loads of people said to me last year , and I wanted to punch them in the face every time , was , ` It 'll just get better with time .
It 'll heal in time . '
And all you want to say is , ` F -- k off .
No it wo n't . '
Now , I feel like I would never say that to someone if they just went through a breakup , but , in a way , it 's something you have to say , because it 's true .
But when you 're in that space , you do n't want it to be , because if you had something like that , something that you believed in , you do n't want it to just disappear . ''
