Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake perform on this with Timbaland .
Furtado duetted with Timbaland on her 2006 hit single `` Promiscuous , '' making this track something of a favor returned .
He has also produced a number of tracks for her , including `` Promiscuous , '' `` Maneater , '' `` All Good Things -LRB- Come To An End -RRB- '' and `` Say It Right . ''
For Justin Timberlake , he produced `` SexyBack , '' `` My Love '' and `` What Goes Around . ''
On the same day that MTV premiered the music video for this song , Scott Storch responded by releasing `` Built Like Dat , '' featuring the Latino rapper Nox , which makes various accusations against Timbaland .
The single is a dig at several unnamed music stars .
Timbaland has confirmed in an interview with MTV that fellow producer Scott Storch , with whom he co-wrote Timberlake 's 2002 single `` Cry Me A River , '' is the target of his verse .
Though the production of `` Cry Me a River '' is credited solely to Timbaland , Storch has claimed that he was responsible for producing it.There are contradictory reports that Justin Timberlake 's target is either Janet Jackson or Prince , while Nelly Furtado has denied in interviews that her verse is about Fergie despite many reports to the contrary .
Furtado expressed regret about contributing to this track in a December 2010 interview with The Metro : `` I wish Justin , Timbaland and I had n't put out that dis song Give It To Me , '' she said .
`` It was like the first ever pop dis song -- a genre usually reserved for rap .
We put a lot of negative energy out into the world . ''
