This is the title track of American Alternative Country collective Lambchop 's 11th album .
The LP was originally titled `` Mr. Met '' after the New York baseball team 's ball-headed humanoid mascot , but was changed to Mr. M at the insistence of lawyers .
Frontman Kurt Wagner explained to Mojo magazine : `` I was playing with the past participle idea of the word ` met , ' making it a sort of subtle reference .
But for me personally , the baseball mascot Mr. Met is something some friends that I 'm close with share a fondness for , so it 's kind of an open letter to my friends - which is the way I approach music anyway .
Unfortunately when our new record company was aware of the title , they tried to get permission to use the name and could n't . ''
Wagner explained the song 's meaning to UK newspaper The Sun : `` I like to think of it as a guide book or maybe a little self-help primer based on certain personal events , '' he said .
