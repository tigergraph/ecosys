This is the fourth single from American Country artist Kellie Pickler 's self-titled second album .
Karyn Rochelle , James T. Slater , and Shane Stevens wrote the song .
The song nearly did n't make it onto her album .
`` This was the last song that we recorded for the album , '' she explained .
`` It just barely made it .
We were ready to send it off to be mastered and to get it ready to be packaged for the shelves , but it just made it barely .
I was actually surprised how it did make it on there .
I 'm glad it did ... It completed the record . ''
In this song the female narrator describes the euphoria of being in love .
Pickler told The Boot : '' ` Makin ' Me Fall In Love Again ' is a reflection of where I am with my life right now .
I 'm very excited about it being the fourth single .
It 's such a great song for the springtime and summertime .
It 's just so happy and warm .
I think it was a good pick , especially since the last song -LSB- ` Did n't You Know How Much I Loved You ' -RSB- was a ballad and more of a break-up song . ''
