The band spent time at a farm in Buffalo , Texas owned by one of guitarist Eric Pulido 's childhood friends .
Frontman Tim Smith told Pitchfork whilst they were there , `` We got into British folk .
We started listening to Fairport Convention , Steeleye Span , and Pentangle ; those are the three biggies .
Strawbs , Amazing Blondel , a lot of more obscure bands : Yellow Autumn , Windy Corner .
A lot of Pentangle .
I had never listened to that stuff before . ''
The Buffalo trip sparked this song .
The song is built around a couplet by German Playwright , Poet , Novelist and Dramatist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe -LRB- 1749-1832 -RRB- - `` Into the core of nature/No earthly mind can enter . ''
`` I do n't know much about Goethe , I just had a book of his poems from the library , '' Smith admitted to The Independent February 5 , 2010 .
`` A lot of times , I 'll use poetry to start coming up with a melody , because I do n't write the lyrics first , I always start with the music and then see what sounds right coming out of my mouth .
Certain words suit my voice better than others , and those words can then create the germ of an idea for a song .
But I ca n't come up with it out of thin air , so a lot of times , to come up with an idea for a melody , I 'll sit at the piano or guitar with a book of poetry and start singing the words , then I 'll go back and replace them with my own lines .
But that line was just so great , I realised I was never going to top that . ''
