This was expected to be the first single from the Courtney Love-fronted Alternative Rock band Hole 's fourth album , Nobody 's Daughter , and was performed by the band on a number of TV shows to promote the record .
Eventually `` Skinny Little Bitch '' was chosen as the lead single .
Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan assumed the role of guitar player on most of the songs on Nobody 's Daughter and penned the main riff for `` Samantha . ''
However for the final recording of this track , Love replaced Corgan 's guitar part with a cello .
Love told Q magazine : `` The cello that you hear is a really hot Chinese girl with an amazing rack and insanely good hair who is a heavy metal goddess on cello , Tina Guo . ''
This was co-written by Linda Perry who produced and co-wrote much of Courtney Love 's 2004 solo debut album , America 's Sweetheart .
The song was originally recorded at the end of the Perry sessions , its sound inspiring the direction of the album .
