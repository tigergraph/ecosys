The song is a sarcastic swipe at those who believe the Pet Shop Boys are finished .
The lyrics are drawn from conversations with taxi drivers .
`` Oh you 're him from the Pet Shop Boys are n't you ? ''
singer Neil Tennant mimiced to The Guardian .
`` I suppose you 're more or less retired now .
It 's quite a journalistic thing as well .
The early stuff is always the holy grail : the pure years before money and fame . ''
