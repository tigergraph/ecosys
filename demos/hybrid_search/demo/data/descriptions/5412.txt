This is a track from WYWH , the fourth studio album by Swedish indie pop band , The Concretes .
The title is an acronym for `` Wish You Were Here . ''
Milberg was asked in the same interview how she creates a track .
She replied : `` That depends on the track .
Some I just find lying around in my mouth , others I have to lure out like you do with a cat ; pretend you do n't care and wait for it to come to you and snuggle up against your legs .
Others still I have to take serious action to finish .
I find myself doing things in my life I probably would n't have done if it was n't for the sake of the chorus . ''
Lead vocalist and drummer Lisa Milberg explained to CMU that this song is a tribute to a track by American rock band My Morning Jacket .
Said Milberg : `` I think Jim James from My Morning Jacket is a genius .
He sings like an angel and is constantly pushing himself in new musical directions .
Sometimes too far -LRB- listen to Highly Suspicious -RRB- but that 's the beauty of it .
Our song ` Good Evening ' is an ode to their song ` Touch Me I 'm Going To Scream Part Two ' .
Sexual frustration bottled up in disco .
So that 's a pretty straightforward influence right there . ''
