This piano-led ballad tells the tragic tale of a female friend of Green 's heroin addiction .
The rapper explained to Digital Spy why he is especially proud of this track : `` It 's about a real situation and touches upon some issues that are not easily digestible , but it 's a beautiful song .
On first listen it does n't sound about something as dark as it is , which probably makes it my favourite song on the album . ''
