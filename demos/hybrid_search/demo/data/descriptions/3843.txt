A Camp are made up of Cardigans frontwoman Nina Persson , her fellow Swede Niclas Frisk who is the guitarist and composer with Atomic Swing , and Persson 's soundtrack composer husband Nathan Larson .
The Colonia album is , according to Larson in an interview with The Daily Telegraph , `` an exploration of colonialism , as the title implies . ''
This song is about Persson 's adoptive Manhattan .
Persson expanded to The Independent newspaper on The Colonia : `` I was inspired by the history of savagery .
The human urge to rape , conquer and pillage has always fascinated me , and lyrically it makes for some terrific metaphors that can work in all sorts of ways , both personal and political . ''
