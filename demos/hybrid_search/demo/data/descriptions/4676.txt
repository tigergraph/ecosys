This version of the Robert Wilkins ' 1930s blues number is from British guitarist/singer/songwriter Eric Clapton 's self-titled 19th studio album .
Clapton revealed to Mojo magazine that he has always hated the sound of his singing voice , and it took this collaboration with Cale to re-inspire his confidence .
Said the British guitar legend : `` I hate my singing .
It all sounds like I 'm 16 years old from Surbiton .
When I watch Ray Charles sing I think , ` That 's it , that 's how it 's done ' .
He remembers thousands of songs and he sings them all as if they 're the most important songs he knows .
`` Clapton added : `` When I started singing it JJ started to repeat the line .
I thought , ` What 's he doing ? '
I thought he 'd sing with me -- but this was JJ putting the New Orleans thing into it , and it was perfect .
I learned from JJ that it 's okay if I sing very quietly .
That 's almost like not having to try to sing .
You can have Ray Charles who can do all kinds of things with his voice .
Then you 've got JJ at the other end of the spectrum -- he creates exactly the same amount of emotional capacity in a very minimal way .
So there are different ways to do it . ''
The Rolling Stones did a cover version of `` Prodigal Son '' for their 1968 Beggar 's Banquet album .
It is also thought that Led Zeppelin 's Poor Tom was influenced by Wilkins ' tune .
The song is one of four collaborations with JJ Cale on the record .
Their friendship started after Cale penned two of Eric Clapton 's career-defining solo hits , `` Cocaine '' and `` After Midnight . ''
Robert Wilkins later deserted secular music and became a minister in the Church of God in Christ .
He began playing gospel music with a blues feel and changed `` That 's No Way 's ` unholy ' words to a biblical theme re-titling it , `` The Prodigal Son . ''
