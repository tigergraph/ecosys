Frontman Brendon Urie told VH1 : `` What happened was one night when we were writing another song , we took an hour break .
I was playing something on the guitar and as we were all hanging around I was making up lyrics to it .
It just kind of became a ditty and the rest of them - I think they 're all crazy - but they were like ` You can throw that on the album . '
That was one of the two songs I got to throw on there . ''
