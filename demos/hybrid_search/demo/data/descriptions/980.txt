This was written by Ruthann Friedman , who was singer/songwriter that was part of the San Francisco and Los Angeles music scene in the '60s .
She became friends with Beach Boys lyricist Van Dyke Parks , who introduced her to The Association , who were the first to record the song .
They turned `` Windy '' into a girl .
Originally , this was written in waltz time .
Association guitarists Larry Ramos and Russ Giguere shared lead vocals on this song .
It was n't easy - the session started in early afternoon and ended at 6:30 the next morning -LRB- they had to catch an 8:30 a.m. flight to perform in Virginia -RRB- .
Their voices were so burned out that Howe had everybody in the studio singing on the ending of the song .
This is a rare hit song with a recorder solo .
It comes in about 1:07 into the song .
Hal Blaine was brought in to play drums on this song .
Blaine has played on songs by Simon And Garfunkel , Frank Sinatra , The Beach Boys and many others .
Although Friedman wo n't reveal the identity of `` Windy , '' but she tells us that he was another singer/songwriter , and not `` a freewheeling Haight Ashbury Hippy '' as often reported .
Friedman says of the song : `` I have heard so many different permutations of what the song was about .
Here is the TRUTH .
I was sitting on my bed - the apartment on the first floor of David Crosby 's house in Beverly Glenn - and there was a fellow who came to visit and was sitting there staring at me as if he was going to suck the life out of me .
So I started to fantasize about what kind of a guy I would like to be with , and that was Windy - a guy -LRB- fantasy -RRB- .
The song took about 20 minutes to write . ''

After `` Windy '' 's run at # 1 on the Hot 100 , `` Never My Love '' almost matched the feat in late 1967 , peaking at # 2 on the singles chart -LRB- it did hit # 1 on `` Cashbox '' -RRB- .
`` Never My Love '' was composed by Don and Dick Addrisi , The Addrisi Brothers of `` We 've Got to Get It On '' and `` Slow Dancin ' Do n't Turn Me On '' fame .
This was The Association 's second # 1 hit .
Their first was `` Cherish , '' recorded the previous year .
