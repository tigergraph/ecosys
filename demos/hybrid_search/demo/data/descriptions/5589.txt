This is the opening track from American R&B singer Amerie 's fourth studio album , In Love & War .
One producer who instantly understood what Amerie needed was Teddy Riley , who produced this track .
She said , `` I did n't really have to say much to Teddy .
I told him I wanted something signature ` me . '
He knew exactly what to do .
It was like magic .
I wrote that record freestyling in the vocal booth after hearing it for the first time .
Killer . ''
Amerie explained in publicity materials that she mapped out the sound of In Love & War before she sat with any producers .
She explained : `` The process would usually be quite a few steps .
Usually I 'd get a raw instrumental , and from there I 'd pick out parts and sounds , and then format them to create the arrangement of the song .
Once I wrote and vocalised it , I 'd talk to the producer again about adding additional instrumentation I felt was necessary , like strings , additional keys , building the bridge , just basically formatting the record . ''
