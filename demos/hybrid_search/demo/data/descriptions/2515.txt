Akon , T.I. and Snoop Dogg all contribute vocals to this tune .
Drama told MTV News : `` It 's a big song .
Three international superstars , so we definitely had to make it major .
It 's about when you might see a young lady and you get some thoughts in your head or some visions or some dreams . ''
Akon elaborated : `` It 's pretty much about being enticed by a go-go dancer .
There 's always that one -LSB- you see in the club -RSB- that makes you be like , ` Why is she in here ?
I wan na take care of that one . '
So it 's that vision of what that is right there . ''
