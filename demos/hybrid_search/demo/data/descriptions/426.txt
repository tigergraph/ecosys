Singer and guitarist Dan Auerbach told American Songwriter magazine that he roped in three `` local girls '' to sing the gospel harmonies on this track about the illusionary nature of material success .
Directed by Harmony Korine , the mastermind behind the cult movies Gummo and Kids , and shot on raggedy VHS tape , the song 's music video turns the Black Keys duo into babies , strapped to giant versions of themselves .
The song was used as the musical backdrop for the 2012 NCAA March Madness tournament during its transmission by the TBS , CBS , TNT and truTV networks .
The Black Keys went to legal war against the advertising agency representing Pizza Hut for ripping off this song in a TV commercial for the American restaurant chain 's Cheesy Bites Pizza .
The lawsuit is part of a trend , which finds artists crying foul over advertisers using tracks that sound very similar to their music .
