This is the closing bonus track on The Next Day Extra , an expanded three-disc collector 's edition of Bowie 's first studio album in 10 years , The Next Day .
Producer Tony Visconti commented to NME : `` I am far from the best interpreter of Bowie lyrics , but I 'll stick my neck out one more time .
` So She ' is a wistfully sung love song .
It kind of makes me feel romantically sad .
Harmonically it is quite sophisticated for such a short piece . ''
