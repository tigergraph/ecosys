The second single off American band Daughtry 's third album Break The Spell is a continuation of the raw rock sound that his fans are familiar with .
`` Going into the writing sessions -LRB- for ` Spell ' -RRB- , we said , ` Let 's not try to sound like anything .
Let 's just write and see what happens ' , '' said Chris Daughtry .
`` We came up with some pretty interesting tunes that sound nothing like anything we 've done before .
At the same time , ` Crawling Back to You ' is a song that will appeal to fans who have been with us from the start . ''
The song 's music video is a simple one of the band performing the song .
Talking about the clip , Chris Daughtry said , `` We wanted it to be a performance video not necessarily based on any narrative or story . ''
The singer added , regarding his philosophy of filming visuals : `` Whenever I do a video I have a hard time faking it .
I always lose my voice at the end of a video shoot because I give it all every single take . ''
Chris Daughtry explained that the song 's message is : `` Your significant other is in the right , and just like she said it would happen , you come crawling back . ''
Chris Daughtry had this song in his back pocket for a few years , but there was something not quite right about it .
`` It did n't make Leave This Town , and a lot of times , after being away from the songs for a good amount of time , you either go back and go , ` OK , there 's a reason that did n't make the record ; it 's junk , ' or you go , ` Man , there 's something really cool about that song , but it 's not quite there yet , ' '' he told MTV News .
`` And the more we listened to it , the more we were like , ` Man , it gets to that moment , and then it 's a letdown . '
So we realized the chorus was n't quite right , and when I was working with -LSB- producer -RSB- Marti -LSB- Frederiksen -RSB- again for this record , we went back to it , and he goes , ` Let 's try going here , man , ' and I came up with the melody and that was it . ''
