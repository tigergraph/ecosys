This was written by the Nashville songwriters Jim Collins and Marty Dodson .
Collins ' songwriting credits include Chesney 's `` She Thinks My Tractor 's Sexy '' and `` The Good Stuff . ''
Dodson 's credits include Billy Currington 's Country # 1 `` Must Be Doin ' Somethin' Right . ''
George Strait recorded this for his 2008 Troubadour album , but when he decided not to release it on the album , Chesney decided to record it instead .
Strait 's version is available as a digital download .
This was officially credited as Kenny Chesney featuring The Wailers and when this topped the Country chart Bob Marley 's former backing band became the first Reggae act to reach # 1 on this tally .
It was also the first time that an act from Jamaica reached the summit of the Country chart .
Chesney explained the song in its press release : `` Everything in that song is everything we all think .
I do n't know anyone who does n't want to go to heaven , but nobody wants to go today .
If you could pick , you would n't pick right now .
You 'd want to live , to do more things , to have more fun .
And that 's sort of the point of the song , too .
It 's one of those songs that says , ` I 'm not only not ready , I 've got a little bit more fun to have . '
It 's certainly the way me and the people around me try to live , to pack as much as we can into every day ... and it 's the way I think our fans are living .
You can tell when you get out in the parking lot , these are people who have come to have fun , to make a few memories with their friends , and I think that 's a great way to live . ''
This song is set to a calypso orchestration and features Bob Marley 's former backing band , The Wailers .
This was the second Hot 100 song that The Wailers appeared on , the previous one being Bob Marley 's `` Roots , Rock , Reggae '' back in 1976 .
The gap of 32 years between their first two Hot 100 debuts is the longest for an artist in the chart 's history .
