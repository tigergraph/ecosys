American Heavy Metal band Mastodon took a fortnight off from their touring schedule to record a score for the comic book movie Jonah Hex .
This is the opening track from the EP of the movie 's soundtrack .
The score for the Josh Brolin and Megan Fox starring movie was composed by Mastodon and film composer Marco Beltrami .
Mastodon bassist Troy Sanders told Paste magazine : '' -LSB- Director Jimmy Hayward -RSB- played scenes for us and gave us all day long to create music that matched the emotion of the scene .
It was flattering to be given 100 % creative control in this movie .
It was very pure , it was real creative and totally spur of the moment .
We wrote variations on themes for each character , different variables for a bunch of riffs : faster , slower , heavier , lighter .
It 's the Darth Vader approach .
Some of it was heavy , some of it was very moody .
A lot of it was spacey , Melvins B-sides , Pink Floyd-like , surreal outer space , like Neil Young 's Dead Man .
Swirling , nausea music . ''
