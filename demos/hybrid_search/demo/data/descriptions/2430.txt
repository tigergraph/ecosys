On this track singer Ezra Koenig Auto-Tunes his voice over a breezy , almost calypso vibe .
On using AutoTune in this song , Koenig commented : `` It does n't sound like T-Pain .
There 's plenty of amazing music from around the world using AutoTune besides American pop . ''
For a band synonymous with New York , it may come as a surprise that Vampire Weekend have `` gone Californian '' on this track .
Koenig explained to Mojo magazine November 2009 : `` When we say ` Californian , ' people might think of Jefferson Airplane or Black Flag , but for us , it means a group of people , an aesthetic and a vibe .
New York is essentially full of man-made things , but what makes California is the way people interact with the natural landscape .
It 's much more dramatic in a lot of ways than the East Coast and I think that has a deeper cultural resonance and affects the way people live . ''
