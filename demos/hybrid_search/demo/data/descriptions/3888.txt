McRae explained this song on his record label 's website : `` You have to have at least one river song if you 're a singer-songwriter .
It 's the law .
On this record there are two , so I 'm getting them out of the way now .
I like the possibility of a different life being just around the river bend , it could get better , or there could be a waterfall .
Either way you 're going to find out . ''
