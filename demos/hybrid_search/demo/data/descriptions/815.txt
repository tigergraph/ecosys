It seems that this person is trying to escape , or is afraid of death .
This is supported by the lyrics , `` Now I 'll break on tonight I 'll escape light , I 'll escape one tonight , gravitate slice slice '' and `` Desprate in death .
Death will tell them .
Death will kill them .
Death will tell . ''
