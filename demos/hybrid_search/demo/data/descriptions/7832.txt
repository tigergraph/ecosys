Chesney told CMT about this song : `` In the song , it talks about music being a demon .
It talks about women being a demon - which I confess , that might be mine .
And it talks about alcohol and drugs .
I know people that have one of those somewhere .
Or I know people that have got all of them at once .
Are you kidding me ?
-LRB- laughs -RRB- What am I talking about ?! But we do .
It 's how you deal with it and how you move on and how you choose to lead your life .
I think that 's what makes this song so powerful . ''
