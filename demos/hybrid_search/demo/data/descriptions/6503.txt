Southwest Georgia native Phillip Phillips attended Lee County High School in Leesburg before graduating from Albany Technical College with a major in Industrial Systems Technology .
Phillips auditioned in Savannah , Georgia for American Idol with a performance of Stevie Wonder 's `` Superstition . ''
He advanced to the final despite being taken to a doctor for possible kidney stones after the Top 13-performance night .
Phillips was declared the winner after a record breaking total vote count of 132 million in the finale on May 23 , 2012 .
The guitar-strumming southerner sang this rootsy ballad as his coronation song .
It was penned by songwriter Drew Pearson , who 's previously worked with American Idol alums Adam Lambert , Casey Abrams and Lee DeWyze and Scottish-born , English-raised singer Greg Holden .
It was originally intended for Holden , but was pitched to Jimmy Iovine as a possible finale song by Pearson 's publishing company , Pulse Recordings .
When asked by MTV News how he wound up choosing this for his debut single , Phillips admitted : `` It was n't really too much of a process .
I got to hear it once and they said , ` Would you like to do it ? ' ''
Phillips was the second American Idol alumni to achieve a top 10 hit with a song titled `` Home . ''
-LRB- Chris -RRB- Daughtry 's hit with the same name was his second single release after he came fourth in the competition .
The song received a profile boost during the London 2012 Olympics , thanks to its use as a theme during NBC 's broadcast of its women 's gymnastics coverage .
The resulting digital sales returned `` Home '' back to the Top 10 of the Hot 100 .
Having debuted at # 10 in June 2012 following Phillips ' victory on American Idol before dropping off the chart two weeks later , the song returned to the top 10 thanks to its use in the Olympics .
In doing so , it became the sixth recording ever to hit the top 10 in separate chart runs.The other five were : `` The Twist '' by Chubby Checker .
# 1 1960 and # 1 1962 .
`` Stand By Me '' by Ben E King .
# 4 1961 and # 9 1986 .
`` Monster Mash '' by Bobby `` Boris '' Pickett & the Cryptkickers .
# 1 1962 and # 10 1973 .
`` Bohemian Rhapsody '' by Queen .
# 9 1976 and # 2 1992 .
`` I Will Always Love You '' by Whitney Houston .
# 1 1992 and # 3 2012 .
Phillips ' victory over Jessica Sanchez meant all 11 victorious finalists were the ones listed second alphabetically by first name .
He was also the fifth male winner in a row .
Pearson told The Hollywood Reporter that its Mumford & Sons sound was no accident .
`` I do love Mumford , '' he admitted .
`` I also like Arcade Fire and there 's some of that , too , along with a few Irish bands that influenced it . ''
The song debuted at # 10 on the Hot 100 with 278,000 downloads sold according to Nielsen SoundScan .
It was the second-best digital sales week ever for any `` Idol '' contestant , beaten only by Kelly Clarkson 's `` My Life Would Suck Without You , '' which sold 280,000 downloads in its first week.It was also the biggest sales week for any `` Idol '' winner 's coronation single , overtaking David Cook 's `` The Time Of My Life , '' which debuted with 236,000 in 2008 .
It should be noted that both season two champion Ruben Studdard and runner-up Clay Aiken achieved higher debut week sales , but their numbers came through CDs .
Studdard 's coronation song `` Flying Without Wings '' moved 286,000 units whilst Aiken 's 2003 season-finale single `` This Is The Night '' shifted 393,000 discs .
Back in 1959 , a Louisiana singer-songwriter named Phil Phillips had a # 2 hit with `` Sea Of Love . ''
However in this instance , Phil Phillips was just his stage name .
He was born John Phillip Baptiste .
Phillips is seen traveling across the US and playing gigs in the song 's music video , which features his girlfriend Hannah Blackwell , who regularly joins the singer on tour .
Asked if he was wary of including his love interest in the clip , he told Access Hollywood : `` If girls like me 'cause I 'm cute , and they find out I have a girlfriend or something and they do n't like me then , it was n't about the music.I 'd rather be all about the music , '' he added .
I 'd rather not be successful being that way , than being cute and being successful . ''
The song is played after a Dramatic scene in the Clint Eastwood directed film about a retiring baseball scout and his daughter , Trouble with the Curve .
