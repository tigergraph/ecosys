Lead guitarist Will Nutter explained to The Alternative Press : `` I wrote this song for anyone out there who thinks he or she is n't good enough for the world 's standards - whether it be looks , personality or just fitting in .
The message is simple .
It 's about inner beauty and letting it shine . ''
