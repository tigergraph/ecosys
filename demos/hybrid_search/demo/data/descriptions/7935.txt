This ten minute song was the first track laid down by Palms for their eponymous debut album .
Chino Moreno explained to Artist Direct : `` We actually started with ` Mission Sunset ' because it 's the longest song .
I wanted to attack the hardest one .
It has the most parts in it .
I knew if I could do that song , it 'd all be downhill from there .
It would at least be easier to figure out .
We got that one out of the way first . ''
