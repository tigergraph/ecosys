Gallows vocalist Frank Carter told Kerrang !
magazine April 18 , 2009 : `` This song is about the kids , the next generation and taking the power back .
When a country goes into disrepair , as Britain has , the power goes back to the people .
The kids are the future and they have the most control .
Unfortunately , the generation gap is so small these days that it 's hard to teach your children what 's right or wrong , when you do n't have a very sharp understanding about life yourself . ''
