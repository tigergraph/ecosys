Red Light Fever is the second album by the Coattail Riders , the side-project of Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins .
The album features contributions from Foos frontman Dave Grohl .
The former Nirvana stickman did n't want to play the drums on the project , but lived up to his reputation as the nicest guy in rock .
Hawkins told Musicradar.com : `` Obviously Dave is one of the best drummers of all time -- but he 's also one of the best rhythm guitarists of all time .
He 's like the Pete Townsend of our generation .
He plays rhythm guitar on almost 90 % of the record .
If you really want to hear him , it 's in the last song , I Do n't Think I Trust You Any More -- that 's pure Dave .
He wrote that whole thing and basically gave me it as a gift .
I think at one time I did ask him to play drums on one song , and he said , ` Nope , I 'm not playing drums on your album . '
But I was a little selfish in the drum department , to be honest . ''
