This true-story sing-a-log with a country influence takes the Black Lip 's trashy aesthetic to literal new lows with a tale of rooting in bins .
Frontman Cole Alexander explained this ode to trash and his love of finding new treasures to Spin magazine : `` I 've had great fortune dumpster diving .
-LSB- Drummer -RSB- Joe Bradley was searching through some garbage once in Hawaii and found a lap steel guitar from the '40s or '50s .
It works perfect .
We 've been using it on the album.One time , after the September 11 attacks , we were dumpster diving and found five boxes of urinal pads -- you know , the ones in public toilets -- with stickers of Osama Bin Laden 's face on them .
We gave them away at shows .
But they were n't that well thought out .
When you peed the sticker stopped the hole in the toilet , so the pee would splash back on you .
It was almost like Osama Bin Laden was spraying piss at you from his mouth .
I love dumpster diving .
It 's one of my passions . ''
