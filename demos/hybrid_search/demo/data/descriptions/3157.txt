KROQ 106.7 Los Angeles reported that a long-lost high school romance was the inspiration for this moody track .
Frontman Tyler Glenn explained : `` I drifted back to being 17 with my high school girlfriend in her parents ' house when we were n't supposed to be in there because they were out of town .
And we were dancing , and we used to buy strobe lights from party city and we put 'em on and we were dancing - I forget what we were dancing to .
But basically that song was written about that time when me and her first started dating and realizing we were in love with each other .
So , that song is about that intimate , maybe , 90 minutes of my life . ''
Guitarist Chris Allen explained how he achieved the unconventional melodies that compliment Glenn 's emotional lyrics on the track .
`` I had a lot of fun experimenting with some tones on that one , '' he said .
`` I was determined to order these metal picks on line .
Well , first I searched every guitar shop in the L.A.-area .
I ended up trying an aluminium pick , and the tone just shows it .
You could n't get that sound with anything else . ''
