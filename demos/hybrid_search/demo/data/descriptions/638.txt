Pop/country singer-songwriter Jessie James co-wrote this song with Josh Kear -LRB- `` Before He Cheats '' -RRB- and Mark Irwin -LRB- Garth Brooks -RRB- .
James told SingerUniverse Magazine that this is her favorite song on her debut self-titled album .
She explained : `` I love that one , production-wise , lyrics , melody , everything You can really feel the pain I 'm going through .
I was dating this rock musician at the time that was always on tour .
And I was thinking , ' I bet he 's doing all these things , so why should n't I ? '
So I went into a writer 's session with Josh and told him how I was feeling about this guy , what was going on in my head .
He started strumming the guitar and I just began singing .
It just felt so natural , a really special moment .
I 've never written a song I did n't feel true to .
Everything I 've ever done is a true story .
I feel everything I write .
I ca n't fake it . ''
