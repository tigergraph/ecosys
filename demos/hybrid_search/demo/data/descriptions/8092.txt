Rancid Frontman Tim Armstrong -LRB- From the band 's MySpace site -RRB- : `` Do n't give a f -- k what people say .
Trust your gut and never give up , the rest comes naturally . ''
Bassist Matt Freeman : `` This is one of those songs that the minute I wrote the bass line I regretted it .
Just because of how hard it is to play well consistently .
Its super fast , 16th notes , and all down strokes .
It 's the Dee Dee Ramone technique .
People always underestimated how hard his style was to play until they would try to do it .
Do n't underestimate Dee Dee . ''
Guitarist Lars Frederiksen said : `` I think the chorus says it all .
In the vain of Linton Kwesi Johnson , just sped up some . ''
Drummer Branden Steineckert : `` Another on with each person taking a verse .
This time Tim takes the first verse , Lars the second and Matt the third .
I took a different approach to the drums on this one , somewhat inspired by Dave Mellows drums on Operation Ivy 's Unity .
Again this one felt like a nice rhythm heavy track so it gave me space to throw in some tricks . ''
-LRB- Operation Ivy was an influential late 1980s punk band , whose members included Armstrong and Freeman -RRB- .
