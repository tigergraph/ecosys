This is a track from British R&B / hip hop trio N Dubz 's second album , Against All Odds .
The song preaches the message of safe sex .
Tulisa from N Dubz told Q magazine December 2009 that with this song , `` we 're getting into the minds of kids today .
Too many guys feel nothing about relationships or responsibility .
All they think about is sex .
Its terrible . ''
The song was originally titled , `` Who Do You Think You Are ? ''
The song has a storyline of a young couple arguing whether to keep their unplanned baby .
Tulisa told The Daily Star : `` It 's not something any of us have been through personally .
But everyone knows someone who has .
The three of us wrote down our different perspectives and we based the song around that .
It 's our favourite track on the album . ''
The music video finds Tulisa putting her acting skills to the test by simulating the experience of childbirth .
`` You 'll see the top half of her in hospital with people holding their hands out and all the veins popping out and everything , '' said her band colleague Dappy excitedly to The Observer November 1 , 2009 .
