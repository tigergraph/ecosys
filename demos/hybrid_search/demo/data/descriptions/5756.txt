Serena Ryder tells us that this song is about an ex-boyfriend .
When we asked if he knew the song was about him , she replied : `` I 'm sure he does .
It 's fine .
We 're cool .
`` Ryder goes on to explain that the song can have a more universal meaning : `` That song , it 's like , ` You 're black and white , he 's a little bit of red . '
Really the essence of that song is about a balanced life , about not always seeing things as black and white .
It 's about allowing yourself to feel .
And those lyrics , ` you 're black and white , and he 's a little bit red , ' the imagery of blood or pain or allowing yourself to bleed emotionally and actually feel things .
And to know that things are n't just cut and paste and cut and dry .
Things do n't have to be black and white .
There can be middle ground .
And you can be a lot of things .
And that 's what the song is truly about . ''
