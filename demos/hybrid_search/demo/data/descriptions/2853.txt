Wild Beasts are a British rock quartet comprising vocalist Hayden Thorpe , guitarist Ben Little , bassist Tom Fleming and drummer Chris Talbott .
This call-and-response track in which Thorpe and Fleming offer each other assurance was the quickest song on Smother to write .
Fleming told Drowned in Sound : `` Truly written in 20 minutes , what you hear is Benny looping himself on guitar , Chris looping a phrase of his drums , and Hayden and I singing lyrics as we dreamt them up .
We sang this boy band style , which we have always flirted with . ''
