This was the first single from Petula Clark 's album Lost in You , which was released when she was 80 years old .
It was written by her producer John Williams along with the songwriters Sarah Naghshineh and Paul Visser .
The song uses computer commands as metaphor for devotion .
When we spoke with Petula Clark , she told us that this was her favorite song on the album .
`` I just loved it from the first time I heard the demo , '' she said .
`` And it was sung by a girl who sang it very well , indeed .
I thought , ` Uh oh .
What am I going to do with this ? '
-LSB- Laughing -RSB- I think the production is interesting .
The first mix was actually done in Paris and they did a very good job on it , and it was slightly remixed in England .
It 's got something a bit mysterious about it , and I like that . ''
