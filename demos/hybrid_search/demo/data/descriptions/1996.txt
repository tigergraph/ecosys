In the Blues tradition , this song seems to be about a dance called the `` Velcro Fly , '' but it might have a more suggestive meaning , seeing as a Velcro fly would allow easy access to the lovemaking apparatus .
Why Velcro ?
Billy Gibbons explained in a 1985 interview with Spin magazine : `` I love Velcro , I think it 's the greatest stuff .
I think it was invented in 1936 by a Swiss doctor who was curious why the nettles were sticking to his pants after walking through a field .
We were going to have Velcro guitars and invite objects , hopefully not radical objects , to land on them .
Maybe that 's not such a great idea . ''

The sound of the Velcro in the song is real .
Rather than using a synthesizer to mimic the sound , they just ripped some Velcro appart .
Like Jello and Xerox , Velcro is a brand name that has been genericized .
Songwriters usually shy away from putting product names in titles , as it could lead to legal issues , but there 's no doubt that this song bumped up sales of the fasteners .
The video was choreographed by Paula Abdul , who made an enormous mark on Pop culture as a singer , a judge on American Idol , and the choreographer behind the `` African Anteater Dance '' in the movie Ca n't Buy Me Love .
