The lyrics for Hoobstank 's tunes are primarily written by singer Doug Robb in response to musical ideas dreamed up and laid down by guitarist Dan Estrin and bassist Jesse Charland in their respective home studios .
This Fight or Flight cut embeds an expression of devotion and commitment into a sturdy rock structure .
`` That song was written when my wife was pregnant , '' Robb explained .
`` It sounds more romantic in its final form , but the emotional tone was set with the original theme in mind .
It 's an overall statement of how important your significant other is in your life , in the sense of , ` I 'll put myself on the backburner to make sure everything 's OK with you . '
But it applies to all kinds of relationships , and being a parent , it hits home . ''
