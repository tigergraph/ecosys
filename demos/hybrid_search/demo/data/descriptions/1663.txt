This is the lead single from the Philadelphia-born singer-songwriter Christina Perri 's debut album , Lovestrong .
She explained the song 's meaning : '' ` Arms ' is about the fight between your heart and your mind .
Your heart wants to be loved but your head is always telling you reasons not to be with him or her , or how you are not worth the love .
It 's about the struggle and finally giving in when you 're wrapped in their arms .
Then you get it .
Then you feel loved and love wins . ''
The song 's music video was shot over a two-day period under the direction of British director Sarah Chatfield , whose resume includes clips for Lily Allen , the Noisettes and Lykke Li .
Perri co-wrote the video treatment herself , which found her undertaking a series of physical tests as she played a super-hero .
They included her being dropped into water during a storm , before a cluster of black balloons carry her away into the sky .
`` It was the most challenging two days of my whole life , '' admitted Perri .
`` I came up with some obstacles that represent fear to me . ''
Perri penned the song with the help of former Evanescence member David Hodges , who has also written tunes for Kelly Clarkson and Daughtry .
