Most of the songs on Halcyon were penned by Goulding about her former partner Greg James , including this dark and brooding track .
Speaking about her past relationship with the BBC Radio 1 DJ , she told The Sun : `` My songs are always about things I experience and my ex knows that and my guy now knows that and even my friends know that - everyone knows that .
Greg and I are still friends .
Yes , I was worried about what he 'd think about these songs but he 's heard them and is fine.He 's always been a fan of my music , '' she continued , `` that 's how we met .
I do n't think he takes it too seriously .
That period in our lives has passed now .
We 've moved on .
He texted me the other day to say that he really liked ` Figure 8 ' . ''
Goulding explained the concept for the song 's music video to MTV News : `` I kind of just wanted to put into one video the desperation of unrequited love ; I did n't want to do anything that conceptual , I just wanted to do something just , you now , very performance -LSB- driven -RSB- , '' she said , `` and try to get across as much as possible how horrible , how heartbreaking , how desperate and hopeless it is .
But there 's also a bit in it where I say ` lovers hold on , ' so there 's a little hopeful element to it as well . ''
