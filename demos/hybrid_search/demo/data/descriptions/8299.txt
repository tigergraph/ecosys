This song finds a guilty Matt Berninger pining for redemption as he intones , `` I should live in salt for leaving you behind . ''
The song was the catalyst for The Trouble Will Find Me album .
The plan had been to take time off after High Violet , for the band to recharge their batteries after a long tour .
`` But then , '' recalled guitarist Aaron Dessner to The Guardian , `` towards the end of High Violet I had some ideas and I was home and I started writing them and Matt heard them and he started writing songs immediately .
`` One of them was this tune .
`` And there was something about that song that made me feel like maybe we were making a record already or something , '' he continued .
`` And because that song has a funny extra beat and has a different feeling to High Violet - and I think to anything else we 'd done - it got me kind of excited . ''
Aaron Desner composed the music as a send-up to the Kinks whilst Matt Berninger wrote the lyrics about his fractious relationship with his younger brother Tom .
Berninger told the UK newspaper The Sun ; `` It began as ' I Should Leave Us All ' meaning like I should kill myself or something but that was too much .
Then I changed it to ' I Should Live in Salt ' as in salty tears , living in regret and mourning .
There 's this sense of an estrangement .
And there was an estrangement between my brother and I for 20 years .
So if that song 's about somebody , it 's more about him than anybody else . ''
Tom Berninger had a less-than-successful stint as a roadie for the band during the High Violet tour , which was documented in a film titled Mistaken for Strangers .
