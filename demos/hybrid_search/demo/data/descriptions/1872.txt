This is a track from British alternative rock band Klaxons ' second studio album Surfing the Void .
The disc was produced by Ross Robinson , the ` Godfather of Nu Metal , ' who made his name producing records by Korn and Limp Bizkit .
The song 's working title `` The Parhelion , '' refers to a halo around the sun , an optical illusion caused by ice crystals in the air .
Guitarist Simon Taylor-Davis told the NME June 5 , 2010 that this song was their first fruit from the band 's collaboration with Robinson : `` To me , that was the first one that we nailed with Ross and it was like ` Wow !
We can achieve anything with this guy ! '
I mean the amount of times we tried to play that and record that song ... and the minute Ross touched it , it was just there . ''
