This track from the deluxe and UK editions of electro hop duo LMFAO 's second album , Sorry For Party Rocking was inspired by an altercation with Mitt Romney .
The Republican presidential candidate requested LMFAO 's Sky Blu to put his seat up on the still-grounded airplane pass and the musician refused because of the Mormon politician 's tone .
Romney grabbed him by the shoulder , the pair got into an argument and both were whisked off the airplane .
Though the song does n't feature Romney by name , it refers to a church-going politician and succeeds in teasing him .
