Banhart recalls on this track , queuing to see the Britpop band Suede .
He told The Guardian : `` The settings are autobiographical , but the characters are not .
I stood in line .
But when I stood in line I could n't wait for the line to move so I could watch Suede , the band that I love to this day . ''
