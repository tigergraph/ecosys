This love letter to Harvey 's home country and the dying throes of its Empire borrows from a love song , sung by a Kurdish singer called Kaseem Miro .
Harvey told NME about the sample : `` It 's a beautiful , beautiful song , that I was listening to at the time of writing the album .
I felt like there was a possibility there to marry the two , in the way our voices meet at certain points and somehow bring those two different worlds together . ''
