Lead singer Christian Lindskog said of this song in jesusfreakhideout.com : `` I have just heard about a disease where girls are standing in front of the mirror and staring at themselves for hours .
They get lost and paralyzed inside that image .
It makes me so sad to see these beautiful women hating themselves because they do n't fit some imaginary mold .
I guess to see themselves that way they must be bleeding under their eyelids . ''
