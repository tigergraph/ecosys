This is the closing track of Fallen Empires .
The album is bookended by two stories of separate homeless people that lead vocalist Gary Lightbody met in Santa Monica .
Canadian musician Owen Pallett , who has recorded his own material under the name of Final Fantasy , did the song 's arrangement .
Lightbody told Billboard magazine : `` In the end we just took it down to a piano and it sounded amazing cause it 's so heartbreaking with just a voice and a piano .
And then Owen heard it and he loved it and he said can I do an arrangement for it . ''
