This song is said to be about Courtney Love .
It refers to her dragging Kurt Cobain intro drugs , and ultimately being the cause of his suicide .
`` Why 'd you have to go and let it die '' most likely means why 'd you have to go and let him die , or let Nirvana die in general.Dave Grohl has said of the song : `` It 's a song that 's written about feeling helpless to someone else 's demise .
I 've seen people lose it all to drugs and heartbreak and death .
It 's happened more than once in my life , but the one that 's most noted is Kurt .
And there are a lot of people that I 've been angry with in my life , but the one that 's most noted is Courtney .
So it 's pretty obvious to me that those correlations are gon na pop up every now and again . ''
