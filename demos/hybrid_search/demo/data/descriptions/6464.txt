This song tells a tale of heartache after a girl has left her man .
The song has a lighthearted approach , saying just to blame it on the rain .
The song was written by Diane Warren , who writes relatable songs with memorable titles , often with very impressive results .
The club mix version of the song was included on the US remix album All Or Nothing , which included fragments of other `` rain '' themed songs , like `` Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head '' and `` Walking In The Rain . ''
This version did n't appear on any Milli Vanilli albums until the Greatest Hits release in 2006 .
This song was featured in an episode of the TV show Full House .
Kimmy Gibbler and D.J. Tanner are singing it while they 're doing their homework , then Michelle Tanner sings , `` Rain . .
Rain . .
Go Away ... '' When this reached # 1 it knocked another Diane Warren song off the # 1 spot : `` When I See You Smile , '' recorded by Bad English .
As a result , Warren became the first female songwriter to have back-to-back chart-toppers .
This was Milli Vanilli 's last of 3 US # 1 hits before a scandal revealed that the duo did not actually sing on their album , but were simply a front for performances where they would lip-synch .
The Girl You Know It 's True album was cobbled together by various studio musicians and producers , and the slick , catchy songs became huge hits .
Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan , who fronted Milli Vanilli , were chosen for their distinctive look and their energy .
This song was re-recorded by Sam Moore and Fantasia in August 2006 on their album Overnight Sensational .
The Pop-Rock band Barenaked Ladies referenced this in their song `` Blame It On Me , '' singing , `` Milli Vanilli told you to blame it on the rain - If all else fails , you can blame it on me . ''
