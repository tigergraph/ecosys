Bush penned this song for her son , Bertie , to sing in his still high choirboy voice .
The 13-year-old , who sings the role of a falling snowflake yearning for human contact , previously provided the computer 's voice on the Director 's Cut version of `` Deeper Understanding . ''
Fun Fact : The average speed of a snowflake is 3.1 miles per hour .
Speaking to Mojo magazine , Bush said that she wrote the song for her son , `` to show off this really beautiful voice that he has . ''
She went on to explain there were two ideas : `` Firstly , the idea of this snowflake falling from the sky - this fragile , temporary creation .
And Bertie still has his high voice , but it 's also a fragile instrument , because soon his voice will drop and I thought there was a nice meeting of the two ideas - of this fragile little snowflake making its journey , and this voice that will soon pass . ''
