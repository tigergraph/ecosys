This was the first track to be played from The Cribs ' fifth studio album , In the Belly of the Brazen Bull .
The LP was recorded at London 's Abbey Road and Chicago 's EAR studio with famed lo-fi rock engineer Steve Albini and Tarbox Road studio in New York with David Fridmann -LRB- Mercury Rev , The Flaming Lips -RRB- .
The song was debuted on February 14 , 2012 by Radio 1 Zane Lowe on his radio show and the DJ ended up playing the song three times that evening .
The brazen bull was a life-size hollow bronze that the pre-Christian Sicilian tyrant Phalaris used to lock his victims in before lighting a fire beneath it , causing them to roast to death inside .
So why name an album after its belly ?
Ryan explained to NME : `` Everyone always says ` in the belly of the beast ' when you 're really involved in something .
And we have been .
This record 's not something I 've taken lightly - we 've lived and breathed it for a year .
I guess we are sort of in the belly of the brazen bull.Bassist / vocalist Gary Jarman added that he , `` liked the ` b ' alliteration . ''
During the early days of The Cribs , guitarist/vocalist Ryan Jarman planned to move to Chicago so he could hang around with American musician Bobby Conn , who produced their debut album .
Jarman spent a few months in the Windy City , before moving back to England .
He told NME regarding this tune : `` It kind of bothered me that I did n't go through with my plan to stay .
The Cribs got signed .
But I got a song about it now . ''
The song tells the story of a woman that Ryan came close to marrying before the Cribs got signed .
During an interview with Chart Attack the Cribs guitarist was asked how much the band think about lives that they almost lived , or could have lived ?
He replied : `` Pretty much all the time .
That 's all I spend my time doing .
I 'm always melancholy , always thinking of things that may have happened or wanting to get back to different times of my life . ''
