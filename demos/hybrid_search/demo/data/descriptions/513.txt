In this despairing and somber song , George Michael offers the healing passage of time as the only relief for the many who are suffering poverty and injustice .
In The New York Times September 16 , 1990 , George Michael is quoted regarding this song : `` No event inspired the song .
It 's my way of trying to figure out why it 's so hard for people to be good to each other .
I believe the problem is conditional as opposed to being something inherent in mankind .
The media has affected everybody 's consciousness much more than most people will admit .
Because of the media , the way the world is perceived is as a place where resources and time are running out .
We 're taught that you have to grab what you can before it 's gone .
It 's almost as if there is n't time for compassion . ''
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England , for all above -RRB- Carrie Underwood sang this on the April 2008 Idol Gives Back charity fund raising TV show .
Thanks to the sale of downloads via Apple 's iTunes Music Store , her version charted in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 .
Michael performed the song -LRB- and promoted his upcoming US tour -RRB- on the season finale that year , when David Cook was declared the winner .
George Michael used an echoey vocal effect resulting in a similar fuzzed verbal sound to John Lennon 's `` Imagine . ''
This was the first release from Listen Without Prejudice , Vol .
1 .
It was released after the relationship between Michael and Sony Music became contentious .
When Michael refused to make a video to promote the song , a furious Sony released its own video instead , with only the words being displayed across the screen .
The video died a quick death after Michael made a video for `` Freedom ' 90 '' without him in it .
