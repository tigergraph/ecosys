Singer Ezra Koenig told NME : `` The line ` America do n't love you ' is like that line from ` Hannah Hunt ' : you 're identified as part of that country , but does that mean that everything America does is representative of me ?
It 's a resigned feeling . ''
The song title is a play on words on God 's Hebrew name YAHOWAH -LRB- or YAHWEH -RRB- , and it has a distinctively religious tone .
Ezra Koenig , who wrote the lyrics , was brought up in a Jewish family and had a Bar Mitzvah .
He has n't spent his life practising religion in earnest , but this song finds Koenig asking questions of God .
`` I 'm at a point where I find the simplest idea of faith -- ` Do you believe in God ? '
-- boring , '' Koenig explained to Spin magazine .
`` What I 'm more interested in is group identity , faith in institutions .
To me , identity is ultimately the biggest theme in Vampire Weekend 's songs .
The first album is a bit about outsiders looking at wealth , and being simultaneously attracted to it and critical of it .
A lot of people look at this record as being about God or atheism .
That 's definitely a part of it .
But beyond that , when I think about faith , what comes up in my mind is something that 's bigger than yourself . ''
God first revealed his name to Moses at the burning bush , after the prophet asked Him who He was .
`` I am that I am '' is the common translation of Yahowah , describing His eternal power and unchangeable character .
It was written YHWH in the Hebrew scriptures , as originally there were no vowels in the language .
Jews used ` Adonay ' -LRB- Lord -RRB- instead , for fear of taking God 's name in vain .
The vowels AOA were inserted in YHWH in time , and so came YAHOWAH .
The song 's lyric video , directed by by Greg Brunkalla is a champagne celebration , which culminates in the band getting soaked .
