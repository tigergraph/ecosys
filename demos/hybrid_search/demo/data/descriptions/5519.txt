This broadside against the emptiness of the modern age 's fame culture finds Morissette singing : `` I am a tattooed sexy dancing monkey . ''
She discussed her celebrity with The Guardian : `` I think fame became exciting for me in the late '90s because I could actually use it as a means to an end .
I could actually have it help me serve my vocationfulness .
I could offer comfort and upliftment and be a leader and take on that responsibility , rather than see it as this daunting thing .
Fame became a great tool .
But I still have PTSD from the Jagged Little Pill era .
It was a profound violation .
It felt like every millisecond I was attempting to set a boundary and say no and people were breaking into my hotel rooms and going through my suitcase and pulling my hair and jumping on my car . ''
Morissette explained the song 's meaning to Digital Spy : `` It 's a commentary on the bill of goods that is sold to us all about what fame can afford or yield , '' she said .
`` I was told it would raise my self-esteem and create profound friendships , whereas all it actually did was increase my self-doubt .
Fame as an end in itself is pretty hollow , but you can instead use it as a means to an end - to offer commentary in an entertaining and palatable way .
I 'm now in my late 30s and realise that being in the public eye is a beautiful responsibility and I 'm happy to take it on ! ''
