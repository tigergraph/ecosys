This track is about some of the crazy situations the Atlanta rapper finds himself in a world where he has riches to spare but ca n't save the whole world .
Jeezy told Rolling Stone magazine that the song came out of him one day when he went into the studio to vent .
He added : `` The world is crazy .
We know it and we 're gon na deal with it .
Where else are we gon na live ?
Jupiter ? ''
On this track Jeezy talks about a dilemma he had of wanting to buy a new sports car when his aunt needed a new kidney .
He explained to MTV News why he put his family first .
Said Jeezy : `` That 's Auntie who practically helped raise me .
All she needs to survive is a kidney .
Do you go to a lot and put $ 200,000 on a car , or do you put $ 200,000 in a foundation to help start something up to help her or anybody like her ?
That 's a real-life conflict .
If I get a call while I 'm out on the road saying my auntie passed , that would mess my head up . ''
