This song is about the suicide of a female friend of Westerberg .
He has been quoted as saying he tends to attract suicidal women , which may account for the prevalence of the subject in his music .
The DVD Come Feel Me Tremble shows an introspective Westerberg staring at the mass card from the funeral while the song plays , then he puts the picture in his fireplace .
