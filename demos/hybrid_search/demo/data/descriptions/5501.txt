This song deals with Mudvayne 's frustration when they ca n't deliver their message because their work is restricted , but states that they are determined to perform it regardless : `` Sticker this , censor this , ban this .
We 've got something to say !
Police this , condemn this , damn this !
We 'll be heard anyway ! ''
