This is the title track from American heavy metal band W.A.S.P 's fourteenth studio album .
The record is based around biblical visions of `` The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse '' in the Book of Revelation .
During the worldwide financial meltdown in the second half of , 2008 , frontman Blackie Lawless began doing some research , which led to the genesis of what became this album .
He explained in publicity materials : `` I went back and did a detailed study of the Book of Revelation and refreshed my memory with some pretty amazing reading .
That reading inspires powerful images .
Enough for me to take those images of the 6th chapter of Revelation and the four horsemen of the apocalypse and write ` Babylon 's Burning . '
` Babylon 's Burning ' is based on that imagery in the same way ` Headless Children ' was .
It 's an overview of what we allow ourselves to become and the consequences that befall us for the poor choices we make . ''
