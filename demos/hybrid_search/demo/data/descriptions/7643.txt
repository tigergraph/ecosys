Train frontman Pat Monahan penned this song with Espionage , the Norwegian production duo that helped pen `` Hey Soul Sister . ''
Espionage is made up of Espen Lind and Amund Bjørklund and amongst their other credits are Beyoncé 's `` Irreplaceable '' and Chris Brown 's `` With You . ''
Though the song 's title claims there are 50 ways to say goodbye , we can only find 11 lies about his farewell the protagonist tells , all involving his former beau 's demise .
They are :1 .
Went down in an airplane .2 .
Fried getting suntan .3 .
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand .4 .
She met a shark under water .5 .
Fell and no one caught her .6 .
Caught in a mudslide .7 .
Eaten by a lion .8 .
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion .9 .
Dried up in the desert .10 .
Drowned in a hot tub .11 .
Danced to death at an east side night club .
The song 's melody has been compared by some reviewers to Andrew Lloyd Webber 's `` The Phantom of the Opera . ''
The song follows a similar theme to Paul Simon 's `` 50 Ways To Leave Your Lover , '' though in this instance it 's the narrator 's pride that has been hurt as he looks for excuses to tell his friends why she 's disappeared from his life .
The Mariachi influenced horns are played by Brad Magers , whose day job is the bass player for The Bronx .
The Los Angeles-based rock band have also released two albums under their alter egos `` Mariachi El Bronx , '' in which they play Mariachi music in place of their usual hardcore punk styles .
