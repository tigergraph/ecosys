Lead singer Christian Lindskog told jesusfreakhideout.com : `` When I was in South Africa , we visited a guy in the hospital named Sipho .
He knew he was going to die .
Knowing he was so close to death , we prayed with him and we watched his eyes change .
I have never seen something change so dramatically .
It was like watching a light in his soul be turned on . ''
