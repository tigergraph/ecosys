This cover of an obscure Country hymn from Carter Family contemporary Alfred Karnes features the additional vocals of Emmylou Harris , and Shawn Colvin .
The song comes from an album of several Gospel songs in which Griffin invokes various religious themes .
It is a song about being reunited with loved ones after they have passed away .
Much like her 2013 song `` Go Wherever You Wan na Go , '' this one paints a pretty picture of the afterlife as something that people can look forward to , rather than having to dread .
