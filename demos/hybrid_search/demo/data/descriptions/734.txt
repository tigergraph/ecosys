In this song , the narrator is driving at night while tired , and in a moment of inattention , he hits a young lady who 's just stepped off the street .
Instead of staying , he leaves the scene of the crime .
The man then visits the woman , who 's now in a coma , at the hospital and hopes she 'll wake up someday .
