Shakira teamed up again with her former `` Hips Do n't Lie '' collaborator , Wyclef Jean , to record this song .
`` We both grew up in the developing world , '' Shakira said of Wyclef to MTV News .
`` We both have been very close to another kind of reality - you know , extreme poverty .
People who do n't have the ability to get access to education or even fulfilling their basic needs .
And we both share the same visions and the same views about the world and what we can all do to - in our own small way - change that .
So that is a recurrent topic of conversation between him and I. '' This track has a similar theme to `` Hips Do n't Lie '' with Shakira and Wyclef exchanging lines of seduction with one another .
However , musically it is different and Shakira told MTV News that the pair experimented with a some different sounds before producing this retro disco track .
She explained : `` We hung out in Bahamas , which is where I live .
After a few days searching , looking for different inspirational sources , we got to ` Spy , ' which is a different direction for both of us .
But we instantly recognized the value of the song .
It 's definitely different .
It 's sexy in its own way . ''
