This is a track from the second soundtrack from the Nickelodeon TV series , iCarly .
The show 's star , Miranda Cosgrove , explained to MTV News why she wanted to record this song : `` It 's kind of about like I was in a relationship and the person meant everything to me and then it 's that feeling that you have when you break up with someone and you 're kind of questioning everything , '' she said .
`` And you do n't really know what went wrong and you really cared about the person .
So I mean I just try to do songs that are different experiences I 've been through and stuff that I think people that watch my show can relate to . ''
