`` The Man Who Could n't Cry '' begins like a twisted nursery rhyme which , of course , is the best kind : There once was a man who just could n't cryHe had n't cried for years and yearsNapalmed babies and the movie Love StoryFor instance could not produce tears.The movie Love Story -LRB- 1970 -RRB- was a maudlin tearjerker starring Ryan O'Neal as a wealthy college student in love with the cancer-stricken Ali MacGraw .
Napalmed babies -LRB- a reference to the Vietnam War -RRB- are one thing , but ca n't cry at Love Story ?
Unthinkable !
Wainwright spoke of the song 's genesis , and legacy , in an interview with the A.V. Club : `` That 's a kind of strange , long , allegorical song .
I just kind of made that one up about somebody , although the idea of not being able to cry is an interesting one , particularly for men .
The exciting thing about that one is that Johnny Cash recorded it , which was a huge thrill , to have somebody of his stature think it was good enough to record .
I always think of that when I think of that song .
`` Cash recorded the song during a live performance at the Viper Room nightclub in Los Angeles .
It was released on his 1994 American Recordings album .
