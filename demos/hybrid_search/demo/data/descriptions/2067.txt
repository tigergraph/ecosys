Earl linked up with The Neptunes and Chicago producers Christian Rich for this track .
Christian Rich 's Taiwo revealed to MTV News that Pharrell Williams spent most of the day working on Robin Thicke 's smash hit `` Blurred Lines , '' but took a short break to knock out this track with his Neptunes partner , Chad Hugo .
`` Pharrell was in the next room making ` Blurred Lines ' with Robin Thicke -LSB- although -RSB- we did n't know it was ` Blurred Lines ' back then , '' Taiwo explained .
`` He came in and was like , ` This is the slowest beat I ever did , it 's like 60 BPM -- here .
He literally walked out for 20 minutes and came back in . ''
The song title does not appear in the lyrics , but is a reference to Earl 's grandma 's Burgundy carpet .
Sweatshirt made his national television debut on August 9 , 2013 when he performed this song on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon .
Earl 's friend and fellow L.A. MC , Vince Staples , contributes an eerie introduction in which he tells the rapper to snap out of his depression , shut up and rap : `` Why you so depressed and sad all the time like a little bitch ?
What 's the problem , man ?
Niggas want to hear you rap Do n't nobody care how you feel . ''
Earl then proceeds to explain what 's getting him down : `` My grandma 's passing But I 'm too busy trying to get this f -- kin ' album crackin ' To see her , so I apologize in advance if anything should happen And my priorities are f -- ked up I know it Afraid I 'm gon na blow it . ''
Earl is concerned that he 's got the balance wrong between pursuing his musical career and family life .
However , he 's working hard to complete the album and is unable to visit his ill Grandma , Doris , -LRB- whom the album is named after -RRB- .
The `` Cut that bitch off ! ''
vocal in the backdrop is sampled from Preacher 's `` The Power of the Truth . ''
