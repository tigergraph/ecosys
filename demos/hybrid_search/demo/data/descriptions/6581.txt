Josh `` Deakin '' Dibb -LRB- from AUX Magazine -RRB- : `` Pulleys '' sounds different than a lot of the record .
There 's a certain thing we tapped into here , the pace of it , there 's this Southeast Asian psych sort of thing . ''
Beachwood Sparks and All Night Radio axeman Dave Scher contributes the lap steel guitar to this track .
Regarding Dave ` Avey Tare ' Portner 's lyrics , Deakin told AUX Magazine : `` In terms of the way Dave wrote these lyrics , there 's a lot of different ways you can hear it that are n't what he was thinking but that have very deep , emotional resonance with me .
I think it fits really well with the next song -LRB- `` Amanita '' -RRB- .
