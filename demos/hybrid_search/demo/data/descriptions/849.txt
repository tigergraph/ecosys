Nas explained this track where he raps from the perspective of a roach to MTV News : `` I get to thinking about how we evolved , how the human family evolved and s -- t. And I looked at ants , man .
One day , I was looking at a bunch of ants .
We 've got a lot in common - just like everything that 's alive , everything that eats and breathes and builds and creates .
There 's a connection to even the smallest thing .
So I looked at it as the whole world , instead of looking at us as beauty .
Inside poverty , inside the street , inside the ghettos and the gutters and the slums , we are n't looked at as beauty out there .
We were looked at as the worst pest , and because of that , because of that treatment , some of us started to believe we were a pest , started to believe what we were told , and started to act like it , and started to reproduce my people , bring kids in the world that were f -- ked up in the head .
You 're not this .
But if you want to act like this and you want to be this , let 's make the metaphor and let me put you right here and say , ` Cool . '
The roach motel could be the jails or whatever .
Let me just paint that picture and see how you like that .
You do n't like that , do you ?
If you do n't like that , shake it off , get right and let 's start getting the things we supposed to have . ''
The veteran act The Last Poets feature on this track .
In the early 1970s they laid the groundwork for Hip-Hop with their socially conscious songs performed in a spoken word style .
