Never Shout Never 's Christofer Ingle explained this song to Artist Direct : `` I wanted a difficult feel for that track , with the strings at the end .
Basically , I want to tell people about my past .
A lot of people do n't understand that things have been hard before .
I 'm always constantly battling things with myself , and I wanted to get a little darker feel on that song .
It 's an open door experience for the future .
I like writing dark songs .
It 's been really fun , sad and cool .
I like making dark lyrics because I can get really poetic with them .
I just want to be able to open doors with that song for like later stuff . ''
