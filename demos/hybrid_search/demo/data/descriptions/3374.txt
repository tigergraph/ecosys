This is a track from Irish boyband Westlife 's album , Where We Are .
Kian Egan of Westlife commented in publicity materials : `` I think , for me anyways , this is my favourite song outside the first single .
Simply because I think it 's a whole new fresh thing for Westlife , a whole new fresh sound , a completely different feel but still very Westlife .
It 's a fantastic pop song , I certainly think it would make everybody kinda go ` Woaw ! ' .
In general , you know , it 's got a bit more tempo to it , it 's got a different feel to it , certainly a new sound for Westlife but for me it 's the best song on the album after the first single . ''
