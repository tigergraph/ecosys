Drummer/vocalist Brann Dailor -LRB- from Kerrang !
magazine -RRB- : `` Brent -LRB- Hinds , vocals/guitar -RRB- came up with this riff and he was so stoned he could barely play because it was pretty bedazzling - hence the name .
It has a weird sci-fi thing in the middle , too .
Troy -LRB- Sanders , bass -RRB- came up with an awesome vocal line which really elevated the song . ''
