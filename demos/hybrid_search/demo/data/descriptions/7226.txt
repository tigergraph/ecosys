The song was brought to the band by Butch Vig .
`` He had the verse and chorus , and he already had the harp idea , '' guitarist Duke Erikson explained to MusicRadar.com . ''
Everybody liked it .
It sounded like it could have a lot of impact .
Basically , we tried to inject a lot of power into the song . ''
`` I came up with the bridge idea , '' he added , `` and all four of us chimed in on that .
We wanted to make the last chorus totally chaotic , so I opened up the gate and ran a pulse through it .
The whole song sounded like it was out of control . ''
Erikson discussed the instrumentation he used : `` I think I played a Tele on the verses and a Strat on the second chorus , '' he said .
`` There may have been a SG involved .
The template for the song was When The Levee Breaks .
We did kind of a funked up take on that .
It was even bigger sounding at one point , but the rhythmic pattern was getting lost , so we brought it back a notch or two . ''
In a 2012 interview with FaceCulture , lead singer Shirley Manson said , `` Control is about facing the face that ultimately we are all gon na die .
And why are holding onto these weird , fixed ideas of who we are , what we are , what we 're capable of .
It 's about urgency .
It 's about vigor , about life and letting things move through you instead of holding on tight . ''
Butch Vig plays harmonica on the track .
`` My six-year-old daughter has a harmonica and she left it in my home studio , '' he said .
`` We were working on the song one morning and I picked it up and started blowing on it .
I ca n't really play harmonica , the part is dead simple , anyone could figure it out .
I did n't think we would actually use it and then we left it in the song , we mixed it .
We made this record kind of guerrilla style . ''
