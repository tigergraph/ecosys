This was released as the first single from The Paradigm Shift , Korn 's first album to feature original guitarist Brian `` Head '' Welch since 2003 's Take a Look in the Mirror .
Guitarist James `` Munky '' Shaffer explained that the album 's title has special significance for the band members .
`` It 's a term encompassing different perspectives , '' he said .
`` You can view a piece of art from one angle and it takes on a certain image .
If you look from another angle , it 's a completely different image .
We liken that to Korn in 2013 .
With Head back in the fold , all of the elements fans have loved since day one are there , but we 're interpreting them from a new perspective .
It 's a bigger , brighter and bolder Korn . ''
Jonathan Davis expanded on the story of the song : `` It was an amazing night when we finished that song , '' he said .
`` It 's a relationship song .
You go through that s -- t and you get hurt so bad .
Then you think , ` It 's not worth it anymore .
I 'm not going to fu -- ing love again . '
You experience so many pressures to be a good dad , a good husband , a good lover , or whatever .
Being in a relationship is a lot of work . ''
The song was initially in danger of being left off The Paradigm Shift tracklisting .
`` When I heard it we were like , ` Oh , that 's pretty cool , but I do n't know if it 's something we 're going for on this thing , '' Brian Welch recalled to Billboard magazine .
`` Even -LRB- Don Gilmore , producer -RRB- was like , ` Yeah , I do n't know if it 's gon na be a contender , but let 's see . ''
`` Then , as we were packing up and getting ready to leave , '' he continued , `` Ray -LRB- Luzier -RRB- was like , ` Should n't we lay drums on that one song Jonathan did , just in case ? '
and the producer 's like , ' I do n't think we need to , but if you want to just to have it , we could . '
So they threw the drums down and Jonathan and Don Gilmore went to work on the vocals and , boom , when the vocals were there it was like , ` Oh , wow , this could be a really cool song , ' and now it 's the first single . ''
Singer Jonathan Davis explained the song 's meaning to The Pulse of Radio : `` It 's about relationships , '' he said .
`` It 's about anything .
It seems like you try and try to make things work and you repeatedly fail at it .
It 's just like , throw your hands up in the air and give up , and it 's that kind of vibe .
I was feeling that towards life , basically . ''
The melodic , commercial style of this song met with some mixed reactions from Korn fans , which singer Jonathan Davis told Metal Hammer magazine was his intention .
He explained , `` We put this out first cause I knew it was going to piss off a lot of people .
And um , so I did it .
That song ai n't for dudes , it 's for the ladies . ''
