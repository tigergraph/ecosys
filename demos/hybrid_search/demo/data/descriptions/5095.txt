Speaking with CBC Music , Sexsmith described this as `` a humorous song , the whole Adam and Eve thing , and it 's about temptation , about trying to stay on the path . ''
Forever Endeavour was helmed by Mitchell Froom , the producer on Sexsmith 's first three albums as well as 2006 's Time Being .
Their collaboration came about after Sexsmith ran into Froom in Los Angeles and the pair got talking about working together again .
The Canadian singer told CBC Music that he loved Froom 's arrangement on this song as he , `` never saw it being that funky with the horn and piano .
It was one of those songs I initially was n't even sure I wanted to record , but when I heard his arrangement I thought , wow , that 's awesome , I just hope I can sing it . ''
