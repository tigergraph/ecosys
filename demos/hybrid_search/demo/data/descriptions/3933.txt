This piano-driven song is a track from American alternative band The Used 's fourth studio album , Artwork .
Even though this is bright tonally , lyrically this is one of The Used 's darkest ever songs .
Frontman and songwriter Bert McCracken told Artistdirect.com : `` I originally wrote that song about something else deeper .
The tone of the song seems so operatic or almost soap -- operatic -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
It 's such a devastation from the beginning .
In a way , the song is whatever you want it to be .
It 's a `` F -- k you '' or it 's an `` I love you the most . ''
Either , it 's `` I 'm not kissing you goodbye .
I 'm f -- king out of here , '' or it 's like , `` I 'm not kissing you goodbye .
You 're everything .
I 'm not leaving .
I 'm not going . ''
You could perceive it two ways .
It 's almost like saying , `` Get the f -- k out of my life , '' but at the same time it 's like saying , `` I ca n't live without you .
I ca n't do anything without you . ''
The song is the perfect dichotomy between where relationships fall apart . ''
