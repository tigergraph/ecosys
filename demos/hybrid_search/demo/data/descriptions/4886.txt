The band originally had doubts about including this tune on Centipede Hz .
Josh `` Deakin '' Dibb told AUX Magazine : `` The moment we started talking about the record and what we were going to record , at least some of the guys in the band -LSB- felt -RSB- this one did n't fit with the record .
To me , it seemed like it was taking a backseat .
Once we put some effort in and got it recorded , everyone came around and saw how it was a good one . ''
Deakin discussed Dave ` Avey Tare ' Portner 's lyrics for this track .
`` Dave 's lyrics sort of ride this line of having a linear direct statement or story-feeling on it , '' he told AUX Magazine , `` and at the same time , have this sort of vagueness .
When he does that at his best moment , there 's these suggestions of thoughts or ideas or emotions that you can sort of pick up .
I feel like you can hear different things in it depending on how you 're listening to it .
I really like songs that do that . ''
