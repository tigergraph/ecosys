Three of the songs on All Days Are Nights : Songs For Lulu are adaptations of Shakespeare 's sonnets .
Wainwright composed music for each of the trio , along with several others , after playwright/director Robert Wilson asked him to help on his 2009 production Sonette , which premiered in Berlin in April 2009 .
`` I knew a little bit about the sonnets , but I 'd never immersed myself in them before , and I really did for this project , '' Wainwright explained to Billboard magazine .
`` Once you dip into that stream you 're pretty much rushed down the river by the beauty of it all .
There is an innate musicality within the vowels and the consonants and the spaces and so forth .
My life changed after the sonnet , so I thought it was necessary to present that new addition to my lexicon . ''
This is one of 154 sonnets that Shakespeare wrote , which were circulated amongst colleagues of his patron the Earl of Southampton .
1-126 were addressed to a `` fair youth , '' 127-154 to a `` dark lady . ''
The first part of the album title , `` All Days Are Nights '' , comes from the final couplet `` Sonnet 43 '' -LRB- `` All days are nights to see till I see thee ... '' -RRB- .
