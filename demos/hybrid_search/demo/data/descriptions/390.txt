This is a song about a guy Rufus met in Greece .
The story goes that Rufus met him and they talked , but when Rufus tried to make out with him , the Greek got freaked out .
`` Save your poison for a lover who is on your side '' is an example of Rufus telling him , if you 're going to talk about loving men , act like it or save your poison for women .
