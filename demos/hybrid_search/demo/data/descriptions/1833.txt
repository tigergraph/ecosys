Chevelle singer and guitarist Pete Loeffler discussed the story of this acoustic-driven song with Artist Direct : `` For ` Prima Donna , ' I went backwards in my head .
I remembered a time where I was probably out with some friends and there were some rich girls that I was hanging around in this wealthy area of Chicago .
It was always fun - especially when you 're in your teens - but it was weird .
The ` Prima Donna ' title just had to go on there .
It 's funny when you write songs at different points in your life .
Different things come out , and you do n't really know why .
Maybe I was longing for that time when nothing was really a big deal . ''
The phrase `` prima donna '' is Italian for `` first lady . ''
Opera companies originally used the term to designate their leading female singer to whom the prime roles would be given .
Because of their pulling power at the box office , some of these Prima Donnas were overly demanding and exhibited an inflated view of themselves , however because of their talent , and pulling power at the box office , their excesses were indulged .
Today the term has become a mainstream word outside opera to describe an often-temperamental person with high expectations of others who becomes angry when his or her standards or demands are not met .
