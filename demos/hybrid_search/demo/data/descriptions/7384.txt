`` Dance To The Music '' was written by Sylvester Stewart -LRB- better known as Sly Stone -RRB- .
It was their first charting single , coming from their second album .
It foretold the future success of Stand !
, their fourth album , which became their breakout album and gave them their first # 1 hit .
`` Dance To The Music '' has since been ranked # 223 on Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.In spite of the success of this breakout hit , none of the group members particularly liked the song , with saxophonist Jerry Martini dismissing it as `` glorified Motown beats '' and said that the song was an `` unhip '' thing for them to do .
This song and album helped launch the `` psychedelic soul '' sound of the early '70s .
The Temptations , The Impressions , The Four Tops , The Jackson 5 and The Undisputed Truth all would later show tremendous influence from Dance To The Music .
In For the Record : Sly & the Family Stone : An Oral History , by Joel Selvin , Joel said of the group : `` there are two types of black music : black music before Sly Stone , and black music after Sly Stone . ''
Originally , Sly Stone wanted to go in more of a psychedelic rock direction .
CBS Record 's executive Clive Davis urged him to make his second album more pop-friendly .
Stone would waver between the two for many albums after , displaying skills at various styles and genres , while keeping true to his message of peace , brotherly love , and racial harmony .
