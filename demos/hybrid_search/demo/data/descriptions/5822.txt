One theory is that this song is about Methadone , which is a pink/reddish color .
Layne Staley may have either entertained getting on , or actually got on a Methadone program .
`` Artificial Red , smoke , poison consumed in the house of ill repute '' : Methadone clinics are filled with cigarette smokers , they are dirty , and they are not non-profit .
They want people to believe they are helping , and to some degree they are , but they are in business to make money , and they do n't want you to leave .
They let you take your `` dose '' up as high as you like , and it 's miserable go back down .
Layne could have seen this and likened it to the clinic whoring out the methadone , hence the `` House of Ill Repute . ''
`` Is this the way I spend my days in recovery of a fatal disease ? ''
: Methadone patients have to come to the clinic everyday , stand in line -LRB- which is sometimes for a long time -RRB- , are submitted UA 's and are generally miserable .
`` Alone , untouched is what I crave '' : This could indicate that this methadone idea was n't his , maybe he 's doing it for other people .
Maybe he just wants to sit at home , continue doing heroin , and be left alone .
`` Is this the place I search for Love ?
When my need is within my , a gift from above . ''
: His `` need within '' was his craving for heroin , he probably thinks he was born that way , hence `` gift from above . ''
