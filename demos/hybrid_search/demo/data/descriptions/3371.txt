This is the third single from Scottish singer-songwriter Paolo Nutini 's second album , Second Side Up .
Having no lead in your pencil is an euphemism for impotency , so in this song the narrator is claiming to have no problems in his sex life .
His `` fully leaded pencil '' is just one of the reasons why he 's feeling so good about life .
In a review , Q magazine described this piece of swing jazz as `` How Louis Armstrong might have sung had he been born in Paisley . ''
