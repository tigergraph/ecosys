This song was used in Mariah Carey 's movie Glitter , but it was not written about her character , or anything that had to do with the movie .
It was written for her friend and stylist , Tonjua Twist , who committed suicide in 2000 .
It was a difficult time for Mariah and this song is her tribute to Tonjua .
