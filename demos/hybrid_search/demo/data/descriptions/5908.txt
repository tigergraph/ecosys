This song is a full-on-rap that deals with issues of prejudice and unity .
The Sun July 4 , 2008 asked Tricky if he 'd ever done anything like this before .
He replied : `` That was a new thing , even though the start of my music career was based around rap .
I enjoyed being political on that track .
It 's me trying to understand what the f -- k is going on .
I could be Muslim , I could be Jewish , I could be a Ku Klux Klan guy - but we all bleed .
We 're all the same but we do n't have anything in common .
I grew up in a mixed-race family and , at Christmas , saw people who were very white and very dark .
To us , it was normal .
I think it 's strange how we get separated by religion or color . ''
