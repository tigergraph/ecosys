The corner of 53rd Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan , New York , is a real place that was once frequented by young male prostitutes trying to turn a trick .
The area was a section of what was known as `` the Loop , '' which also boasted gay bars such as Rounds and Red .
In 1994 , a crackdown by police with heavy support from the neighborhood saw an end to the area 's nighttime activities , and despite protests by gay advocate groups , many arrests were made and the bars were shuttered .
This song tells about young male prostitutes , known as chicken hawks , selling sexual favors to older men for cash .
There was a rumor that Dee Dee Ramone engaged in that same activity to earn drug money in the days before he joined the band , but if there 's any truth to it , he took it to his grave .
