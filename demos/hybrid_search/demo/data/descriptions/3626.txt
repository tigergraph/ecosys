This is one of several songs that Doolittle co-wrote with Geordie songwriter Craigie Dodds , who 's best known for his work with the Sugababes .
In an interview with The Guardian , she paid tribute to Dodds : `` We wrote Missing really , really fast -- I wrote the top line in about 10 minutes .
He has the soul of the world in him .
I want him to be my uncle . ''
The song samples The Fleetwoods ' 1959 hit `` Come Softly To Me . ''
It was Dodds who introduced Doolittle to the tune .
