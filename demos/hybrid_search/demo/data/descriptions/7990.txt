Confessions is an album based on the seven deadly sins .
Frontman Josh Todd based the album 's lyrics on his childhood and transformation into adulthood .
He told Classic Rock Revisited : `` Doing a record around the Sins is something Keith -LSB- Nelson -RSB- and I talked about for a couple of years .
A lot of people have covered the subject in bands and in movies , but they are just so cool and they are timeless .
We wanted to do our own take on it . ''
The seven deadly sins are pride , wrath , envy , lust , gluttony , avarice and sloth .
They are supposedly mortal sins as opposed to pardonable ones and carry the threat of eternal damnation .
There is no reference to them in the Bible , but the list was drawn up by the early Christian church and Pope Gregory I drew them into Catholic teachings .
The Roman Catholic Church teaches that such mortal sins can only be forgiven by confession and penance .
Regarding this song , Todd explained to Classic Rock Revisited : `` I wanted kind of a title track to bring it all together , so we came up with that song .
It has a great groove to it and the way the melody goes in and out of those pockets just fu -- ing punches you . ''
A 2011 report based on a study of confessions carried out by Jesuit scholar Father Roberto Busa outlined how the sexes deal differently with the seven deadly sins .
Two lists were compiled , one for men and one for women .
Men 's greatest weakness , it said , was lust , followed by gluttony , sloth and then anger , whilst women most usually confess to sins of pride and envy , followed by anger .
