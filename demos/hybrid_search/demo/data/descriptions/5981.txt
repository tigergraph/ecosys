One of singer and songwriter Brian Fallon 's most frequent lyrical themes concern leaving things behind and looking back at them with a melancholic nostalgia .
The American Slang track `` Old Haunts '' has similar subject matter .
Clash magazine asked Fallon where this comes from ?
He replied : `` I 'm shocked at how fast how your younger ages go away from you .
I 'm not really old at all , I 'm pretty young , but your teens and your early twenties are just gone so fast .
I do n't know if everyone thinks this , but I 'm just like ... where did all that time go ?
That time for me was so hard , I was really struggling .
I got out of school when I was 18 and was constantly working and constantly trying to make this band work and never had any money , sleeping on floors and stuff .
I feel like in a little bit of a way that I missed out on the times where your supposed to go out with your friends and be care free .
I did n't get that part of life .
Never in my life was it just care free , I always had a job even when I was a little kid . ''
The Handwritten album finds The Gaslight Anthem seeking to ask the same questions that fans may be asking themselves .
`` When you pose a question that someone else has been thinking about for a while , sometimes the most comforting thing in the world is to know that someone else does n't have the answer either , '' Fallon told Billboard magazine .
`` That 's what we were doing on this record . ''
Handwritten 's title reflects how the album was conceived and crafted .
`` I really did write the lyrics in a notebook ; they were all literally written by hand , '' Fallon explained to Jam !
Music .
`` Around the time I started writing these songs , a friend of mine gave me a letter and a poem he wrote .
And that just sparked me ; what if a record was a letter sent straight to the listener ?
It hit me that it was the most heartfelt thing I could do . ''
