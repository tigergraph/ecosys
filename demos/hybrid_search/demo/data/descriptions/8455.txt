This is the title track of the eighth studio album by singer-songwriter Aimee Mann , which was released by SuperEgo Records on September 18 , 2012 .
She told Mojo magazine about its title : `` The title of the record is Charmer and I 've always been fascinated by people who are charming .
Because , in the best sense of the word , those people are really fun to be around , they drive the social interaction and it 's on a continuum .
But from ` charming ' you can get to ` narcissistic ' and from that you can get ` manipulative ' and eventually ` sociopath ' .
So for me , it 's interesting to see where people fall on that , to see how they can get what they want with their charm . ''
Mann is intimately familiar with charmers , having been around her share of entertainers and politicians .
`` They 're usually people who you really like being around in the beginning , '' she explained , `` and then they 're very exhausting after a while , because they require an audience .
But that 's very seductive . ''
The song sees Mann retreating to what she calls a lyrical ` pet theme . '
She told Mojo : `` I 'm definitely interested in the ` crazy girl ' archetype and the guys who get involved with the crazy girl . ''
Mann 's other half , singer-songwriter Michael Penn , contributed a lyric .
She explained : `` My husband has a line in a song which I always think about when I talk about this subject , which is : ` When you think he likes you , you like the way he thinks . '
To me , that really sums it up , because you yourself are complicit in the interaction of the charmer .
As soon as you think somebody likes you , then you suddenly think , ` What a great guy ! '
`` Michael Penn is the brother of actors Sean and Chris Penn. .
