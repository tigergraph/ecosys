We Are the Fallen began forming in 2003 when Ben Moody -LRB- guitar -RRB- had discussions with John LeCompt -LRB- guitar -RRB- and Rocky Gray -LRB- drums -RRB- about Evanescence moving in a different direction than originally planned .
It was only when they recruited bassist Marty O'Brien and American Idol Season 7 finalist Carly Smithson as vocalist that the quintet were able to put their ideas into practice .
Smithson told Artist Direct : `` These are moments , memories and things we 've been holding onto .
A lot of the songs are ideas that we 'd wanted to write about for ages but it was n't the right situation in the past .
There 's a song called ` St. John . '
I had the idea for that song for a long time , but it would 've been weird to many songwriters .
To these guys , it 's not .
John gave me this incredibly crazy track that was just the perfect combination of music and theme .
It creates this Wizard of Oz meets ` This Is Halloween ' story .
As soon as I heard the track , it was perfect for the concept I had . ''
