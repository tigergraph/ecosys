Meiert Avis -LRB- U2 , Paramore -RRB- directed the song 's music video .
She explained its concept to MTV News : `` To try and emulate kind of an epic-y song that 's almost like a film , it was a challenge to come up with a treatment .
So I guess we sort of decided to make it like a death march .
You ca n't live anymore in this world , and you 're on your way to your death , and you 're seeing everything you 're passing , and stripping yourself of your belongings on your way to your grave . ''
