New Amerykah Part Two -LRB- Return of the Ankh -RRB- is the fifth studio album by American R&B and neo soul musician Erykah Badu .
In contrast to its predecessor New Amerykah Part One , it features more personal and love-related lyrical themes .
The song samples Sylvia Striplin 's 1981 soul classic `` You Ca n't Turn Me Away , '' in the same way as the original Junior Mafia track did .
On this track , Badu reworks Junior M.A.F.I.A. featuring Notorious B.I.G. 's track `` Get Money , '' from a woman 's point of view .
A playful Badu takes on the role of a female player and uses money as a metaphor for all she wants from her lover .
It concludes with the singer quoting from the chorus Kanye West 's Gold Digger : `` I ai n't messing with no broke nigger . ''
