The second single from English teenage soul singer Dionne Bromfield 's sophomore studio album , Good For The Soul , features Lil Wayne protégé Lil Twist .
It was released on June 17 , 2011 .
The song 's music video was directed by Trudy Bellinger and features Chris and Wes , winners of the 2011 season of Sky 1 's show Got to Dance , as Dionne 's backup dancers .
She told DirectLyrics about the clip : `` Shooting the video was so much fun .
I had to play three different characters of myself so it was a long day but I loved every second of it !
I got to show a different side of myself in this video -- a more glam , grown up side .
I think the song still represents me as a 15 year old girl though .
`` Unfortunately , due to scheduling problems Lil Twist was unable to participate in the video .
Dionne penned the song herself .
She said of the track : '' ` Foolin ' is a song about a girl who gets taken for a ride by a guy .
It 's a really fun song I think a lot of listeners will relate too . ''
