Computers And Blues finds Mike Skinner calling time on his Streets name , and on this album closer he raps about moving on .
Said Skinner to The Daily Record : `` Recording this song did make me emotional , but it did n't make me emotional about The Streets .
It made me emotional about leaving jobs , which I have done ... though not for a long time , admittedly . ''
The song features British singer-songwriter Clare Maguire , who was announced on January 3 , 2011 as coming in fifth place in the BBC Sound of 2011 list of the most promising new artists .
She told Digital Spy about the collaboration : `` Being in the studio with Mike Skinner was amazing - apparently Mike said to my manager while I was singing , ` Oh I did n't realise she could write as well ! '
He took away the chorus I 'd come up with it and put his own song around it , which is just insane and brilliant . ''
