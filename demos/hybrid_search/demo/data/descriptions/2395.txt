Drake is incredible .
I met him at Summer Jam , very respectable .
That was the first time I met him .
Really nice kid .
I love the record -LSB- ` Best I Ever Had ' -RSB- .
Every woman in the world should love that record .
-LSB- He 's -RSB- very innocent and humble .
He 's like , ` I 'm just doing what I do and happy to be doing it . ' ''
Blige uses Auto-Tune on this song .
She explained why to Martinez : `` It was for effect .
I wanted ` Crazy Mary ' to get her shine on .
She could n't get her shine with my regular voice .
I used the effect .
I used it as a telephone effect or reverb . ''
