Dave Grohl in the Daily Mail November 23 , 2007 : `` We used a line from this song as the album title .
It was poetic and it summed up the diversity of the album . ''
Musically , this is very different from the typical Foo Fighters song .
It is almost entirely Dave Grohl on piano .
Dave Grohl called this the best song he 's ever written .
He had made that claim about `` Times Like These '' until this was released .
This was featured an episode of the TV show E.R. titled `` Coming Home . ''
