This is the only track on My Dinosaur Life not produced by Blink-182 's Mark Hoppus .
Drummer Tony Thaxton explained to Alternative Press that the band `` recorded a version with him , but when we went into record some acoustic tracks this past fall , -LSB- producer -RSB- Ed Ackerson had an idea for the song that he wanted us to try out .
We thought maybe it would just be an alternate version of the song .
Once we finished it , we all ended up liking it more than the original version .
We had just enough time to change the record to swap out those tracks .
I think some early promos of the record even have the original version on them . ''
