While opening for U2 in the summer of 2012 , One Republic frontman Ryan Tedder observed the effect of Bono 's lyrics on the Irish band 's fans , as they sung along to their songs .
`` These lyrics are so from his gut and so like honest , but poetic , '' Tedder told Radio.com `` They 're not trying to be ambiguous or trying to be cool .
`` Inspired , Tedder decided that with Native he was going to write lyrics people could relate to , which meant he would have to share a little bit of himself .
Accordingly , nothing on the album is a work of fiction .
This song , for instance is a love letter to the singer 's son , Copeland Cruz , who was born in 2010 .
