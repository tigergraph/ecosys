This elegant choral pop vision of dying crops and abused nature makes the listener feel they do n't belong on their own planet .
Bellamy told NME : `` I nearly called the song ` Alien Explorers ' not in the way of aliens from outer space but in the way of feeling like an alien on your own planet .
It 's about the intense desire to grow and expand - at some point nature will become the minority .
I 'm not sure if I 'm really coming from an environmental thing ... that song 's where I 'm singing about my views on property rights .
The idea that corporations can own vast tracts of foreign countries .
I 'm not sure if the deal went through but , I think it was in Paraguay or Uruguay , the Bush family bought something like a million acres of land which underneath contains the biggest natural water reservoir in South America .
At some point there has to be someone who says , ` That 's not right . '
Can BP buy Nigeria ?
At the moment they can .
They could buy it and they kick all the natives out , shoot them down or whatever and just ` We own this now . ''
According to Bellamy , he feels his lyrics are more about self-expression than specific political statements .
He told The Observer : `` When I dabble in watching the news and reading about current events I tend to get a future negative view and that 's something I 've dealt with through music .
It 's quite possible I 'm slightly paranoid .
But I 'd say making music is an expression of feelings of helplessness and lack of control that I think a lot of people can relate to . ''
Bellamy told Rolling Stone that this piano ballad says that `` this adventurous spirit we 've created that is now in question , because the planet is saying , ` I 'm only so big and have this much . ' ''
