Winehouse loves Soul music of the '60s and '70s , and it 's likely that this song was inspired by the Billy Paul classic `` Me And Mrs. Jones , '' which is about a couple who are cheating on their partners .
In this song , Mr. Jones would be the man she is having an affair with , and she 's clearly not pleased with him .
The titular Mr. Jones is New York rapper Nas -LRB- real name Nasir Jones -RRB- , who became good friends with Winehouse after being name checked .
He told XXL in 2011 : `` I do n't really remember if -LSB- producer -RSB- Salaam -LSB- Remi -RSB- , who was really close to her , who introduced us , if he told me about it or not .
But I heard a lot about it before I even heard the song . ''
This is possibly the first song to name-check both Slick Rick and Sammy Davis , Jr. .
Slick Rick is a rapper who was popular in the '80s , and Sammy Davis Jr. was a legendary entertainer and part of Frank Sinatra 's `` Rat Pack . ''
He was , as Winehouse sings , a black Jew .
