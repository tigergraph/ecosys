Nail penned this lead single for his second album with Jonathan Singleton , who also wrote the Missouri native 's breakout tune `` Red Light . ''
The song features backing vocals from Nashville singer-songwriter Sarah Buxton .
The song 's music video was inspired by the final scene of the film , The Last Kiss .
Nail initially did n't plan on appearing in the clip .
`` At first , I was not planning on being in the video in any way , shape or form , '' he recalled to The Boot .
`` Then the director Stephen Shepherd came to me and said , ` Man , if you 're going to portray a jerk , to really get the significance , you got ta power up and do it yourself . '
`` Once Nail decided to appear in the video himself , he had to tell his wife the clip was going to contain a half-naked girl .
`` I went home that night and laid out the parameters to my wife , and she sat there very quietly , '' he explained .
`` I told her , ` We 're going to have some stipulations . '
I had planned on not having any sort of interaction with the girl , out of respect for my wife , and I felt that made it intriguing .
Here 's this guy who 's so disgusted by what he did that he does n't even want to look at her , see her , smell her or have any contact whatsoever .
It 's that awkward three minutes where she 's trying to gather her stuff and get out the door without making him feel any worse .
`` Nail told The Boot about the shot of a ring and wallet on the nightstand .
`` That was actually my ring and my wallet , '' he laughed .
`` I credit Stephen for being a great director and seeing my vision .
I wanted to make it as awful as possible .
There 's only one way to really tell a story like that and that 's to tell it in the most brutal way , and we accomplished that . ''
One of Nail 's favorite lines in the song is `` Seven years of good ca n't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring . ''
He explained its meaning to Roughstock : `` It shows how you can spend your whole life having the most beautiful marriage in the world , and all it takes is a slip-up to ruin it all .
It 's a cheating song , but if there is ever a guy you want to root for , it 's this guy , because he is willing to do whatever it takes to make it right . ''
The song was Nail 's first Country # 1 , taking nearly a year to climb to the peak position .
`` When you 're 25 weeks in and you believe in a song , but you 're stuck in the middle of the chart , it 's hard to think you 're gon na get there , '' he admitted , `` and yet , you ca n't think that it wo n't go all the way .
I am a very blessed and lucky man , because not only did my label never give up on me , but so many people at country radio hung in there with us , too . ''
Nail has a celebrity fan in Taylor Swift .
The singer-songwriter tweeted in 2009 that `` Red had become her `` new favorite '' song .
Later she got him to open on her Speak Now tour and Nail recalled to The Boot that during a photo shoot , `` Taylor told me , ' I love ` Let it Rain . '
It 's so good .
You 're on fire !
I 'm so happy for you , ' '' he remembers .
`` I looked right at her and said , ` You mind tweeting that ? '
-LSB- laughs -RSB- . ''
Nail married his longtime girlfriend Catherine Werne on June 6 , 2009 and he admitted to The Boot that since his wedding day , his happy marriage has left him struggling somewhat to write sad songs .
He explained : `` Prior to getting married , most of my relationships ended sort of sour .
I was never short of material to dive back into .
Now I 'm happily married and in a real positive place , and when it came time to start writing for -LSB- my album -RSB- , I was like , ` Man , I do n't have any miserable moments to pull from now .
I think I tapped that well dry . '
I ca n't remember who came up with the phrase ` Let it Rain . '
Jonathan came in with this really cool guitar groove .
It was unlike anything I had ever written and I just loved it .
It 's not a bona fide tempo song but with the guitar , the way it moves , it moves like a tempo song.We started talking about -LSB- the phrase -RSB- ` Let it Rain ' and a scene in the Zach Braff movie , the Last Kiss . '
Zach 's engaged and meets this young girl , they had their moment and -LSB- then he has -RSB- mental anguish .
He tells -LSB- his pregnant fiancée -RSB- about it .
I thought the scene at the end of the movie was one of the most unique I had seen .
The fiancée had thrown him out of the house and his future father-in-law said , ` You have to wait until she 's ready : she may never be ready .
` He goes home and sits on front steps .
Days go by and the weather gets bad .
He sleeps on the steps .
At the end of the movie , there 's no dialogue .
You see -LSB- his fiancée -RSB- crack the door open and you do n't know if she opens it up and throws all his stuff out , you do n't know if she let 's him in , you do n't know if they have a talk.It 's a really powerful scene and I just remember trying to wrap my head around that , to describe how there can be years of good but you ca n't hide one night that you forgot to wear a ring .
Your life can be going just perfectly and everything 's fine and one little mistake , can throw the wrench of all wrenches into it .
I always try to put my mind around something and put myself into it .
That 's what I did -LSB- in writing this song -RSB- .
I thought about what I would do and how I would feel . ''
After Nail 's producer , Frank Liddel , sent Sarah Buxton the demo for another song , he also attached a couple of others including this one with a note saying , `` If any of these stand out to you or really move you , please feel free to take it on . ''
Nail told The Boot what happened next : `` That night I was playing a show somewhere and I got a text that said , `` Sarah came in and sang on ` Let it Rain . ' ''
I was like , `` Whoa , whoa , whoa .
We had not really discussed her singing on ` Let it Rain , ' how did that come about ? ''
And he said , `` Trust me .
When you hear it , you 'll understand .
`` Evidently , she had come in and had the entire arrangement done and smoked it .
It was so unique and unlike anything I had expect to hear .
I 've always been a huge fan of hers , and now looking it back it was such a no-brainer .
I guess that 's why Frank 's the producer and I 'm the singer .
I 'm very thankful after the fact .
It fit her more so than anyone else we could have gotten . ''
Nail co-penned this remorseful cheating song when he first started dating his wife , Catherine .
He told The Boot : `` She was more leery of her friends and family 's reaction of ` what 's he doing ?
What 's he thinking ? ' ''
This song 's 49 week climb to the pole position broke the record for the slowest ever uninterrupted ascent to # 1 .
Chris Young 's cut `` Voices '' took 51 weeks to reach the summit but that total is spread over two releases having peaked at # 36 on its first chart run .
