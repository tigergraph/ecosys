The song features nothing but Heap 's voice in the fore and backgrounds .
She explained why to Electronic Musician : `` I could have gone the route of really processing the vocals to make them not sound like vocals , but I just thought that defeats the object .
I spent quite a bit of time trying to get the best sound out of my voice .
And I spent ages editing them together .
There 's over 100 tracks of vocals on it , and it was absolutely completely doing my head in , just hearing the sound of my own voice for , like , three weeks nonstop .
But I really had this vision , what I wanted it to be .
It was really good fun to write that one.I wrote the song called ` Aha ! '
and I needed something to go after it because I felt like , in the running order of the album , it was n't really working .
So , I thought , I 'm going to listen to ` Aha ! '
and then I 'm going to the first instrument that feels like it wants to be on the record .
I went straight to the mbira and I played a chord .
It started off being something completely different , but I knew I always wanted it to be vocals because I needed an a capella -LSB- track -RSB- on the record .
So the vocals were written really , really quickly , and I went back and kind of perfected the sound of them . ''
Not all of this song was written in the studio .
Heap told Electronic Musician that the `` Da-da , da-da-dah '' part came to her when she was showering .
She added : `` And then I was going , ` Da-da , da-da-dah ' as I was getting dressed and running down to the studio .
A lot of really good ideas happen in the shower .
I think it 's the only time where , because you ca n't be in your studio , you 're not distracted by all the other millions of things you have to do .
Long showers - not very good for the environment , but good for creativity . ''
