Written by guitarist and lead vocalist Peter Perrett , `` Another Girl , Another Planet '' is as good as it got for The Only Ones .
Running to 3 minutes 2 seconds , this uptempo number was the second track on their eponymous debut album .
It was released twice as a single in 1978 , both times on the CBS label .
The first time it was backed by `` Special View '' , the second by `` My Wife Says '' .
Although the song failed to chart , it has been re-released and covered more than once , and is surprisingly well known , although few would go as far as Andy Claps who in reviewing it for Allmusic said it is `` that rare confluence of lyrical , instrumental , and vocal poetry that is so complete , so absolute , that it renders everything else - in , on , above , below , and around it - irrelevant while it plays . ''
