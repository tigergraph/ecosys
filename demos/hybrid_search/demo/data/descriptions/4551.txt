Ellie admitted to Spinner UK that there is a lot of her on Lights , including the questions she asks on this song .
She said : `` I 'm quite questioning , I suppose , but then I answer the questions as well .
In one song I say ` Who are we to be emotional , who are we to play with hearts and throw everything away ? '
so I 'm questioning human behaviour , asking why we act the way we do when we 're in love and infatuated with someone , but later in the song I offer some answers too .
I 'm a hopeless romantic , and I 'm always thinking about what love is . ''
Ellie Goulding told Sky Songs : `` This Love is about cheating on the person you 're with , and questions why any of us do it . ''
