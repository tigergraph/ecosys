Speaking with eMusic , Dave ` Avey Tare ' Portner explained the meaning of this symbolic study of fruit and veg .
`` The simplistic nature of fruit was what I wanted the base the song off of , '' he said , `` that fruit and vegetables are just something that you can just kinda eat , and they flavor themselves .
It 's so satisfying for me to grill vegetables for my girlfriend , because it always ends up being so good .
But then it ended up turning into me thinking about myself and writing a bit more personally .
I think having all these experiences in the past couple years -- I 've gotten out of relationships and friends have passed away , that kind of thing -- I just connected -LSB- those things -RSB- somehow to fruit going away , too .
`` It 's hard for me , '' continued Avey Tare , `` with lyrics , because I just want to have people take what they want from it , and not be so much me trying to shove something down your throat .
The textures and melodies are just as important , if not more important . ''
Josh `` Deakin '' Dibb told AUX Magazine about the writing of the song : `` I think we literally , over the six weeks we were tracking it , stripped ` Applesauce ' down to nothing and rebuilt it at least twice , '' he said .
`` We 've never played the song live the way that it sounds .
It was really like taking little bits and pieces of all these different things that we had tried and editing it to come up with a version that felt like the right thing to us . ''
