When Kid Rock performed this meditation on the end of a relationship at DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston , Michigan on August 13 , 2010 he introduced it as a `` dark '' relationship song that plays like a break-up tune .
During an interview with Billboard magazine the comment was made that this dark and somber song has a misleading title .
Rock replied laughing : `` Audrey Freed and Keith Gattis wrote that and we re-worked it , but it was really their baby .
That 's age , too .
Back in my younger days if a girl really did me wrong and broke my heart I was ` f -- k you .
F -- k you , and get your s -- t and get out of my life . '
Now I guess I 'm a little wiser , maybe more confident in my own skin and it 's , ` hey baby , rock on . ' ''
