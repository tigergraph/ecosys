This love jam is a track from American R&B and soul singer -- songwriter Chrisette Michele 's third studio album , Let Freedom Ring .
The song features the rapper Rick Ross .
Michele previously guested on Rick Ross ' `` Aston Martin Music , '' so when she was looking for someone to contribute a verse to this song , she asked the Florida rapper to return the favor .
`` It was something I was playing around with , -LSB- and I -RSB- put it together , '' she told MTV News .
`` And when it was all done , I said , ` Ross , can you drop a verse ? '
He did , and now he 's a lovebird . ''
