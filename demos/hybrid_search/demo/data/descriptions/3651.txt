Three years in the making , English singer-songwriter James Morrison 's third album , The Awakening , sees him linking up with producer Bernard Butler , the former guitarist in Suede who collaborated with Duffy on her big-selling Rockferry record .
Morrison explained how Butler helmed a clear soulful sound .
`` Bernard was really good at keeping the space in the songs and not letting them get too cluttered with production .
You can hear everything clearly .
Yet he made it sound like a proper record without it being too polished .
It was exactly what it needed.It was quite a full production , but at its core there were only four of us in the room -- drums , bass , Bernard on guitar and me singing .
We did seven or eight live takes of each song , picked the best and worked around that .
We just made sure the vibe was good , and then whatever you put on top is going to sound great . ''
The Awakening was influenced by Morrison 's own steps into parenthood and its title track finds Morrison drawing on his experience of being a father to his daughter , Elsie .
Said the proud dad : `` It 's like I 've just woken up to myself and to what I have to do .
I used to say ` oh , I do n't want kids ' -- and then when it happened it was the best thing ever .
So I wanted to catch that . ''
