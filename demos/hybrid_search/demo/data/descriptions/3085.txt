As their name suggests , many of Murder by Death 's songs have very dark themes .
The band 's cello player , Sarah Balliet , got the ball rolling on this one .
The Lost River is the name of a real river in Southern Indiana , where the band is from .
Their frontman Adam Turla told us : `` We drive by it a lot and we say , ` Oh , lost river . '
It 's a really great name - sort of conjures up great ideas .
So we wrote a song about a person who drowned in that river and their spirit tries to drag down their lover with them , calling them to the river , like , ` Come on , come on in , the water 's fine . '
We do a lot of songs that are sort of supernatural . ''
