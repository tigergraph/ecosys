Green Day lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong wrote this about his father , who died of cancer on September 1st , 1982 .
At his father 's funeral , Billie cried , ran home and locked himself in his room .
When his mother got home and knocked on the door to Billie 's room , Billie simply said , `` Wake me up when September ends , '' hence the title .
This was originally supposed to be on Shenanigans , but Billie was emotionally ready to record it , so it was put onto American Idiot .
-LRB- thanks , Clark - Baltimore , MD , for all above -RRB- The references to the amount of years is like so : When he says 7 years has gone so fast , he is talking about how Sweet Children -LRB- Green Day -RRB- formed almost exactly 7 years after the incident .
And 20 years has gone so fast is an homage to when he wrote this song .
The video was directed by Samuel Bayer , who directed Nirvana 's `` Smells Like Teen Spirit '' video .
Jamie Bell and Evan Rachel Wood starred in the video , which is n't about Armstrong 's father , but more a reflection on the mood in American after the September 11 attacks .
In an interview with MTV , Bayer said this video was `` hands down the greatest thing I 've ever done . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB-
