Speaking to Artist Direct , Asking Alexandria frontman Danny Worsnop admitted the band intended to be contentious with this track .
`` It 's a very blasphemous song , '' he said .
`` It 's very controversial , in-your-face , and offensive .
People have definitely spoken their minds about it .
It 's offended a lot of people .
We wanted to write a really extreme song that 's very controversial .
It 's even a step above how controversial we were already .
It came together like that .
There was no underlying intention or message we were trying to get across other than it was fun to write it . ''
According to Asking Alexandria 's Ben Bruce , `` Morte et Dabo '' is Latin for `` the gift of death . ''
This is the final track on Reckless and Relentless and it concludes with an orchestral coda .
Worsnop told Artist Direct : `` As soon as we wrote the song , we knew the structure of the album .
It always felt like the conclusion mainly because of that whole end section . ''
