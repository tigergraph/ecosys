Sheeran told Q magazine about the laying down of + : `` I started recording in January in a friend 's garden shed in Suffolk .
I wanted to keep that organic lo-fi feel .
I 've got the rest of my life to make an album in a swish studio .
This time round I wanted to stay true to the sound that 's got me this far . ''
The song was used in lingerie company Victoria 's Secret 's Michael Bay-directed Love is Heavenly commercial .
`` I 'm happy having half-naked girls dancing to one of my tunes , '' said Sheeran to AOL Music with a laugh .
`` It actually works .
I do n't know , maybe -LSB- my music -RSB- just suits half-naked women wandering about .
I think it does ! ''
The song 's music video was directed by Emil Nava , and features Isabel Lucas portraying a cupid walking around a city making people fall in love .
The Australian actress is best known for roles as Gwen in the Steven Spielberg World War II miniseries , The Pacific , and as Alice in the movie Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
This song came through late in the recording process .
Sheeran told Q : `` I went in with pretty much all the songs written , but a couple popped out while we were recording .
The last track , ` Give Me Love , ' for example .
That 's an important song for me .
It 's got a more fleshed-out sound , which I think is where I 'm headed in future . ''
Speaking with Artist Direct , Sheeran said this was , `` one of those songs where you get very inspired by a situation and it falls out of you in 20 minutes .
It was a very easy song to write . ''
He added : `` It 's about a relationship that fell apart and you 're asking for it to be put back together .
Most people get to a point where they drink themselves into a dark corner in that situation .
It 's that point of view . ''
