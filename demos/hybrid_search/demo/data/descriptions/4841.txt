The lead single from Hollywood Undead 's Notes From The Underground album is an epic call-to-arms .
Vocalist Johnny 3 Tears explained its meaning : `` The song is about collective resistance .
It 's the silent majority , but we 're using Los Angeles as the backdrop .
Every time we work with Danny , he takes our music to the next level .
He 's willing to go as far outside the box as we are .
As a whole , it 's a good introduction to Notes From The Underground because it encompasses the band idealistically .
Think of it as an ode to our misled youth . ''
The album title is a homage to Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's 1864 novel of the same name , which is a personal favorite of Johnny 3 Tears .
The protagonist of Dostoyevsky 's Notes From The Underground is a bitter , retired civil servant living in St. Petersburg -LRB- the Underground Man -RRB- and the book is spilt into two parts .
The first half finds the Underground Man attacking emerging Western philosophy in some rambling memoirs , whilst its second part is the actual story where certain events occur that lead to a furthering of his consciousness .
The book is considered by many to be the first existentialist novel .
Johnny 3 Tears explained the title alludes to what 's really under the mask : `` We 've maintained an underground identity , '' remarked the Hollywood Undead vocalist .
`` When we write songs , we 're coming from a place people do n't like to look at or talk about openly .
As people get older , they get used to lying .
We have a bond with so many kids because they have a trace of that honesty .
They do n't know how bad some things get yet .
We tell them the truth . ''
