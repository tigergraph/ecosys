This is a track from We All Bleed , the third studio album by South Carolina alternative rock band Crossfade .
The record was the band 's first since signing with Eleven Seven Music and was released on June 21 , 2011 .
Talking about being dropped by Columbia Records after their 2006 album Falling Away and the making of this album , lead singer Ed Sloan told us : `` It took us three years to write the record , so we did n't have any timeline , we did n't have a label breathing down our backs .
So we could take our time with the record and we took our sweet time .
We took three years to write a record instead of 6 months , like most bands have to .
So that plus the ability to actually once again live in a hellhole in your own mind for a year , and then be able to look back and write upon it , and then come out and be successful again . ''
The tune came about after guitarist/keyboardist Les Hall came around with a piece of paper that read `` Dear cocaine , I 'm not your b -- . ''
This gave him the idea to write a song where cocaine was treated as if it 's a person and said `` screw you for messing up our friends ' lives . ''
Sloan told Noisecreep : `` We could have easily just called the song ` Dear Heroin ' or some other drug , but for us we 've had more people we know destroyed by coke than anything else .
I guess you can say it was like some kind of dialogue between me and the drug and it felt really good to tell it to f -- off . ''
Vocalist-guitarist Ed Sloan explained to Noisecreep that the band felt passionate about the song 's subject matter .
`` We 've been a touring band for many years now and we 've seen a lot of things within that world , '' he explained .
`` Now I 'm not saying that cocaine is exclusively used by musicians and people in our industry , but we 've found through our travels that it 's a huge problem within our community .
That drug can do so much damage and we 've seen people we know and love go through that struggle . ''
