This is the second single from American pop rock band Plain White T 's sixth studio album , The Wonders of the Younger .
Frontman Tom Higginson said of the tune in an interview with Alternative Press magazine : `` The story of my life .
I always end up falling for the wrong girl .
No matter how crazy she is or how bad she treats me , I ca n't break my fascination with her .
I just keep coming back for more .
It 's kind of a sad reality , but set to some soaring melodies , it makes for the most infectious song on the album . ''
