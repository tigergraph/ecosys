This song is a protest against the war in Iraq .
It accuses the Bush administration of starting a holy war and trying to build an empire .
Williams also takes a shot at the administration 's policy on torture : `` We 'll kill the terrorizers and a million of their races , but when our people torture you that 's a few random cases . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- Williams said of this song in an interview with The Progressive : `` The best , most solid place to stand as you look at our present situation is on a foundation of history .
The Roman Empire , the British Empire , and the Nazi empire all have things in common .
It 's a cautionary song because empires are doomed .
They become more diffuse , more broke , demagogues rule , and so I was just pointing out some similarities between past empires and what 's going on right now .
They all have had to apply more and more harsh rhetoric of superiority and divine right to justify the building of hegemony . ''
