Frontman and songwriter Conor O'Brien told The Daily Telegraph that this song originally lasted nine minutes and was , `` a big , ambient soundscape that peaked in the middle . ''
O'Brien gradually cut it down to a three minute track , in which , inspired by reading Astronomy and Science writer Carl Sagan , he attempts to put the story of the evolution of human intelligence into a personal perspective .
Speaking with WhiteTapes , O'Brien said he prefers writing pleasing pop songs to tunes with a message .
He explained : `` I think if you focus on trying to give a message , then it 'll be almost the opposite of what it was .
Writing should be a free thing .
It should n't be just a political statement or an opinion , it should be a mixture of lots of different things .
I should try to cut between opinion and emotion , it should be something separate from all these divisions .
What I 'm really trying to do is make something beautiful .
I do n't want to change someone 's opinion , I 'm not into that .
And ` Passing A Message ' is really about DNA , like passing a message on to each other from the beginning of evolution .
There 's no real message in that , it just happens . ''
