The third single by English boy band JLS , from their third studio album , Jukebox samples Bing Crosby 's 1963 classic festive hit `` Do You Hear What I Hear ? . ''
In an interview with Capital FM , JLS 's Marvin Humes insisted that their track is not a Christmas song .
`` It 's very difficult to explain , '' he said .
`` It 's called ` Do You Feel What I Feel ' and we kind of use a tiny bit of ` Do You Hear What I Hear ' from Bing Crosby 's classic Christmas song , but it 's not a Christmas song .
You 'll kind of get what we mean when you hear it . ''
The song was co-written and produced by Julian Bunetta , who has previously worked with the X-Factor winners Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke .
The other co-writers were Canadian country singer and songwriter Tebey Ottoh , who also co-penned Pixie Lott 's UK chart-topper `` All About Tonight '' and John Ryan .
