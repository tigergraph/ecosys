This song celebrating the youth of America was written by Wilde 's brother Ricky and her father Marty .
The Wilde family is from Chiswick , England , which might explain the questionable geography in the lyrics , as the line , `` New York to East California '' would most likely land you in the Mojave Desert - most songs celebrating California refer to the much more hospitable coastal areas .
Marty Wilde -LRB- Kim 's father -RRB- , was a popular performer in England , racking up several hits there .
In 2007 , Jonas Brothers recorded a new version called `` Kids Of The Future '' for the Disney movie Meet The Robinsons .
The song was also covered by Len for the movie Digimon and by No Secrets for Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius .
This was Wilde 's first single .
She racked up 19 Top-40 hits in England , but just one more in the US : a # 1 cover of `` You Keep Me Hangin ' On . ''
She later became a prominent gardening expert in England .
This was featured on the soundtrack of the mostly-forgotten movie Reckless , starring Darryl Hannah and Aiden Quinn .
A cover by The Muffs was used to open the movie Clueless .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA -RRB- A YouTube film of Wilde 's impromptu drunken performance of the song on a tube train in December 2012 went viral .
The singer told The Independent that she was mortified when it became a huge trending video on Twitter .
`` I was with my brother , on my way home after some drinks , and I just started singing , '' Wilde explained .
`` When I woke up the next day it 'd all kicked off on Twitter and I thought , ` Whatever career I have right now , I probably buried it . '
What amazed me was that people thought it was fun and sweet and it 's made me realise that the public have more time for me than I thought . ''
