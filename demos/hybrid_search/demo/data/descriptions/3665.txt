This was a rare ballad for The Stones .
It was the first song they recorded in Jamaica for Goats Head Soup .
Producer Jimmy Miller was not happy with any of Mick Jagger 's four takes .
Jagger refused to do any more , preferring to enjoy Jamaica instead .
Speaking of winter , not many people realize that the winter solstice -LRB- in the northern hemisphere , that 's the shortest day and longest night of the year -RRB- changes slightly from year to year .
Sometimes it 's on the 22nd of December , through usually it 's the 21st .
Blame the wobbly Earth orbit and nature 's general lack of concern for humanity 's needs to have a nice tidy calendar .
Oh , and Mayan calendar fans will fondly remember that the alleged -LRB- very false -RRB- date of the end of the calendar was slated for the 2012 solstice , which just happened to occur at 12/21/12 11:12 PM .
Numerologists practically fainted .
Keith Richards does not play on this track .
Stones guitarist Mick Taylor revealed that composition of this song started out with just Mick Jagger strumming guitar , and then everybody joining in .
That 's Nicky Hopkins on piano duty here .
Hopkins tended to take the slower , ballad-style pieces while Ian Stewart took the faster jam rock , and Billy Preston would take over the piano for the funk and soul numbers.And while we 're on Nickys , Nick Harrison did the string arrangements for `` Winter '' and `` Angie , '' also from this album .
Harrison wrote both classical pieces for string quartets and orchestras , and contemporary rock for the Stones and Joe Cocker .
