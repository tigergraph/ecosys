This song is about former UnderOath vocalist Dallas Taylor dealing with the death of his girlfriend , and how she died before he got the chance to really grow up .
He grew into man after her death and became someone he believes she would be proud of .
He has faith he 'll see her again one day in heaven , and says he 'll be coming home , but he 'll be late .
