This Jake One co-produced track finds Drake examining the duality imposed by fame and his personal limbo : `` Somewhere between psychotic and iconic Somewhere between I want it and I got it Somewhere between I 'm sober and I 'm lifted Somewhere between a mistress and commitment . ''
Happily the song closes on a celebratory note as the successful Toronto MC comes to the realization that `` this is the life for me . ''
We often point out bad grammar in songs , so here we 'll give Drake credit for his proper use of `` furthest . ''
A common mistake is the use of `` farthest '' in this situation , which would indicate a literal distance -LRB- Hawaii is the state farthest away from California -RRB- .
When Drake raps about being the `` furthest thing from perfect , '' he is indicating a figurative distance , and `` furthest '' is correct .
Drake boasts in the third verse about how he 's got his competitors scared that when he 's finished rapping , there wo n't be anything left for them : `` I got 'em worried , like make sure you save a slice for me .
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me . ''
Drake is not only continuing the food metaphor in the second line , but also referencing his cutlery-monikered bodyguard Spoons .
Drake shouted out another of his bodyguards , his longtime buddy Chubby Chub , on the Nothing Was The Same deluxe version bonus track , `` The Motion : '' -LRB- `` And my dog Chubby Chub , that 's my nigga from the way '' -RRB- .
