This is the first single from Wounded Rhymes , the second album of Swedish indie singer-songwriter Timotej Zachrisson , who records under the stage name of Lykke Li .
The NME asked Zachrisson if Wounded Rhymes is a heartbreak record ?
She replied : `` I do n't know , it 's not necessarily about heartbreak .
It 's more about loss and separation .
The loss of innocence , the loss and division of love .
It is about heartbreak in some forms , but it 's more me breaking my own heart and that in itself can be really painful . ''
The song centers around the line , `` I 'm your prostitute , you 're gon ' get some . ''
However , Zachrisson explained in an interview with The Guardian December 13 , 2010 that it is easily misunderstood : `` A lot of people think it 's about sex , '' she said .
`` But it 's about power .
I was reading the Murakami book The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle , where she goes into this guy 's mind by making him fantasize about her , so it 's kind of like power play .
As soon as a woman does anything , they seem to hit a nerve and it 's back to sex .
At least men seem to think that . ''
