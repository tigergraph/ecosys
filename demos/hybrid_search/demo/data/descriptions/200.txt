Drake opens his Nothing Was the Same album with this lengthy , six minute and six second song where he boasts about how long the track is , his ability to change up his flows and the recognition that he can subvert the mainstream Hip-Hop form and still get radio play : `` This is nothin ' for the radio , but they 'll still play it though Cause it 's that new Drizzy Drake , that 's just the way it go . ''
Drake also references the fact that the song is made up of three verses , an outro and no hook .
`` Heavy airplay all day with no chorus , '' he brags .
Drake and Young Money label mate Nicki Minaj had a special connection in the past , even getting married on one track .
However , Drizzy alludes here to a strained relationship with the Queens MC : `` Not even talkin ' to Nicki , communication is breakin ' I dropped the ball on some personal s -- t , I need to embrace it . ''
Drake admitted to MTV News that he was to blame for the breakdown of their friendship , but they subsequently reconciled after he 'd penned the song .
`` That line in Tuscan Leather is n't exactly where I am in my life right now but like a year ago , eight months , seven months ago , it was how I felt .
I 'd done something wrong and I was n't speaking to her , '' said the Toronto MC .
`` I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up , '' he added .
`` I had already solved that issue .
I wrote that a while ago and I kinda felt guilty changing it . ''
Drake stood by his choice to include the lyric on Nothing Was The Same , despite the pair being back on speaking terms .
`` It was a sentiment that I had when I started this album and felt like that 's how it should be , '' he explained .
`` The album should start one place and end in another . ''
This song samples the Whitney Houston tune `` I Have Nothing '' from The Bodyguard soundtrack .
Speaking with Rolling Stone , producer Noah `` 40 '' Shebib explained .
`` It 's a three-staged record - one sample flipped three different ways , with a verse over each beat . ''
Drake explained the creation of the song to Vibe magazine : `` When we were in Atlanta I told 40 , ` Man , just give me some s -- that Dipset would rap on , '' he said .
`` He gave me the beat for the first part of ` Tuscan Leather . '' '
Then Boi-1da sent us some drums and we flipped it , then flipped the end part again .
We had this running joke ; we 'd listen to the song and be like ` Oh , the album is done .
The song was such a journey . ' ''
Tom Ford Tuscan Leather is an expensive cologne .
Drake explained the concept behind the song title to GQ magazine as , `` Tom Ford fragrance that some say smells like a brick of cocaine . ''
The song ends with a Curtis Mayfield quote from the end of a 1987 concert in Montreaux where the soul legend talks about , `` having the same fears , shedding similar tears , and of course dying in so many years , it do n't mean that we ca n't have a good life . ''
Drake gives a shout out to Cappadonna , a quasi-member of the Wu-Tang Clan on this song .
It is one of number of references to the New York crew on Nothing Was The Same .
According to Clan member U-God , the pair have a bit of history .
`` Cappadonna did a song with Drake before y' all even knew Drake .
That 's why -LSB- Drake -RSB- respects certain dudes .
Cap still got the song , he got the record , '' U-God told MTV News .
`` He still got it in the stash . ''
