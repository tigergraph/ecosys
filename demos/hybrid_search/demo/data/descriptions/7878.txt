In the past Stevie Nicks has mainly written alone , but for In Your Dreams she collaborated with ex-Eurythmics member Dave Stewart on seven of the tracks .
`` We wrote the song ` You May Be the One , ' and my eyes instantly opened and I understood why Paul McCartney and John Lennon wrote together - because they each had something the other did n't have , '' explained Nicks to Billboard magazine .
`` And with Dave and me , he had thousands of chords and this amazing musical knowledge , and I had thousands of pages of poetry - and I know six chords .
It was like an amazing little meeting of the minds , and I immediately went , ` Well this is just great ! ' ''
Nicks re-connected with Stewart at a pilot for an interview show with Jimmy Iovine and decided there and then she would ask him to produce her next record .
Nicks then gave Stewart a binder of 40 poems before they started working together .
She told The Ventura County Star how he then developed the songs from her poetry : `` When I got together with him -LRB- Dave -RRB- and asked if he would produce this record , I gave him a book of poetry that had been pulled by my best friend Rebecca out of the last seven to eight years of journals , which was something I would never do .
He came the first day to my house and said , ` All right , I like this poem .
Why do n't we start with this poem ?
` So we had a little recording thing set up hanging over the coffee table and in front of the couch .
He 's sitting across from me and starts playing the guitar .
He just says , ` OK .
Go , ' and I start reciting my poem .
By the end of a half an hour , we had written a great song .
I was completely amazed . ''
