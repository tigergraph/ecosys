Merriweather explained to We7 that this song `` is about drinking too much . ''
Merriweather told the Daily Mirror August 21 , 2009 that he is keeping a check on the heavy alcohol intake , which he sings about on this song .
He recalled : `` I did about 85 shows with Ronson 's revue .
I coined a phrase ` What happened on tour never happened ' - that 's how bad it got .
I was only doing four songs a night , then I 'd come off stage and crack open a bottle of Jameson and be up to seven in the morning .
It 's different now .
I have to hold things down on my own and I 've calmed it down a little bit . ''
This song features the lyric `` Givin ' myself to you is like givin ' myself to a chain saw . ''
Producer and mentor Mark Ronson told Rolling Stone : `` His songwriting is amazing .
His lyrics are not disturbed in a Marilyn Manson sense , but his mind is a bit weird . ''
