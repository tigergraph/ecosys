`` Lonesome Town '' was written by Baker Knight , a behind-the-scenes genius who wrote many hit songs throughout the '50s and '60s for the likes of Perry Como , Elvis Presley , and Dean Martin .
The song has since been covered by Paul McCartney , The Cramps , Jason Donovan , and others .
It also shows up in television shows from time to time , sometimes even playing in a '50s diner with somebody ordering a milkshake , in a shout-out to Pulp Fiction .
Rick Nelson is largely forgotten these days , but he had a total of 36 Top-40 hits ranging from 1957 's `` A Teenager 's Romance '' -LRB- # 2 -RRB- to 1972 's `` Garden Party '' -LRB- # 6 -RRB- .
That one could have a hit-song career spanning three decades , with the last hit scoring only four positions below the first hit , speaks volumes about what a formidable talent Rick Nelson was .
If he had n't had his life cut short in 1985 , who knows what else he could have done?By the way , Nelson 's plane crash was not part of the `` day the music died '' of `` American Pie '' fame , which , after all , came out in 1971 .
Today , this song 's greatest claim to fame is being on the soundtrack to Pulp Fiction , in the scene at Vincent and Mia 's `` date '' at Jack Rabbit Slims when they order the disputed five-dollar-shake .
The song continues to go along with the mood as Uma Thurman puts a point on John Travolta 's grumpiness by asking him `` Could you roll me one of those , cowboy ? ''
, begging one of his hand-rolled cigarettes .
Perhaps he 's been hitting the sauce again , but our commercial research intern insists that this song was also in a Pepsi commercial released before Pulp Fiction .
In it , a man at a Pepsi vending machine in the middle of the desert is desperately trying to get the vending machine to take his dollar , which it keeps spitting back out .
Most of the commercial is taken up by the sound of the bill-validation mechanism buzzing back and forth .
`` Lonesome Town '' is playing over this .
