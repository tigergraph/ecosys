Vocalist Yannis Philippakis told NME this is his favorite track on Holy Fire .
He explained : `` It 's like a classic love song that 's been turned inside out - and when I say inside out I mean violently , like when you turn a squid inside out .
And you know in The Fly when Jeff Goldblum puts the baboon in and it comes out all wrong on the other side ?
Like that , but kind of beautiful for it . ''
