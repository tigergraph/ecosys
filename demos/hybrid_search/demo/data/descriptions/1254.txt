David Bowie -LRB- from the Mail on Sunday June 29 , 2008 -RRB- : `` Mike Garson 's piano opens with the most ridiculous and spot-on re-creation of a 19th Century music hall ` exotic ' number .
I can see now the ` poses plastiques ' as if through a smoke-filled bar .
Fans , castanets and lots of Spanish black lace and little else .
Sexy , mmm ?
And for you , Madam ? ''
Cherie Currie , as played by Dakota Fanning , mimes to this song during a school talent show in The Runaways , a 2010 film about the '70s Rock band of the same name .
Currie was The Runaways ' lead vocalist .
In the same Mail on Sunday interview , Bowie mentions that this `` was written for a wonderful young girl whom I 've not seen for more than 30 years .
When I hear this song she 's still in her 20s , of course . ''
The `` wonderful young girl '' he refers to is most likely the American black soul singer Claudia Lennear for whom Mick Jagger also wrote `` Brown Sugar . ''
A number of authorities have cited her as the inspiration for this song .
