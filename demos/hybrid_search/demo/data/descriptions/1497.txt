This paean to raving started off as a joke based on the fact that dance songs do n't have vocals anymore -LRB- Hence the line `` I like the singer , he 's lonely and strange -- every track has a vocal , and that makes a change -RRB- .
However it then turned into something more heartfelt .
Vocalist Neil Tennant recalled to Pop Justice : `` I can remember us being on the Discovery tour in Brazil , and on the last night of the tour we were all on the dancefloor -- me , our dancers , Chris Lowe , Chris Heath , in this club in either Sao Paulo or Rio , and it was just .
I remember having a very similar experience when we were somewhere during the era when ` Music Sounds Better With You ' was out , which is quite a long time ago ... '' `` You could n't get enough of that record at the time , '' he continued .
`` I remember looking around and everyone was just so happy .
Also with ` Vocal ' , while I did n't do the rave thing in 1988 and 1989 , Chris saw the light then and I was thinking of that from his perspective .
It 's actually a very sincere song . ''
This was the final track on Electric , the Pet Shop Boys ' first independently released album .
It was issued through the duo 's own x2 label , via Kobalt Label Services .
The video was produced and directed by the filmmaker and photographer Joost Vandebrug .
It contains a collection of amateur footage shot at raves in the late 1980s , as well as material filmed in the infamous Ha√ßienda in Manchester .
Electric debuted at # 26 on the Billboard 200 , the Pet Shop Boys ' highest charting album in nearly 20 years .
They last went higher with 1993 's Very , which arrived and peaked at # 20 .
