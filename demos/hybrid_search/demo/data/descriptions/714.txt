American alternative rock band Pixies were a major influence on Cage the Elephant 's sophomore album , Thank You , Happy Birthday and on this amped-up song , vocalist Matt Shultz breaks out his best Frank Black yell to let off steam .
Shultz recalled to MTV News that at the time he was writing for the album , `` I had just broken up with my girlfriend of five years , and I 'd drive around until like 3 or 4 in the morning listening to Doolittle .
It was my therapy , I guess . ''
When Shultz wrote the song he was hanging out with Tiger Merritt and other members of Kentucky Psychedelic rock band Morning Teleportation .
He told Spinner UK how his pals inspired him to pen this tune .
`` Tiger 's the type of guy that every time he touches an instrument , it makes you jealous so I wrote it like on the spot .
They had all these new songs and I said , ` Yeah , I have a new song I 'm working on right now , ' so I just picked up the guitar and started playing it and that 's how that song came about pretty much . ''
