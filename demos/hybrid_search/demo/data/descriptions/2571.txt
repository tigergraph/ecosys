Tim Rice-Oxley says this song is about his friendship with his bandmate , Keene singer Tom Chaplin .
In Q Magazine October 2007 , Rice-Oxley explained : `` With ` Hamburg Song ' I started writing almost about myself .
The first verse I 'd written about my wife , about what she must feel about me sometimes .
And then we got into the studio and it all poured out and turned into a song that was really about friendship .
I did think , ` This is going to be quite awkward . '
But if it 's painful to write or to play , then that 's kind of a job well done . ''
