This song is basically the true life story of George Jones , who overcame drug and alcohol addiction .
Rumor was from backstage at the CMA 's after Alan Jackson broke the format and performed `` Choices '' on the awards show he walked straight out the back door saying , `` That might be it for my career . ''
Of course , it was anything but .
George Jones saw Jackson 's performance on TV at his home , and applauded the effort .
A couple of years later , Jackson used the CMA awards to perform , for the first time , his post 9/11 tribute `` Where Were You . ''
-LRB- thanks , john - jacksonville , FL -RRB- The year this was released , Jones was supposed to perform it on the televised CMA Awards .
The CMA 's wanted George to perform about 30 seconds of the song directly before a commercial break , so George backed out of the performance because he refused to perform only part of the song .
During the live awards show , fellow Country singer Alan Jackson rebelled against the CMA 's and stopped his song `` Pop A Top '' midway and started into the full version of this .
-LRB- thanks , Julian - Oakland , AR , for above 2 -RRB-
