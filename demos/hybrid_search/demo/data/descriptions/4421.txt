Written by Blaze Bayley , Jannick Gers and Steve Harris , this song has very pessimistic lyrics which are referring to a man who is living alone with nothing better to do with his life and no hope for the future .
Around 1993 Steve Harris got a divorce from his wife Lorraine and in an interview with Greek Metal Hammer Magazine said he was not having the best days of his life , both because Bruce Dickinson left the band and his personal problems with his family .
So , it 's easy to say the song presents the psychological situation that Harris had at that period of his life .
