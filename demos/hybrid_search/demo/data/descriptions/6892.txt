This is the second single by American Country music artist Chris Young , from his third studio album , Neon .
The song was released September 12 , 2011 .
The Chris Hicky-directed retro video finds Young portraying a heartthrob gas station attendant .
The sentimental song was Young 's fifth consecutive country # 1 following `` Gettin ' You Home -LRB- The Black Dress Song -RRB- '' , `` The Man I Want To Be , '' `` Voices '' and `` Tomorrow . ''
Young wrote this with Nashville songwriter Luke Laird , whose other credits include Carrie Underwood 's `` Temporary Home '' and `` So Small '' Blake Shelton 's `` Hillbilly Bone . ''
Laird went to college in Murfreesboro , Tennessee , which is Young 's hometown , so he had often heard things about the young singer-songwriter even before he landed a record deal .
However , when Young showed up at Music Row to write with Laird it was the first time that they 'd actually met .
`` Our publishers booked that co-write , '' Laird recalled to Taste of Country .
`` He came over to my studio on Music Row one day .
That was the first time we met , too .
He came in , and I was working on this groove .
He liked it .
As we were talking he had this really cool melody he shared .
He was like man I think it would be cool to write a song called ` You . '
I figured if he thinks it 's cool , it will be cool -LSB- laughs -RSB- ! ''
