This intellectual break-up song showcases Pet Shop Boys ' knack of bringing politics into their music .
The lyric was inspired by David Lodge 's 1988 novel Nice Work , about the relationship between a feminist university teacher and the manager of an engineering firm .
He falls in love with the lecturer and she tells him that love is `` a bourgeois fallacy . ''
Vocalist Neil Tennant told The Sun : `` Putting such a literary phrase into a title for a pop song appealed to me out of bloody-mindedness really . ''
The song quotes the melody line from `` Chasing Sheep Is Best Left to Shepherds , '' which is part of Michael Nyman 's score for the 1982 film The Draughtsman 's Contract .
`` Chasing Sheep ... '' itself takes its material from the Prelude to Act III , Scene 2 of English composer Henry Purcell 's 1691 opera King Arthur and Purcell , not Nyman , earned the co-writing credit for the song .
