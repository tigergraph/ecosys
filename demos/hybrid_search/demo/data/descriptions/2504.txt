Vocalist Tom Meighan told to The Sun May 22 , 2009 that the band see this song as their very own Tarantino soundtrack with its Kraut-rock bass and furious vocals .
He said : `` It 's a Tarantino take on the 21st Century .
There are a lot of angry men out there and Serge 's lyrics show what they 're saying . ''
Guitarist and chief songwriter Serge Pizzorno told the NME June 13 , 2009 : `` It 's a proper British rock 'n' roll song to me , it 's dirty garage rock .
The lyrics are a real vicious spit , really angry .
Tom 's vocals are amazing , ` All you f -- kers ca n't touch me ... ' I could n't sing that , but he delivers it perfectly . ''
This was included on the soundtrack of the football video game FIFA 09 .
