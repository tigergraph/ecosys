Vocalist Jason Butler told Kerrang !
magazine about the inspiration for this song : `` Slightly embarrassingly , I wrote it one night after having shared some rather intimate moments with this girl , '' he said laughing .
`` I woke up , and there was a bunch of things I wanted to say to explain what I was thinking was going to happen between her and I following that intimacy ... But I was a pussy and I was too scared to wake her up .
I just wanted to really explain to her what was going on in my head . ''
So why did Butler chose to spell ` Cult ' with a ` V ' ?
`` To reference older spellings , '' he explained `` There are a lot of eras where they would just use the ` V ' as a ` U. ' It just sort of represents an archaic idea . ''
Butler explained the lyric about God to Kerrang !
`` The idea was me considering women to be somewhat of a deity , '' he said .
`` And while I do find women to be fantastic and beautiful and givers of life , I was looking at it more in the romantic sense , taking over everything in my life and putting these strange , rose-coloured blinders on , as opposed to lenses . ''
