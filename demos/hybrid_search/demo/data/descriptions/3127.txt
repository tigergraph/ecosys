Guitarist Jerry Cantrell told AllMusic that a lot of the songs on The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here started with collected riffs jammed by him and , drummer Sean Kinney .
`` It would be me and him in a dressing room or during a sound check , '' he said .
`` It can be voice messages recorded on a phone .
-LRB- Alice associate -RRB- Baldy will be following us around with a camera , and we 'll be like , ` Hey Baldy , record this ! '
You 'll get home and have thirty or forty fu -- ing two-minute blips , a riff , or whatever .
Then , you wade through that .
`` Every song always starts with a joke title , '' he continued .
That one was called ` Manmouth ' because we were sound-checking at Monmouth .
We started to call it ` Manmouth ' of course -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
That song is cool because it goes in a lot of different places .
It 's basically got four or five things that could be songs on their own put together to make one .
It 's got that creepy Black Sabbath thing in the Geezer Butler-type intro . ''
