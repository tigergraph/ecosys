Duffy in The Sun February 29 , 2008 : `` I had all these ideas in my head and the song really moved , had a snappiness to it .
We recorded it in about an hour and a half .
I remember Jimmy -LRB- Hogarth -RRB- sitting in while I was finishing it off and Eg -LRB- White -RRB- had just left for something .
It was spontaneous and I love that song .
Over the four years , I was having more and more of a say because I was understanding more .
At the start , I left a lot of room for people to bring things to the table .
I needed to find a direction for myself because I did n't really know music , did n't really have any reference points .
Now , I have quite a firm opinion and input .
The whole thing was a learning curve . ''
