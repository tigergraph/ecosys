`` It 's all in there .
Coke , ketamine , MDMA , '' he told The Guardian .
`` I 'm just saying , all the things I tried did n't make me a better person because I 'm already mad when I 'm sober .
On that stuff I was monstrous . ''

`` I was amazing with numbers , '' he told The Guardian .
`` I had a photographic memory , and I hated reading fiction , preferring books on nature and history .
