This song is commonly held to be an attack on singer Pete Doherty , although there is more evidence against this than for it .
Let 's examine : Lyrics : `` I could have put my head in a bucket full of porridge and moaned about the hospital parking scheme , instead of wasting fourteen pounds that I just splashed out on your second album , for that 's what it 's akin to .
And furthermore , you 've got a s -- t arm and that 's a bad tattoo .
`` Pete Doherty 's arm and tattoo are displayed on the cover of The Libertines ' self-titled second album.Lyrics : `` If you 're going to quote from the book of Revelation , do n't keep calling it the book of Revelations .
`` The Libertines ' song What A Waster contains the line : `` The book of Revelations . ''
-LRB- However , it does n't actually quote from it -RRB- .
Lyrics : `` You only busk when it 's Christmas `` Makes no sense when applied to The Libertines , although seems to work with Franz Ferdinand .
Again , probably just a coincidence.Nigel Blackwell , the song 's author , is on record as saying `` the song is absolutely not about Pete Doherty '' and is actually about `` flabby-armed bass players in local pub bands .
Have the decency to develop some biceps , sir ! ''
Given Blackwell 's past form for brazen unambiguity in his celebrity-baiting numbers , he 's probably telling the truth .
If the song was specifically about Pete Doherty it would probably have his name in it , and be a lot more insulting .
