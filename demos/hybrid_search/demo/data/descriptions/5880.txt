This song , in which West is unable to wrench himself away from an ex-lover , was inspired like most of the other tracks on 808s & Heartbreak by his break-up with the designer Alexis Phifer .
They had dated on and off since 2002 , and got engaged in August 2006 .
West told MTV News that this one of his favorite songs that he has ever done .
He explained : `` I do n't even know if people appreciate how good that is yet , but just to have those ominous monk choirs and the snare 's little bleep noise - any producer that hears that should be like , ` That 's incredible .
Listen to that snare , what is that ? ' ''
