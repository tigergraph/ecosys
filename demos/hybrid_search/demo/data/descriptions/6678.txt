Frontman Guy Garvey explained this song to the Manchester Evening News : `` This was worrying about a friend of mine who drinks a bit too much .
And I noticed that I 'm using the phrase ' A Friend Of Mine ' all the way through the song .
That 's what you do when you 're telling somebody about something and you want them to think that you 're talking about a friend , when you 're actually talking about yourself . ''
Garvey told the Manchester Evening News that the lyric about `` growing his very own brambles '' is what happens whenever you do anything to excess .
He explained : `` You become acutely aware that everyone is looking at you , whether they care for you or look down on you .
And the last thing you want is company .
So it 's about addiction , I suppose . ''
