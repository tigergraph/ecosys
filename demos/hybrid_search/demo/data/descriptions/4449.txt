Billy Bragg wrote this song about his lack of DIY skills .
He explained to Chortle that he penned it `` as a way of explaining to my missus why I 'm not much good at putting stuff up or taking stuff down .
I just about manage mowing the lawn and changing the lightbulbs .
Catching spiders as well .
If anyone else in my house learns to do that , I 'm out probably . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Johnny Vegas .
It features his fellow comedians Stewart Lee , Ross Noble , Phill Jupitus , Kevin Eldon and Ricky Grover , as well as actors Neil Morrissey and Sam West .
The pair hooked up after Bragg gave Vegas permission to use his music in his film Ragged , which is about the comic actor Ricky Tomlinson 's fight to overturn his conviction for intimidation on picket lines in the Seventies .
