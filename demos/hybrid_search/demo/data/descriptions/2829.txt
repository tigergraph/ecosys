This song is an attack on people who diss the band .
According to the King of Leon 's website it `` finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band . ''
Frontman Caleb Followill told The Village Voice that this was the track on Only By The Night that took him the least time to write .
He explained : `` One soundcheck we all played our parts .
Like I started playing the melody on the guitar , just kind of found the chords , and literally everyone one at a time jumped in .
Then I sang it , and we finished and I asked my soundman if he recorded it , and he said , ` Yeah , ' and there 's the song . ''
