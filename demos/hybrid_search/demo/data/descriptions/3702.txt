Nick Jonas -LRB- from Shine On Media -RRB- : `` It 's a song that I wrote with the guys from a band that I really like called Leeland .
They came to the studio while we were in Nashville .
It 's basically about those people in your life , that person in your life helping you to be stronger .
Helping you to get your feet back on the ground whenever you fall down sometimes . ''
