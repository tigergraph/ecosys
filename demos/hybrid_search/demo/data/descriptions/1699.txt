This song finds vocalist Liam Cormier distressed at the state of the world today .
He explained to Terrorizer magazine : `` Thinking about how we live in an age that we should be solving world hunger , getting rid of all these problems but instead things are even worse .
I guess it 's that more metal side of things where you just look at the negative things in the world , the idea that we 've been able to discover the atom and things like that but then people use it to their own gains and to destroy . ''
