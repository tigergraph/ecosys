This song is blatantly sexual , with Akon describing a girl who is attracted to him because of his wealth and fame .
Knowing this , he considers taking her back to his place where he can engage her in a sexual act where she will be positioned in a way that she can look back and see him smacking her in the rear .
In October 2006 , this broke the record for biggest jump on the US charts when it leaped from 95 to 7 , mainly because of heavy download sales .
In April 2007 , the record was broken by Shakira and Beyonc√© 's `` Beautiful Liar . ''
Akon mispronounces Lamborghini Gallardo as Ga-la-do instead of Gay-ar-do .
-LRB- thanks , Kye - Tullahoma , TN -RRB- Eminem raps on this .
Other songs on the album feature raps by Snoop Dogg and Styles P .
The music video is a takeoff on the Eddie Murphy/Nick Nolte movie 48 Hours .
Akon plays Murphy 's role of a convict who is released for a short time so he can help solve a crime .
The music video diverges from the movie plot as Akon goes to a club and meets up with Eminem .
