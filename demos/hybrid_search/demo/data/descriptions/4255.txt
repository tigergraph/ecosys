This song was inspired by the death of a soldier while serving in Afghanistan .
He attended the same church as the band 's lead singer and songwriter Mark Hall who said : `` When things that are constants in our lives are stripped away , that 's when we have to know He 's always enough . ''
Hall explained to Billboard magazine that both the deceased soldier ` s son and his wife are also part of his church , in which he is the youth pastor .
He added .
`` We were on the other side of the country and could n't be there for the funeral .
We were on tour and could n't cancel , so we were stuck .
I remember sitting on the bus that night praying with our family and thinking , ' I need to be there for them .
Why ca n't I be there for them ? '
That 's really the message of the song .
You can be there for someone , but there comes a point where Jesus just has to be enough . ''
