This Steve McEwan and Craig Wiseman penned song finds Chesney retreating to a beach where he can think about how `` Time Flies '' when he 's `` sitting in the sun . ''
The singer told CMT that after cutting some of the emotional tracks on Welcome To the Fishbowl , he felt `` a piece of the record needed to exhale , '' which he said this track does .
`` I think that represents me personally , '' he continued , `` and I think it represents all these thousands of people that are going to be out here .
I 've had countless people tell me that what me and the guys do up here is their exhale .
That 's from life , from whatever it is that 's weighing them down . ''
