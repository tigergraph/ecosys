This song features some ethereal vocals from The Kills and Dead Weather frontwoman Allison Mosshart .
Frontman Alex Turner wrote this song about his girlfriend TV presenter Alexa Chung .
The lyric `` If it 's true you 're gon na run away/Tell me where , I 'll meet you there , '' refers to Turner relocating to New York after Chung landed her own shown on MTV .
He told Mojo magazine September 2009 : `` It 's the most honest song on the record .
Some songs are disguises for one little thing that you wan na say .
Just to tell someone something .
Others are more constructed , formulaic and traditional .
Show-offy . ''
He added whereas this song , `` is not so considered .
Visceral .
Is that the right word ? ''
Q magazine suggested that the closing line - `` I 'd like to poke them in their prying eyes '' represents a less laid-back attitude to being famous and in love .
After consideration , Turner replied : `` Well , I think ... yeah ... you do poke prying eyes .
By just getting on with it . ''
This is one of producer Josh Homme 's favorite tracks on Humbug .
He told Mojo magazine September 2009 : `` It starts to grind at the end , gives me chills even now , he 's almost like a disgusting John Lydon character . ''
Turner admitted to Q magazine , December 2009 , that when he wrote this he was `` smitten ... though there 's an uncertainty to the song . ''
The frontman added that initially , he decided that the lyric was too personal and so recorded a version with Mosshart singing the vocals .
`` Then I just thought , F -- ing grow up , like . ''
