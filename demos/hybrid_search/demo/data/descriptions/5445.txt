About.com asked Cagle which song on the album means the most to him .
The Country singer replied : `` The song that means the most to me would probably be ` Change Me . '
It 's something that when I sing it , it 's what I want .
It takes something special to get there .
It would be a pretty dull life for me to wake up at forty and be finished .
I hopefully have forty more years .
I think that song holds a place in my heart that none of the others do . ''
