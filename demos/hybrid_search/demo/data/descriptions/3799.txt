Bass guitarist Randy Armstrong explained the song 's lyrical content to NewReleaseTuesday : `` The lyrics say , ` You will be the death of me , ' and the ` you ' is actually referring to yourself - you 're having a conversation with yourself .
This song describes a moment of self-reflection , when we see how our involvement in the things that are n't good for us and how our hypocritical behavior has led us down a path we never wanted to take .
As a result , we end up ruining things for ourselves . ''
Armstrong told NewReleaseTuesday that the band `` used twins to symbolize two opposing forces '' in the song 's music video .
He explained : `` In it , we see the positive side of things being chased by the negative side of things , and in the end there 's a battle .
The battle does n't seem to resolve itself in the video .
That 's because we will face struggles in our lives , even though we do find resolve in certain situations . ''
