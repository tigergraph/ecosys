This is a track from Drowning Pool ' s fifth album , their first to feature former The Suicide Hook singer Jasen Moreno .
`` The question I am most often asked is ` What ' s life on tour like ? '
This song is my best description of a typical day on the road , '' the band ' s bassist Stevie Benton told Noisecreep .
The video was filmed in a couple of different seedy locations in downtown Dallas , Texas .
Guitarist C.J. Pierce noted to Billboard magazine that the song is one of `` lighter moments '' on Resilience .
`` It 's more of a party song , which we 've never really done before , '' he said .
`` People ask us what it 's like to be on the road , and we say every night on the road is like Saturday night -- the doors open up , everyone 's drinking and having fun , usually what you do on a weekend even if it 's Wednesday or whatever .
It 's something new and different , but you look at , like , Led Zeppelin ; they would bring some new style every time they made a record .
And -LRB- ` Saturday Night ' -RRB- is fun to play live , man .
We go from that to ` let the bodies hit the floor ' and it really gets people going . ''
