This sing-a-long song finds Turner proclaiming in the chorus , `` There is no God !
So clap your hands together ! ''
The atheist singer-songwriter denied in an interview with NME it was his attempt to kill off religion .
He explained : `` I 'm not the biggest fan of the concept of theology , but at the same time it 's not my intention to lead some kind of uprising to try to wipe out anybody who believes in God .
The inspiration for writing that song was when I was on tour a couple of years ago and we were closing the set with a gospel tune , ` May The Circle Be Unbroken . '
It 's a beautiful song and I enjoyed singing it , but I thought would n't it be nice if there was a song in the canon that put the opposing view but still had the same sense of joy ?
There are atheist songs out there , but they tend to be written by black metal bands and they 're full of hate and anger and bitterness . ''
