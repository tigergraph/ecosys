Keyboardist Aaron Gilbert told ilikemusic.com about this song : `` It 's the most up sounding song you 'll ever hear but its actually about OCD -LRB- Obsessive-compulsive disorder -RRB- .
Greg 's -LRB- Aaron 's brother , who is the band 's lead singer and guitarist -RRB- got OCD and he wrote about it and I think people tend to , when they are writing about subject matter like that , tend to write maudlin songs and it does n't have to be like that .
We write about things like that in an up sounding way ... so you never really know ! ''
