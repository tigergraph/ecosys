This was written by KT Tunstall , who was the only female songwriter to contribute to The Performance , the concept album devised for and about the Diva by producer David Arnold .
It started life as a folk song called `` Nice Boys '' , and underwent the biggest transformation of all the songs of the project , becoming more of a cabaret number .
Shirley Bassey herself said she liked the song but it was one that nearly did n't get done : `` it was not me at all , and I had to make it me '' .
She altered the lyrics to give it a slightly sensuous feel .
