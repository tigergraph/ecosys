Tracy Chapman told The Guardian October 31 , 2008 about the song 's washed-up protagonist : `` I imagine her in a smoky club , and she 's stumbling around , trying to tell anyone who 'll listen about what she thinks of as her glorious past .
She walks around most of the day in some kind of negligee , with tattered hems .
Her hair is done but it 's a little loose .
Makeup , but slightly smudged lipstick . ''
Chapman denied to The Guardian that this song is about a little-known side of herself and added , `` Someone asked what I was arrested for , because they picked up on the ` They read me the rights ' line -LSB- in the song -RSB- , but I was not in jail ! ''
