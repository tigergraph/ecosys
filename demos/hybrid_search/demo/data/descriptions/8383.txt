This explosive slice of Country-Rock finds Underwood singing of the ancient god of love , Cupid , dispensing with his bow and arrow and moving onto firearms .
The singer penned the song with the pair of Josh Kear and Chris Tompkins , who also wrote the album 's title track .
When Carrie performed this romp during a Live on Letterman mini concert , she admitted that it 's a little out of character and her husband , Mike Fisher , questioned it the first time she let him listen to the tune .
In Roman mythology , Cupid was the god of love , his name coming from the Latin `` cupido , '' meaning `` desire . ''
In the Greek version he was named Eros and seen as one of the primordial gods .
These days Cupid is frequently shown in paintings and sculptures shooting his bow to inspire romantic love , often as an icon of Valentine 's Day .
Brad Paisley provides the guitar licks to this fiddle footstomper , as he and Underwood reconnect after their duet , `` Remind Me , '' which hit # 1 on the country music charts in the fall of 2011 .
The pair also frequently co-host the CMA Awards .
Underwood told Letterman that she had to pull out every hunting reference she 'd ever heard her husband make while writing the lyrics : `` I 'm like , ` Remington ?
I think that 's a gun , '' she said .
`` Yeah .
Yeah , yeah , let 's say that .
Kevlar ?
What is that ?
I know that 's something , something important , ' '' she told the crowd .
`` But the other writers had to teach me what the word ` barrage ' meant .
I was like , ` What is that ?
Is that a word ?
You guys are making crap up , trying to stick it in a song . '
But I learned something new , so that was fun . ''
