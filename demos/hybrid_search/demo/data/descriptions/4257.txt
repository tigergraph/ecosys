This song was written by the Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sande -LRB- `` Heaven '' -RRB- , her frequent collaborator Naughty Boy and Nashville songwriter Josh Kear -LRB- `` Need You Now '' -RRB- .
Susan explained what this song means to her : `` This song reminds me about New Year 's and the resolutions we make but really ca n't keep .
You always say that but never really follow it through .
It looks back at the old year but it 's also a very optimistic song as it looks forward and gives you an inner strength .
This will be the year that I show them what I can really do and what I 'm made of and make this album really work .
That 's the personal message I got through this song .
It 's definitely an optimistic song . ''
