This song was inspired by a conspiracy theory website called Rigorous Intuition that vocalist Andrew VanWyngarden became engrossed in .
He explained to NME : `` This Canadian guy who does it just goes way too deep on the most messed-up stuff that 's happening .
I enjoy reading it , but I hope it 's not really happening because it 's the most sadistic , awful stuff .
You can go to this blog and spend a couple of days reading and just crying . ''
The song 's music video stars Michael K. Williams , who is best known for playing Omar in The Wire .
He portrays The Plant Hunter , a criminal who turns genetically modified plants into drugs .
