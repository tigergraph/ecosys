English singer-songwriter Laura Marling opens her fourth album , Once I Was an Eagle , with this hesitant strum on which she tells her man , `` Would n't ask you even to behave for me .
I know there 's no hope in Hell ... '' The song is the first of a four part salvo in which each track seamlessly flow into one another , much like `` Do n't Ask Me Why '' and `` Salinas '' on Marling 's previous album , A Creature I Do n't Know .
Its success , she told Radar magazine , was largely due to her producer , Ethan Johns , who had an instinctive grasp of the album 's bigger picture .
`` I had written this 16-minute track that was quite definitively four different things , '' she said .
`` Ethan took notes as we ran through it ; I 'd give him instances of places where I wanted certain things , but he had this wide picture of the record that I did n't have .
So when it came to the arrangements , he wanted it to feel like each of the instruments had this character to them .
I did n't really realise that until the end of the process !
Listening to it later , he had brought out things in the songs that I 'd forgotten were in there . ''
