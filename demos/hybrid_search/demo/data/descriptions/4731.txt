This is the most personal track on singer-songwriter and One Tree Hill actress Kate Voegele 's third album .
The Ohio native explained to AOL Music : `` I wrote it when I was moving out to California and when I was having to make a lot of big decisions in my life .
The song is about how even though sometimes you just want to be six-years-old again and ` make sandcastles ' instead of making big decisions , at the end of the day , music can bring you through anything .
Music and songwriting was really what brought me through the challenges I went through during that time . ''
