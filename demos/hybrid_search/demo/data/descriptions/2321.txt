This song portrays the heroin problem in Baltimore , Maryland .
In this song , 50 Cent is writing and singing as if he were the actual drug heroin .
The song is meant to be listened to as if `` heroin '' were telling the story .
This song also portrays a love relationship with a girl similar to a relationship that someone would have with heroin .
He mentions , `` If you give birth , I 'll already be in love with your kids '' meaning that if a heroin addict uses heroin while they are pregnant the baby will be effected too .
