This song finds Miller singing about the blue slide in Frick Park mixed with the sounds of children playing outside .
The Pittsburgh native uses the playset to represent a sense of normalcy now that he 's achieved fame .
`` They thought the money should 've changed it / Slide still blue , why the world keep trying to paint it ?
/ When life around you changes , try to keep your sameness , '' he croons .
Miller explained to MTV News : `` No matter what happens in life , no matter where you go , where you 're off to , what happens with the park , that slide will always be blue .
That will always be Blue Slide Park no matter what .
You can go to New York and live for 10 years and become a huge business mogul and then come back to the ` Burgh and no matter how much money you got , that slide is still blue . ''
The actual English Lane is an adjacent street to Blue Slide Park .
Having almost completed his debut album , Miller was walking to the park to get some last-minute inspiration .
He told MTV News : `` I walked by and was like , ` English Lane would be an ill title for a song , that 's how I wan na open the album , with a song called ` English Lane , ' ' because that 's how you walk up to Blue Slide Park . ''
Frick Park is located two blocks from Pittsburgh 's Taylor Allderdice High School where the rapper used to attend .
Mac 's Rostrum Records labelmate Wiz Khalifa is another famous former pupil of the school .
