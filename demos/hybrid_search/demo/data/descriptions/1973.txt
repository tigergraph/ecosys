Alex Turner told Uncut Magazine that he wrote this breezy love song about meeting girls in pubs who remind him of the one he 's trying to forget , `` one morning , quite quickly . ''
He added : `` There 's something to be said for writing in the morning .
At other points in the day you 're a bit more defensive .
I saw it as a challenge to write something in a major key , but that was n't cheesy . ''
Wry Yorkshire folk-pop legend Jake Thackray was an inspiration on this song .
Turner said : `` The way he pronounced things was hilarious . ''
This was released as the second single from Humbug with new songs `` Catapult '' , `` Sketchead '' , and `` Fright Lined Dining Room '' available across its release formats .
This song was helmed by Favourite Worst Nightmare producer James Ford and penned by Turner after most of Humbug had already been recorded at the Mojave Desert town of Joshua Tree .
He explained to Uncut Magazine : `` We did a little Australian tour and stepped away from the album for a minute .
It became apparent that I still needed to write a bit , so we booked another session with James .
Although we still had Alain -LRB- Johannes , engineer -RRB- in the studio to keep it linear . ''
Coincidentally perhaps , Cornerstone is the name of a prominent counselling centre in the Arctic Monkeys ' home city of Sheffield .
