Steel Magnolia is the boyfriend-girlfriend team of Joshua Scott Jones and Meghan Linsey .
They wrote this song for their debut album with Steffon Hamulak .
In our interview with Joshua Scott Jones , he told us : '' ` Eggs Over Easy , ' that was just fun-loving , a real easy tongue-in-cheek type song .
We actually went over to our buddy 's house - Steffon , he 's a writer in Nashville .
And we were just making breakfast .
It was Sunday morning and I picked up a guitar and started playing the chords .
And they were like , ` We do n't want to write a song . '
I said , ` Well , you 're going to . '
-LRB- laughing -RRB- And he said , ` Dude , how do you want your eggs ? '
And I just started spoutin ' off , -LRB- singing -RRB- ` Cooking you breakfast on a Sunday morning , ' and then we turned it into a relationship twist , because that 's what we do .
-LRB- laughing -RRB- And here 's an interesting little fact : the dogs ' names ... we were actually over at his place and his dogs ' names were Benny and Beavis .
And so the original line was ` Benny and Beavis layin ' there beggin ' .
We got the K9 crew , y' all , you know what I 'm sayin ' . '
But we changed it to Patty and Rufus , which are the name of our dogs .
Just kind of silly , but ... ''
