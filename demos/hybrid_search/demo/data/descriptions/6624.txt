This was written by Jim Lauderdale , who recorded the song on his 1991 debut album Planet of Love .
Strait recorded it for the 1992 movie Pure Country , where he stared as a Country singer looking to get back to his roots .
Straight also recorded Lauderdale 's `` Where the Sidewalk Ends '' for the soundtrack , and has recorded many more of Lauderdale 's songs since , including `` What Do You Say To That '' and `` Twang . ''
In our interview with Jim Lauderdale , he told the story behind this song : `` I was reading this book about Graham Parsons , and there 's this story by this lady , Pamela Des Barres , telling about how he was playing George Jones ' records for people that had never heard him before , and he started crying , and he said that 's the king of broken hearts .
He 's one of my favorites , so I wrote that song as a tribute to Graham and George Jones . ''
