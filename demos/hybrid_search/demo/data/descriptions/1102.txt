Was this the first ever Speed Metal song ?
Accept lead singer Udo Dirkschneider thinks so , as do a legion of other Metal musicians who followed , including Charlie Benante , who got his gig drumming for Anthrax by playing this song in audition.While The Scorpions were the most popular German Rock band , Accept was probably the most influential .
Led by frontman Udo Dirkschneider , they broke new ground with their blistering tempo .
`` Stefan Kaufmann -LSB- Accept 's drummer -RSB- came up with just a fast song , '' Udo told us .
`` The really funny thing was in the beginning , we said , ` Bah !
No , we can not play songs like this . '
But we did n't know that we were exasperating `` Speed Metal . ''
So that was completely new . ''

Part of a quirky German Folk song `` Ein Heller und ein Batzen '' -LRB- English translation : `` A Farthing and a Penny '' -RRB- was incorporated into this track , providing quite a contrast of styles .
Since the Speed Metal rule book had yet to be written , there was no reason you could n't incorporate a Folk song into it .
`` Sometimes you have crazy ideas , and in the end it works out very good , '' Udo told us .
