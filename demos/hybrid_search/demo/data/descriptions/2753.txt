No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stefani sang on this , making it into a duet running 1:57 .
She used to go out with Sublime lead singer Brad Nowell .
On the Sublime : Stories , Tales , Lies & Exaggerations DVD , Stefani explained that Nowell wrote this in the studio and did his vocal in one take .
-LRB- thanks , Vanessa - Covina , CA -RRB- This is based on a popular Jamaican song called `` She 's Mine '' by Dancehall singer Barrington Levy .
Sublime recorded it as a tribute to Levy , changing the lyrics but keeping the music pretty much intact .
After Sublime lead singer Brad Nowell died , their bass player and drummer formed the Long Beach Dub All-Stars , and recorded a version of this song with Levy .
-LRB- thanks , mitch - colton , CA -RRB- An acoustic version appears on Bradley Nowell & Friends , released in 1998 .
It 's just Brad and a guitar .
This was recorded before either Sublime or No Doubt were famous .
Both groups rose to fame in the mid - '90s on the Southern California punk scene that also featured Green Day and the Offspring and was fathered by the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
Robbin ' The Hood was a hit with college radio , but Sublime did n't break through to the mainstream until their next album in 1996 .
In October of 2008 this song was covered by Rome Ramirez for YouTube 's `` Rawsession , '' featuring Sublime bassist Eric Wilson .
