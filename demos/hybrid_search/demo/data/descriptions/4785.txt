Rosa Parks is a black civil rights activist from Alabama famous for refusing to give up her seat on a bus .
In 1955 , while riding the bus home from work , the driver ordered her to move to the back of the bus so a white man could have her seat .
She refused and was arrested .
This led to outrage in the black community , who boycotted public transportation in the city of Montgomery .
It was a turning point in the US civil rights movement , as after a year of boycotts , segregation on busses was ruled unconstitutional .
During the boycotts , Martin Luther King Jr. emerged as a leader in the black community , and was praised for his tactics of peaceful civil disobedience .
Parks sued Outkast over this , claiming it exploited her image .
The case was settled in 2005 , with Outkast and their record company agreeing `` To enlighten today 's youth about the significant role Rosa Parks played in making America a better place for all races . ''
Parks was 92 when the case was settled .
The song is about the entertainment industry .
Parks is not actually mentioned in the lyrics and has nothing to do with the song , but she is referred to in the chorus of `` Move to the back of the bus . ''
The harmonica solo is by Andre 's stepfather , Pastor Robert Hodo .
