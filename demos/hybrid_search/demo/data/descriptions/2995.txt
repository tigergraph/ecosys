This is the closing track from British alternative rock band White Lies ' sophomore album Ritual .
Drummer Jack Lawrence-Brown told NME : `` There 's not really any slow songs until we get to this one , and we definitely felt the record needed that a moment of reflection .
It 's quite a daring song .
It 's dangerous territory . ''
