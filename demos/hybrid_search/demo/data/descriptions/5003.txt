It was one of two tracks on Allsopp 's demo , which got him signed up by Chas Smith of Madness , who had set up his own label .
Allsopp told The Independent August 28 , 2009 that he likes to think this song highlighted that they shared a similar outlook on life .
He explained : `` The song was about the vulnerability you feel trying to be a man , which I was fed up with at the time and he got that .
There are Madness songs about that too .
He listened to `` Geezer '' seven or eight times , then we went to the pub and had a couple of pints and that was that .
We were kindred spirits and I still speak to him some times . ''
