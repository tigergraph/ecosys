The song is about feeling captive in a world where wars and conflicts rule supreme .
It promises peace and harmony if everyone could just learn to live side by side .
-LRB- thanks , John - Auburn , WA -RRB- Timmy Curran is known internationally for his trademark big-airsurfing maneuvers .
His style is all his own , and in 2004 he wasranked 6th in the world on the CT Tour .
Surfing was Timmy 's first passion , but he has been dabbling in music since the age of 16 , when he began writing his own songs .
He was too nervous to ever perform his songs for anyone until about 10 years later , when , he says , he found the answer to his prayers : to be able to sing a song without embarrassing himself or his friends .
With positive feedback and support from his wife and brothers , he began writing songs in earnest .
The bathroom was his recording studio at the time .
His friend Josh Landen , who was putting together a surf documentary entitled Flow -LRB- about Al Merrick , one of the best-known surfboard shapers in the world -RRB- , heard Timmy 's mini-disc/bathroom recording of his original song `` Horses On The Range , '' and requested permission to use it in his film .
Timmy was ecstatic .
