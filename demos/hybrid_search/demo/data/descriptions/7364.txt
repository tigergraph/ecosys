Howie D told About.com that this is his favorite track on This Is Us .
He said : `` It 's an uptempo song .
It was done by Claude Kelly who is right now really doing well in the states .
He did the `` Circus '' song for Britney Spears as well as he did Kelly Clarkson 's first single -LRB- `` My Life Would Suck Without You '' -RRB- and he is just on fire as well .
It 's an uptempo song a la Chris Brown 's `` Forever '' Ne-Yo 's `` Closer . ''
Kind of like that Euro-dance pop R&B feel . ''
