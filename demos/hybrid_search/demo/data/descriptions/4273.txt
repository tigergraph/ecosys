This was released as the third single from Daybreaker , the fifth full-length studio album by the British metalcore band Architects .
` Alpha ' is the first letter of the Greek alphabet and ` omega ' the last .
The term alpha and omega comes from the phrase `` I am the Alpha and the Omega '' , applied to God in the Book of Revelation -LRB- verses 1:8 , 21:6 , and 22:13 -RRB- .
The title was used to demonstrate that He is the eternal Lord and ruler of the past , present and future.The words ` alpha ' and ` omega ' do not feature in the song 's lyrics , instead Sam Carter is singing of no eternal Heaven or Hell rather , `` One life .
One chance .
The world in front of me . ''
Guitarist Tom Searle explained the lyric `` No ups , No Downs .
I 'll find peace buried in the ground '' to Kerrang !
`` It 's about atheism , '' he said , `` but I 'd say I 'm now more open to ideas regarding spirituality than I was .
It 's not spirituality that grips me , though - it 's religion .
For me , this is about accepting that there is no Heaven or Hell .
There 's no ` afterlife ' in the mainstream religious sense .
There 's surely nothing more peaceful than absolute nothingness . ''
