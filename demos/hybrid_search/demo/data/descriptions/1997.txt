After The Guillemots second album , Red , failed to duplicate the success of their debut release , there was a certain amount of pressure regarding Walk The River .
Recorded in a converted country manor in the mountains of North Wales with a reduced budget , the British indie rock quartet found themselves influenced by both their situation and location .
This song , for instance , begins with the line : `` Wake up , nothing is where it should be , why do these things happen to me ? ''
Frontman Fyfe Dangerfield explained to The Independent : `` It felt like someone waking up abandoned in outer space .
Not in a sort of prog-concept way , but we tried to think what that would feel like -- to come to and everything you know is gone , but you 're certain you have a home somewhere and the only thing that keeps you going is this hope that you 're somehow going to get back there . ''
