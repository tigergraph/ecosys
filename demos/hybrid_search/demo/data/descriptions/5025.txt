This song was written by Dan Peek , one of the 3 founding members of America .
He left the band in 1977 after pledging to God that if successful with his music , he would dedicate his life to Jesus Christ , which he continues to do to this day .
The lyrics are Peek 's advice to a lost and lonely girl who loves life in the fast lane but feels emptiness within .
He tells her , `` Do n't cross the river if you ca n't swim the tide , '' meaning that if she is going to live life for her own fleshly reasons , she will likely be unhappy and do not expect otherwise .
He invites her to accept Jesus by reminding her that `` If you want , you can ride my train and soon forget the reason that you 're leaving '' - leaving the old life behind , and that `` You 'll lose yourself but then some time , maybe even save yourself some grievin ' '' - you 'll leave certain pleasures behind but soon forget about them and save yourself many heartaches and hours of loneliness .
