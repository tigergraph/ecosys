Guitarist Dean DeLeo commented to Musicradar.com : `` Basically , it 's a country song presented in a rock format .
We seem to be able to do that without really trying.But now that I say that , I 'm reminded that I was listening to a bit of country music before we made this record .
There 's two cats who just blow my mind : Jimmy Bryant , who was a fast Tele picker , and Speedy West , who played pedal steel .
The recordings they did in the late '50s and early '60s were unreal.I am not putting myself in their league at all , but they did inspire me quite a bit , as does Jimmy Page , of course - I do a bit of him in the solo . ''
Dean DeLeo told Artist Direct : `` I like where the band went with ` Hickory Dichotomy ' -- this country-honk-big-front-porch-foot-stompin-back-bunny-sort-of-thing -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
I really feel like I was able to branch out a little bit more on this record and take the liberty to solo a little more with keeping a song at three minutes long .
I do n't know that fans would really appreciate us doing Tales from Topographic Oceans at this point in our career -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
Maybe one day soon though , I hope . ''
