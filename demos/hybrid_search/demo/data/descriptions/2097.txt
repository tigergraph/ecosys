This song was inspired by Angaleena Presley 's brassiere -LRB- which the Annies nickname `` Mother Bra '' -RRB- and Miranda Lambert 's Christian cowgirl friend Tina .
Presley told Billboard magazine the story of the song : `` I had never done anything like this and our stylist was like , ` you 've got ta go get you a good , durable new bra , ' 'cause I have huge boobs , '' she recalled . ''
So I got this hideous , four-hooked , harness , this beige thing that my boobs are wrangled in at all times .
But Mother Bra has a mind of her own .
Like we were in Mexico and woke up and she was floatin ' on top of the pool .
`` Mother Bra has all these adventures , '' she continued , `` and she winds up in the weirdest places .
So Tina was on the road with us , and ol' Mother Bra was just laid out on the stove , she walked through there and picked it up and said , whose is this ? '
And I grabbed it and said , ` Do n't talk about it , Tina , ' and we started sayin ' that about everything .
`` But the song turned out to be about girlfriends , '' she concluded , `` going out the bar , havin ' each other 's backs , ` get over it girl , there 's more people out there . '
So it started out about Mother Bra and it ended up being about good ol' girls like Tina , salt of the earth , you 've just got ta have their backs . ''
