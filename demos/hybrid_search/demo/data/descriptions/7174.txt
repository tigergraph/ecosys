This was the first Top 40 hit for TLC .
It introduced the group and explained who represented each letter : Tionne `` T-Boz '' Watkins , Lisa `` Left Eye '' Lopes , and Rozonda `` Chilli '' Thomas .
The video made sure to introduce each singer .
When each girl sang her part , her name flashed on the screen .
Like many of their songs , T-Boz sang the lyrics , Left Eye did the rap , and Chilli sang on the chorus .
This is not the same song as the Temptations classic of the same name .
In that song , a man swallows his pride and begs his girl to come back to him .
In this , the girls state that they are not afraid to ask a man for sex .
This was written largely by Dallas Austin , except for Left Eye 's rap which , like the majority of what she sang , she wrote herself .
-LRB- thanks , janean - cincinnati , OH -RRB- This contains samples of `` Escape-ism '' -LRB- James Brown -RRB- , `` Jungle Boogie '' -LRB- Kool & the Gang -RRB- , `` School Boy Crush '' -LRB- AWB -RRB- , `` Fly Robin Fly '' -LRB- Silver Convention -RRB- , and `` Take Me to the Mardi Gras '' -LRB- Bob James -RRB- .
This is about sex .
They made it clear , however , that they advocated safe sex , by prominently displaying condoms .
Lopes wore one over her left eye in their early days .
It took a long time for radio stations to figure out what this was about , but when they did , a lot of them censored the line `` 2 inches or a yard , rock hard or if it 's sagging - I ai n't too proud to beg . ''
The line was part of Left Eye 's rap .
The Ooooooohhh ... On the TLC Tip album sold over 3 million copies .
Their next one sold 5 million , but TLC still managed to go broke and had to file for bankruptcy in 1995 .
Their contract paid them only 7 % of revenue from album sales , which was n't enough to cover their expenses when split 3 ways .
