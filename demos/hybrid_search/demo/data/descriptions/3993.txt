This sparse piano ballad is a straightforward breakup song , a rarity for Spektor , who is better known for her stream of conscious lyrical content .
Speaking with American Songwriter magazine , producer Mike Elizondo , called it , `` one of the most beautiful vocals I 've ever been a part of capturing .
It really felt like she was laying her heart out there .
She was coming clean with how she 's feeling in that particular moment .
It 's pretty special when you can get a performer like her to pull that off . ''
The intimate video was directed by Margo Weathers , and is a combination of animation and live action .
It uses handmade paper collages designed by Bic Owen , which adorn Spektors ' costumes as she sings to camera .
They were animated in stop motion by The Academy in Seattle .
