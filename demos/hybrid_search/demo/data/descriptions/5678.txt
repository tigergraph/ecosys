This is the opening track from British rapper Speech Debelle 's second album , Freedom Of Speech .
The guy manning the controls on the record is Kwes , a young South London producer who had already boasted production for DELS and a record contract with Warp .
The song was made available as a free download in the run up to the release of the album .
Speech described the song , as being , `` all about virtual instrumentation and an ode to Kwes the producer .
For the writing stage of the album he would take out his laptop and midi-USB keyboard and that would be it .
We 'd start working and I could n't believe what we could do with so little equipment . ''
