Jessie spent time in London 's Great Ormond Street Hospital at the age of eleven being treated for an irregular heartbeat .
Inspired by a sad incident during her stay there , seven years later she wrote her first ever song , which later found its way onto Who You Are .
She recalled in an interview with The Independent December 10 , 2010 waking up in the middle of the night to see a little boy in an adjacent bed praying , and her mother explaining that he was having an operation the next day and was asking God to save him .
Jessie continued : `` He died the next day so I said to my mum ` but God did n't save him ' .
I was so angry and it really confused me .
I always wanted to write a song about the experience , but I knew I had to be of an age where it was n't tacky or depressing and had a lightness to it . ''
The version that appears on Who You Are is a live recording .
Jessie explained to The Sun : `` We recorded and reproduced it so many times but for some reason it never felt right , like it was missing something .
I think the live recording at Scala in London with Ben on guitar was perfect .
It joins ties together all the pieces in my journey . ''
