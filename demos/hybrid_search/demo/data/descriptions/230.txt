Lambert co-wrote this song with Ashley Monroe and her boyfriend Blake Shelton .
She explained : `` This one definitely has a retro feel .
Ashley had the idea and came down to my house in Texas a couple years ago .
I had already cut my last album , and she was n't cutting at the time , so it fell by the wayside for a while .
But I always felt it was a brilliant analogy .
Blake had come to the studio to hear a few songs , and late that night he started playing this cool groove , and I started singing the words to the old song Ashley and I had written .
We finished writing it at midnight and at 9 am I was in the studio cutting it .
I thought : I hope Ashley 's not mad that we redid the song .
But she loved it and came in to sing on the record . ''
Ashley Monroe recalled the writing of the song to The Boot : '' ` Me and Your Cigarettes ' was actually called ` Your Cigarettes and Me , ' and there was a whole other melody , but I had these words , '' she remembered .
`` I went to her house in Lindale , Texas , right before -LSB- 2007 's Crazy Ex-Girlfriend -RSB- album came out .
We were sitting on her back deck and she finished it with me .
She liked the idea .
She called me the day they cut it and said , `` I just wanted to tell you that Blake Shelton and I were kind of fiddling with it , and it 's kind of changed a bit .
It 's still our words , but it 's a different beat , and we 've changed it to ` Me and Your Cigarettes . ' ''
I went to the studio and heard it and -LSB- said -RSB- , ` Oh , please !
This is amazing . '
She said , ' I hope you 're not mad . '
Are you kidding me ? ''
