This was intended to be the second single from English electronic artist Just Jack -LRB- real name Jack Allsopp -RRB- 's third studio album All Night Cinema .
However after it only got minor airplay on the radio , it was replaced by `` The Day I Died . ''
The song 's protagonist is one of a number of characters on All Night Cinema who take the wrong choices or suffer bad luck .
Allsopp told The Independent August 28 , 2009 : `` I am drawn to that .
I 'm reading a collection of short stories by Richard Yates -LSB- author of Revolutionary Road -RSB- and every one is heartbreaking , but feels true . ''
Allsopp explained this song to Digital Spy : `` It 's about a character who works in a shop and is obsessed with his boss , who 's a pretty sexy woman .
She 's kind of ignoring him , and the more she does that the more his obsession turns nasty .
The song 's really about not fitting in , which is something a lot of people struggle with - they distance themselves from reality through technology .
It 's quite weird and dark ! ''
