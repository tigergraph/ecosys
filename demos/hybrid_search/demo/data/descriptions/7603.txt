This appreciation of those places where you can just be still was McGraw 's third single taken from his 12th studio album , Southern Voice .
Lee Brice told the story of the song to The Boot : `` We wrote this song down at Joe 's place in Rosemary Beach , Florida .
Joe has this little orange book of ` wisdom and hookedness . '
He 's just got all of his titles in there .
I actually grabbed his book and was going through it , because sometimes I will see one of his titles differently than how he sees it .
I saw ` Still . '
-LSB- That title -RSB- reminded me of something my mama always said .
I 'd be on the road working hard and missing home a little bit .
She would always say , ` Lee , just close your eyes .
Imagine where you want to be .
Be really still , and you can be there . '
It would make me feel better .
I said , ` Man , I love that ! '
So Kyle , Joe and I sat down to write it .
I was really excited .
I just knew it was going to be special.There 's a funny thing about that day .
My producer 's wife , Lisa , was there also just hanging out with us .
She is a song plugger in Nashville and is a very good song person .
We were in the middle of writing ` Still , ' and we played her what we had .
She went , ` Well , I do n't know ... I just do n't know if I really get it .
It 's cool .
We 'll see . '
Then Tim cuts it !
She called me as soon as he cut it , and she said , ` Alright , I was wrong ! '
-LSB- laughs -RSB- '' The song was penned by Nashville writers Lee Brice and Kyle Jacob , whose previous collaborations include Garth Brooks ' `` More Than a Memory , '' and by Joe Leathers , whose previous credits include Jason Michael Carroll 's 2008 hit single , `` Where I 'm From . ''
