Lindsey Buckingham 's son Will has a co-writing credit on this song .
Buckingham explained to Live Daily that Will , `` just happened to be in the garage one day when I was recording singing , ' ... great day , great day , ' and I said , ` What is that ? '
He said he just made it up , and I said I -LSB- could -RSB- turn that into a song . ''
