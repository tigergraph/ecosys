Bass player Matt Taylor told Alternative Press about this handclap-happy number : `` Justin wrote and recorded the verse of this song as a little ditty for music for a movie .
He played it for us while we were in the studio recording acoustic tracks for B-sides for Even If It Kills Me .
We basically told him that we were taking the song and there was nothing he could do about it .
We actually had trouble structuring this song because the verse is so catchy that we had a hard time finding a chorus that could even match it .
The final decision was to let the verse be the hooky part and have a B part that served as a sort of anti-chorus .
Also , Justin finally fulfilled his goal of working Busta Rhymes into a song . ''
-LRB- Taylor is referring to the lyric `` When I 've gone off the wall like Busta Rhymes . '' -RRB-
