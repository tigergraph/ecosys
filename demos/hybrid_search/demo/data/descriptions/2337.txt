White rapper Ryan Peters , who records under the name of Spose , hails from Wells in Maine .
This ironic , self depreciating song , which is peppered with references to Maine , was recorded by Peters on a keyboard in his basement .
He originally self-released it in January 2010 and after receiving significant airplay on local radio stations , the tune caught on in other parts of the United States .
Having aroused interest from record labels Peters signed a deal with Universal Republic Records in February 2010 .
Spose told Artist Direct the story behind the song : `` As far as where the song came from , I 've always had self-deprecating lyrics because I do n't take myself that seriously .
I 've played hundreds of live shows and I know on stage that type of stuff gets a nice response .
I knew that before ` I 'm Awesome . '
When I went to write it , I stuck to my skill of self-deprecation and tried to stay on the topic for the whole record .
I came up with that hook in like five seconds and , from there , I just filled out the verses around it .
I produced the beat to intentionally be corny as f -- k -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
`` He added : `` I 'm poking fun at stuff people find to be so f -- king important , and it really is n't in the grand scheme of things .
It 's minutia -- Twitter , Facebook , obsession with celebrity and not really taking any time to live your own life .
S -- t like that is the underlying message of the record but , on the surface , it 's just hilarious . ''
A decade after playing his first ever show with his former band Fight Shirt at the Wells Activity Center at the age of 14 , Peters returned to the municipally owned venue to shoot this song 's music video .
