This is the title track of Australian Alternative-Rock trio Sick Puppies ' fourth album .
Lead vocalist/guitarist Shimon Moore observed : `` There are only a few things every single person in the world has in common .
One is that we all need each other .
To have a song that captures that is pretty special . ''
While most of the songs on Connect were written in 2012 , this track contains the oldest riff in Shimon Moore 's musical cache .
However , it was n't until the recording of the album that he found a suitable chorus to go with it .
`` It 's fun ; I wrote it while in high school learning how to play guitar , and I always had it in my back pocket , '' Moore recalled .
`` I 've brought it up on every record , but was n't right . ''
