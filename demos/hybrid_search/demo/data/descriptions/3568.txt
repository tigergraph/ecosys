Liquid Tension Experiment is a side project of members of Dream Theater .
`` Three Minute Warning '' is a reference to the recording sessions where bassist Tony Levin wanted to improvise while Dream Theater members John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy wanted to carefully write songs .
Levin eventually told the others that if they did n't start to jam in 3 minutes , he 'd just go home .
This song is a recording of what followed .
