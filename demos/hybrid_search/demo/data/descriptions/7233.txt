This song finds Mars lamenting about getting involved with a woman who stole his money and left him broke .
He penned the song with his songwriter friend Benny Blanco and Paul Epworth , the Brit behind Adele 's `` Rolling In The Deep . ''
`` Me and Paul -LSB- Epworth -RSB- just got together and Bruno wrote an amazing song on top of it .
It kind of all came together , '' Blanco told Rolling Stone .
`` It 's like some throwback Nina Simone type s -- t , like ` Sinnerman . '
It 's Bruno .
He can sing the A.B.C. 's and you 'd be like , ` Holy f -- k ! '
He knows how to vibe . ''
