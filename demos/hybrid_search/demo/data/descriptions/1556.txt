This tender track was released as the second single from American pop singer Demi Lovato 's third album , Unbroken .
The song was penned by the songwriting partnership of Billy Steinberg and Josh Alexander .
Steinberg has written numerous US hits dating back to the mid-1980s , mostly with Tom Kelly composing the music .
They include `` Eternal Flame , '' `` Like A Virgin '' and `` True Colors . ''
The singer explained that despite the play on the word `` heartbreak '' in the title , the song is about the exact opposite .
`` Last year I began working on a song about a different kind of love , '' said Demi .
`` It 's a song about showing someone you love that you 're the one right in front of them .
This is a song about faith . ''
While shooting the video , Demi joked on Twitter about having to get intimate with her co-star , whom she had met not long before cameras started rolling .
`` It 's kind of funny .
It 's part of the job though .
You just try to get through it , but it is kind of awkward at first when you have to act like a couple with someone that you do n't know , '' she said .
`` He was really sweet , really sweet and really cute . ''
Demi opened up a bit more about the track in a video that she posted on Twitter .
`` 19-years-old ... sometimes it feels like during that brief time that I 've been alive that I 've lived through more emotions than people twice my age , '' she said .
`` I think that 's the reason I sing about love so often in the music I make . ''
The song 's music video finds Demi hitting difficulties in a relationship .
Speaking to MTV News she explained .
`` The new music video , I 'm basically trying to convince a guy that I did n't break his heart , and we get into a fight and I try to win him over again .
So I do something special for him at the end of the song . ''
The song has the somewhat dubious distinction of being the first to reach # 1 on Billboard 's Pop Songs chart whilst falling short of the Hot 100 's top 10 , since the eligibility rules for the latter tally changed in December 1998 .
