Snakes are one of the main lyrical themes of I 'm Having Fun Now , the debut album by Rilo Kiley vocalist Jenny Lewis and her boyfriend and songwriting partner Johnathan Rice .
The pair were inspired by the image of the Ouroboros , an ancient symbol depicting a serpent swallowing its own tail and forming a circle .
They explained why to Spin magazine : Johnathan Rice : We really like that image .
There 's so many definitions of what it represents .
To us , it represents unity and satisfaction because the snake is eating it 's own tail it can never be hungry and never want for anything .
But I 'm curious : does the snake ever run out itself to eat ?
Maybe not.Jenny Lewis : Well , the people that lived in this house before us were in their 90s and I 've found that I have more in common with them than I do my peers .
They left behind a lot of stuff , like a creepy old key with a skeleton key .
I wonder what that goes to ?
But on the bookshelf was a book about Ouroboros and it sparked a bunch of strange dreams , which lead to a bunch of songs.Johnathan Rice : We both found ourselves dreaming about snakes , and then we 'd be hiking in the mountains in L.A. and we would see a bunch of snakes on the trail .
Here are some more songs with snake connections : The Snake by Al Wilson.San Jacinto by Peter Gabriel.Muscles by Diana Ross.Trust In Me by Kaa the Snake .
