This song was written by Nashville songwriters Scooter Carusoe and Billy Montana about a subject they know a lot about ... songwriting !
Said Nail to Roughstock : `` People sometimes mock the waiter or the person working in the mall who call themselves a songwriter .
The next questions are always , ` But what do you really do ?
And what do you do to make money ? '
If there was ever a more well-written song about what we do for a living , I have n't heard it .
It 's got a really cool groove . ''
The song features an appearance by Lee Ann Womack .
The Country songstress is married to The Sound of a Million Dreams co-producer Frank Liddell and she was listening in whilst Nail and her husband were doing preproduction at her house .
After suggesting Nail sung the song in a lower key , she ended up singing on it with him .
