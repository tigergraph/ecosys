`` Lude '' is a slang term for quaaludes , a drug that heightens sensitivity and causes feelings of relaxation as well as euphoria , making it a popular drug for sexual activity .
While this song makes no explicit reference to the drug it does mention LSD , acid , poison and chemicals .
This song appears to be about a man stalking a woman or vice versa .
Lyrics like , `` If you want me I 'm yours '' and `` If you do n't want me/I 'm trained ... licensed and armed to the teeth '' seem to suggest that the narrator will not take no for an answer from his object of obsession , and will use violence if necessary .
