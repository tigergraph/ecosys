Speaking with MTV News ' Sway Calloway , Usher said the old-school sound of this song reflects Looking For Myself 's aim of representing the variety of musical styles that have impacted him . ''
` Twisted ' is more of a nostalgic record , so when you think about the classic R&B record , we managed a way to modernize it , even though that 's very relevant , '' he said .
`` You hear records like Cee Lo , you hear Bruno Mars and also Andre 3000 , and that sound is very relevant in this time .
So this was kind of our way to tie it all together and give you something different that you probably would n't normally get from me . ''
Musically , `` Twisted '' was inspired by the Twist dance and Fats Domino .
Lyrically , it seems someone is twisting up Usher .
The Independent On Sunday asked him if he is singing about his ex-wife , Tameka Foster .
`` Nah , it 's not , '' Usher replied firmly .
`` And it 's funny because I knew that people would potentially assume that .
And me and Pharrell talked about it -- and he explained it to me as we were writing .
` Nah , ' he said , ` that 's not what it 's about , Ush . '
What it 's about is a person who is going through something that he ca n't understand and ca n't control this woman 's emotion .
And it 's a song that actually celebrates women .
`` He added : `` Then the other side is this guy saying , ` You got ta be twisted if you think I 'm gon na accept this . '
Then there 's the triple-entendre of just a woman twisting her lipstick . ''
The Neptunes produced the song , which also features a vocal from Pharrell Williams of the production duo .
