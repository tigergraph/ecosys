This song is about fast food , specifically the spread of McDonald 's .
-LRB- thanks , Sam - Brisbane , Australia -RRB- The lyrics detail the story of Ray Kroc and buying out the McDonald brothers ' hamburger restaurant .
Kroc was a salesman for a milkshake mixing machine with 5 spindles called the Multimixer , and found out they were using 8 of these machines at a time .
Surprised at what he saw , he pitched the idea of franchising their restaurant , and selling 8 of the Multimixers to each restaurant .
When they wondered who will open the restaurants , Kroc said , `` Well , what about me ? ''
