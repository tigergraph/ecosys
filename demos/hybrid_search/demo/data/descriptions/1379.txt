Frontman Mark Eitzel in Uncut magazine March 2008 : `` All the songs I like are about things that barely exist .
My most important songs when I was a kid , were like Cat Stevens ' ` Into White , ' or ` So Long , Frank Lloyd Wright ' by Simon and Garfunkel , or ` Which Will ' by Nick Drake .
All about catching the ineffable from the air , and that 's what that song 's about - where fate and will intersect . ''
American Music Club were formed in Sam Francisco in 1982 by Mark Eitzel -LRB- guitar/vocals -RRB- , Danny Pearson -LRB- bass -RRB- , Vudi -LRB- guitar -RRB- , Brad Johnson -LRB- keyboards -RRB- and Matt Norelli -LRB- drums -RRB- .
Eitzel was soon the group 's focal point and though the band went through many personnel changes , Vudi and Pearson were still there when they disbanded in 1995 .
Though the band achieved little commercial success they received much critical acclaim and Everclear is widely considered to be the alternative rock group 's masterpiece .
Among the bands who cite them as an inspiration are Radiohead , Coldplay and Snow Control .
American Music Club reunited again in 2003 .
