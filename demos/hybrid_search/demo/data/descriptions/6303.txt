This was written by Lionel Richie for a couple who decided to end their marriage in order to save their friendship .
Commodore 's member Lionel Richie got the idea for this song from the failing marriage of his childhood friend William `` Smitty '' Smith .
After Smith 's marriage broke up the two buddies had a long conversation from 9pm to sunrise in which they agreed that it 's better to divorce as friends rather than stay married and hate each other .
Explaining why he wrote so many ballads for the Commodores , Richie explained that there was competition in the group to write songs , and every member would present songs for each album .
Since his bandmates usually wrote up-tempo songs , he would counter with ballads , as they would inevitably need a slow song or two to balance out the album .
