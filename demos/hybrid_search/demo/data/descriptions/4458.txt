This is a track from Opposites , the sixth studio album by the Scottish alternative rock band Biffy Clyro .
The disc is split into two sections : The Sand At The Core Of Our Bones and The Land At The End Of Our Toes .
Both are named after lines from this song .
Vocalist Simon Neil explained to Q magazine that each half is the exact opposite vibe to the other lyrically `` The first one signifies things that built you , that impact on your decisions in life , '' he explained .
`` The second is about your desires and how you react to certain things . ''
The song features Simon Neil 's first ever guitar solo .
This song was inspired by the many strains on relations with friends and families , induced by long years of touring .
`` It 's about sticking at it and trying not to let what we do slip away for stupid reasons , '' explained Neil to The Sun .
Sometimes you 've got to work hard at friendships and at making music .
With success it gets harder to balance relationships at home and with friends .
Other people start to have opinions and get involved but we are very close-knit . ''
Once the band decided on a double album , Simon Neil had the artwork for Guns N ' Roses ' Use Your Illusion I and II tattooed on his right arm .
He explained to Q magazine he did it to `` f -- ing get inspired . ''
