This raging three-minute anthem is the first song from Long Island rockers Taking Back Sunday 's fifth studio album to be posted online .
It is their first recording to be heard since estranged guitarist John Nolan and bassist Shaun Cooper returned to the fold after an absence of seven years .
Lazzara warned fans not to read too deeply into the meaning of the song title .
`` I was checking my email one day and ` Best Places to Be a Mom ' rolled across the news ticker .
I thought it was funny and in context it is , to me at least . ''
Frontman Adam Lazzara told Spin magazine that the band had such good chemistry in the studio , they cut the song in twenty minutes : `` We had quite a bit to drink , so we went to see if we could play the old songs , which just went terribly , '' he said .
`` So instead we tried a new song -LSB- the band had been exchanging ideas via email -RSB- and this was the first song we played all the way through -- normally , our stuff just does n't come together that quickly . ''
