This is the second single from American heavy metal band Godsmack 's fifth studio album , The Oracle .
The song is a rare balladic number and its origins lie in a tune that drummer Shannon Larkin and guitarist Tony Rombola wrote several years previously .
Larkin told Pop Culture Madness : `` Love-Hate-Sex-Pain is special to me because I feel it has a different sound for the band , and it was a song that Tony and I put together many years ago , and honestly never imagined it being picked for a Godsmack record .
When Sully put the lyrics and melody to it , it was like seeing a child grow up . ''
