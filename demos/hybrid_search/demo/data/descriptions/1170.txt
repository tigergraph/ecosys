During a June 2012 video interview , Ariana described her debut album as being '' '50s , '60s Doo-Wop-inspired . ''
Later in the year , she met up with her label and expressed dissatisfaction with the direction the album was taking .
Ariana expressed a desire instead to make the type of '90s urban Pop music she grew up listening to .
Most of the previously finished songs for the record were scrapped , except for this song , `` Tattooed Heart '' and `` Honeymoon Avenue , '' which were all reworked from their original Doo-Wop sound to one with a turn of the century Pop feel .
The album was originally titled after this song but it was renamed Yours Truly after Ariana decided that the LP felt like a love letter she wanted to sign .
