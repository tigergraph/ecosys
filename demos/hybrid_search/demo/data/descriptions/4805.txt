Officially , this song is not about Mariah Yeater , the woman who falsely claimed that he impregnated her backstage at a concert when he was just 16 .
However , it was clearly inspired by the incident and the tune even contains samples from various news outlets , reporting on Yeater 's allegations .
At a London press conference , the Canadian singer shared that , `` It 's about everything I 've gone through . ''
Justin revealed to Britain 's Fabolous magazine that he nearly quit the music business when the paternity scandal first erupted back in November 2011 .
`` At the beginning of it all I was in Florida , away from my friends and family and I was pretty sad , '' he said .
`` I got to the point where I thought , ' I do n't want to do this .
I just want to be normal . '
It was difficult because I 'd never gone through anything like that .
Usher was like , ` Prepare to have this for the rest of your career because it 's not going to stop . '
He 's gone through some stuff and most artists go through their fair share of bull .
That was just my first time . ''
Speaking to Billboard magazine , Justin compared the song the Michael Jackson classic on the same subject .
`` That 's my ` Billie Jean , ' '' he said .
`` It was something I wanted to get off my chest , and I could just say it in a song and get my point across without having to worry about the words I 'm using in an interview . ''
