Speaking to Billboard magazine in a track-by-track interview , Mraz explained the song 's meaning : '' ` Everything Is Sound ' is a song simply about the joy of singing and how in my experience in life , or my perspective in life , is about vibrating at a high frequency , '' he said .
`` If you look at the world through a microscope , you 'll see that everything 's vibrating and its that vibration that forms mass and I think that is at the core of everything that we do .
This to me , while it 's a big sing-a-long pop song , its actually quite a sacred song to me .
Just about the joy of singing , making joyful noise . ''
This song was inspired by the practice of kirtan , which is group chanting , often accompanied by instruments .
Kirtan is associated with Eastern philosophies and yoga , but has become somewhat popular in Western culture as well , with proponents like Krishna Das drawing hundreds to his performances .
Kirtan and yoga are a big part of Mraz ' lifestyle ; he 's talked about how his practice gives him `` wings '' and opens his mind for songwriting .
