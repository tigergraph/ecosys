Williams penned this uptempo love song with the Australian songwriting pair of Flynn Francis and Tim Metcalfe who comprise the Undercolours .
The singer described in a video uploaded to his official YouTube channel how after meeting and working with the Undercolours , he managed to complete Take The Crown , `` within eight days . ''
`` I took a busman 's holiday , if you like , and took a break from my career , '' said Williams . ''
-LSB- It -RSB- re-energised me in many , many ways .
`` My brother in law - who 's in a rap combo called The Connects - his music got 40 % better overnight and I said , ` What 's going on ? '
He said : ` We met these guys in a bar , these Australian guys , and they produce and write songs . '
I said to him : ` Well , get them up to the house , ' and within eight days , we 'd written the album . ''
