Leon Jackson told the Daily Record October 10 , 2008 , that this is a song `` for the ladies . ''
He added : `` It 's got a retro feel to it like Duffy .
It 's a slow one , but like all the slower songs on the album not too slow .
It 's not dreary .
It 's about being with someone for a long time and not being good at saying goodbyes . ''
