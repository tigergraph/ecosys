This song starts as an up-tempo , insistent piece of power pop , before exploding into a thick , distorted wall of noise .
Lyrically its a confession of sorts from a man who 's been to the edge , and frontman Jeff Tweedy adapts a line from `` The Battle Hymn Of The Republic '' - `` Mine eyes have seen the fury so flattered by fate . ''
When asked regarding the origins of this song , Tweedy explained to The Atlantic that he came up with the riffs , melody and chord progression whilst on vacation over the New Year in Mexico .
He recorded it onto his phone and dug it up again whilst writing material at his home in Michigan .
Not coming with anything for the lyrics , Tweedy opened up a book of American poetry , `` and randomly turned to the Emily Dickinson pages , no one poem in particular . ''
He took a lot of words , mainly verbs , `` and put them against words that looked appealing to me from Whittier and other 1800s poetry .
`` Tweedy concluded : `` It 's just looking at the words and writing a little poem trying to use as many of them as possible .
If I 'm lucky it all starts to settle meter-wise on the melody I have in my head , and then a certain amount of tweaking goes on to coax out a little more feeling .
It 's an exciting way to write , without trying to steer the ship in any one direction . ''
During a Mojo magazine interview with Tweedy , it was suggested the song is saying , `` Enjoy yourself : it 's later than you think . ''
Tweedy responded ; `` Do n't all songs seem to be saying ` Enjoy yourself : it 's later than you think . ' ''
