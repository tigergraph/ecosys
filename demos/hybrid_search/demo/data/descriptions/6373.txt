Speed Of Darkness is the fifth studio album by the Irish-American Celtic punk band Flogging Molly .
The set was recorded at Echo Mountain , an old church building turned recording studio in Asheville , North Carolina .
It was produced by Ryan Hewitt , who has also worked with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Avett Brothers .
The album was released on May 31 , 2011 by the band 's own record label , Borstal Beat Records .
The title track and album title was inspired by the experiences of Dino Misetic , the artist who did the CD cover , growing up in the Balkans during the Bosnian War between 1992-1995 .
Frontman Dave King explained to Alternative Press magazine : `` His dad was telling us about how fast war came to the country and how bad it got , so quickly .
He showed us a book that Dino was quoted in as a kid , called Sarajevo Marlboro -LSB- by Miljenko Jergovic -RSB- , and -LSB- Dino -RSB- said , ` In school , they taught us about the speed of light , but they never told us what the speed of darkness is . '
It happened so quickly , how things changed and the whole downturn happened -- I think an apt title for what we 're all about .
The war was a devastating time for people .
The line from the song , ` We set our course for Americ-ay ' -- literally , Dino and his family put a backpack on and made it to the United States . ''
