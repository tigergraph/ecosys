Martha loves the track though she 's a bit annoyed with its tongue-in-cheek manner about never returning my calls .
When she heard about it she said , ` Great , here I am pregnant and Mum 's sick and you 're attacking me on my phone etiquette .
But once she heard the song she realised it was a love song and an emotional plea about us getting together .
We 'd fight when we were kids and Mum would say , ` You only have each other , so get over it ' and now we know exactly what she meant . ''
