In this love song , Jennings asks his woman to grab her keys and purse in the middle of the night to come see him because he misses her .
Jennings from his website : `` I was in the studio mixing a song with Rich Keller and he played Midnight Train for me ; the lyrics just came to me .
I went right into the booth and laid the track down .
That 's a big song . ''
