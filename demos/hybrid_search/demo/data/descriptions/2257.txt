Kaiser Chief bassist Simon Rix told Drowned in Sound about this twist on Robert Palmer : `` It is a first because it 's the first time we 've done two different versions of a song in the studio .
There 's one melancholy one , which we worked on for a while .
It had a couple of bits we really liked but one day we thought we should have another go at it because the combination of the title , the sentiment and the downbeat-ness made it sound judgmental , something we always try to avoid .
The second version started with a beat and loads of percussion , including Mark -LRB- Ronson , co-producer -RRB- playing the a-go-go bell . ''
