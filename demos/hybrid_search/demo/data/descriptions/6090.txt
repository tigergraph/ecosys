This a track from Paul McCartney 's 2012 album Kisses On The Bottom .
The record is a collection of romantic ballads , mainly covers of classic songs from pre-Elvis days that his family used to sing .
Said Paul , `` This is very tender , very intimate .
This is an album you listen to at home after work , with a glass of wine or a cup of tea .
`` Macca 's former Beatle bandmate Ringo Starr 's first solo album , 1970 's Sentimental Journey , was also a similar collection of classic tunes from the 1920s , '30s and '40s .
The song features a harmonica solo by Stevie Wonder .
The Motown legend previously collaborated with McCartney on their 1982 hit single `` Ebony and Ivory . ''
This romantic number is one of two original tracks from the record , the other one being `` My Valentine . ''
McCartney wrote both new songs , in the same vintage style as the tunes he covered .
This was arranged by veteran American composer Johnny Mandel , who is best known for his theme song for the movie and TV series MASH .
