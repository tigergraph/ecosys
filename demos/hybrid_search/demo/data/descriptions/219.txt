According to Tejumola Olaniyan in Arrest the Music !
Fela and His Rebel Art and Politics , Fela once said of `` My Lady Frustration '' that it was `` the first African tune '' he had written , which is a strange claim for a Nigerian musician to make , but he was referring to the genesis of Afrobeat .
The original release of `` My Lady Frustration '' runs to 8 minutes 6 seconds , and African or not , it was actually recorded for The '69 Los Angeles Sessions , while he was living in Hollywood .
It might rightly be described as the template for the genr√© he created .
