This song tells a story about a group of men trying to woo the same girl , comparing the experience to a baseball game .
The pitch symbolizes a date with the girl , the men try to make a swing , they miss the pitch , then the next one in line steps up to the home plate .
The chorus is a repetition of what most people consider to be gibberish , but is well known to anyone who played Little League Baseball .
It consists of a quick paced `` Swing batter batter '' sixteen times every time the chorus comes up .
-LRB- thanks , Landon - Winchester , OH , for all above -RRB- The early twentieth century song `` Take Me Out To The Ballgame '' by Tin Pan Alley is referenced as the song begins , as trace utters the title before the music starts .
