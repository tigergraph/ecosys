This is the title track of an album by Solomon Burke , which was released just after the southern soul legend turned 70 .
In 2009 , Burke joined Willie Mitchell at Mitchell 's Royal Studio in Memphis to work together on a new recording .
It was the first time Burke and Mitchell , who is best known for mentoring R&B legend Al Green , had worked together in their careers .
It turned out to be Willie Mitchell 's last recording project as the producer died in January 2010 .
Burke told Billboard magazine that his original plan was just to drop in on Mitchell .
`` Willie was always going to come to Los Angeles , and I was always going to come to Memphis , '' he recalled .
`` Then I decided to surprise him while I was performing at a casino in Mississippi .
`` Burke 's planned 30-minute visit to Mitchell 's studio turned into a four-hour session that yielded several songs .
`` We just sang and wrote songs together , '' Burke said .
`` Spiritually minded songs about love , hope and holding on .
To lose Willie and know this was the last project he did ... his sound and spirit lives in this CD . ''
