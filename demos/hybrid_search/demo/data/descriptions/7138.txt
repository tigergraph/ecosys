This is the third single from Flo Rida 's album Wild Ones .
DJ Frank E , who has previously worked with the likes of Madonna , Kanye West and Chris Brown , provided the beat .
The Colorado producer previously collaborated with Flo Rida on his singles `` Right Round '' and `` Turn Around -LRB- 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 -RRB- . ''
This is not the first Flo Rida track to contain dual meanings - his 2009 hit single `` Right Round '' was one big double entendre .
He told MTV News that his crew help prevent him from crossing the line into downright dirty territory .
`` I 'm not the only one in the studio a lot of times , '' he said , `` so I have my boys in there and they 'll tell me and give me their suggestions and what they think .
If it 's too much I 'll go back . ''
The whistle Flo Rida croons of on this song is not of a sporting kind .
`` It 's definitely for referees , '' he joked to MTV News .
`` Well , put your own swing on it , but for the most part I keep it clean , but if you listen to it , you can take it another way as well , '' he went on to admit of the sexually suggestive song .
The song was Flo Rida 's third US # 1 , following 2008 's 10-week leader `` Low '' and 2009 's six-week chart-topper `` Right Round . ''
