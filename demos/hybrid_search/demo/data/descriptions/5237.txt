This Chris Lindsey , Aimee Mayo , and Troy Verges penned power ballad was released as the third single from American Country artist Kellie Pickler 's self-titled second album .
Regarding this being selected as the new single , Pickler said she loved the song and having originally done it on Small Town Girl , she re-recorded it for this album .
The singer added : `` I was gon na put it on every album until it was released as a single .
I guess they figure this might finally shut me up . ''
In the song 's music video , which was directed by Roman White , Pickler sheds authentic tears without the help of onions or any other film-industry aids .
The singer explained that she used her grief over a departed family member to get the emotion she needed for the camera .
`` The director , he told me , ' I want to get a shot of you cryin ' , ' '' Pickler recalled .
`` I 'm like , ` Okay , I 've never done this before . '
He gave me a few minutes to kind of take myself to a place that would make me cry .
So I just ... started thinking about my grandmother .
My grandma raised me , and she passed away when I was 15 , and so I still have a hard time .
I struggle every day with accepting the fact that she 's not here anymore .
Then I got to thinkin ' about how difficult it is for me that she 's not here with me at this particular moment , on this video shoot .
I just kind of took myself to that place , and it just came pourin ' out . ''
On this song about a broken relationship , the female narrator describes the feeling of losing the one she loves .
