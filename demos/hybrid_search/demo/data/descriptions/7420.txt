This driving tune was the first song that Dawes leader Taylor Goldsmith completed for Stories Do n't End .
He admitted : `` It 's a very singular song .
A lot of the songs on the record can be a little more broad , about a period in someone 's life or trying to explore a certain feeling .
This song is about a specific experience of being on an airplane and that 's not a very poetic or lyrical idea . ''
