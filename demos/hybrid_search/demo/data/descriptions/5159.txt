Demi wrote this spare , emotional ballad with Carl Falk , Rami Yacoub and Savan Kotech , the three-man songwriting team who have penned many of One Direction 's songs including their US top ten hits `` What Makes You Beautiful '' and `` Live While We 're Young . ''
Demi told MTV News that she made a lot of changes to the lyrics because of the extreme emotion she was feeling .
`` There was a turning point in the song where it was about one thing , but I was like , ' I want to try something new , ' '' she said .
`` So I just like , sang , kind of free-styled the lyrics , and I just changed the song completely .
And my producers in the studio were like , ` Whoa , this just got heavy . ' ''
