London singer Valentina 's layered vocals combine with TDCC singer Alex Trimble 's for the band 's first ever duet .
Trimble told NME : `` I was writing the words in LA , I wrote them in one night and as soon as I did I knew there had to be a girl singing them with me .
We 'd discovered Valentina through ` Gabriel ' , the track she did with Joe Goddard . ''
This is one of the darkest songs Trimble has ever written .
He commented to The Sun : `` Dark , but not sinister - more a sense of paranoia .
It 's about being alone , separate and different to everything else .
It 's a love song to no one .
It 's about not fitting in . ''
