Brice closes his sophomore album , Hard 2 Love with this song that he penned for his fianc√©e and their infant son . ''
` One More Day ' is so precious to me , '' he said .
`` I wrote it with my keyboard player , Reggie Smith , about being gone on the road all the time .
It goes directly to Sara and our son , Takoda , because I know how much Sara gives , and I know how much I take .
I totally get it .
And it 's like you 're always saying , ` Just give me one more day . '
Hopefully , in the future , I 'll be able to say it was worth it to work so hard .
Right now , she gives me the freedom to follow my dream .
And she helps me every day with it .
This is a gift to the two of them . ''
