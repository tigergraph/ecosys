This song is about taking action to avoid oppression .
Marley wrote it with Peter Tosh , and the song was influenced by their upbringing in Jamaica , where they had to fight for respect and acceptance for their Rastafarian religion .
The music is based on the song `` Slippin ' Into Darkness '' by the band War .
Marley was friends with members of the band , and encouraged them to come to Jamaica .
The Burnin ' album , where this song first appeared , was released by Marley 's group The Wailers .
In 1974 , The Wailers broke up but Marley continued to tour and record as `` Bob Marley & The Wailers , '' even though he was the only original Wailer in the group .
