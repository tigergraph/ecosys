Everything Everything close their sophomore set , Arc , with what frontman Jonathan Higgs told The Line Of Best Fit is , `` a chink of light at the end of a pretty dark album . ''
He added : `` It 's a recurring theme in the album .
Speak up .
What 's up with you ?
Talk about it .
Tell people if you 're struggling .
Do n't try to hide it .
What are you wrestling with ? ''
The song 's music video takes inspiration from classic paintings and was directed by Higgs .
He said : '' ` Do n't Try ' is about letting it out and this video is all about absolute abandon .
You can keep it in inside but it always comes out in the end one way or another , or it destroys you .
`` I was inspired by the way repressing a mind can often make a person wildly creative , '' Higgs added , `` and I thought lot of dark imagery in paintings of hell were especially direct .
I wanted to try and bring classic paintings to life in as much colour and expression as possible . ''
