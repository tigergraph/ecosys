Viewers rang in upset at the singer 's raunchy routine , which was viewed by several million children and their families .
Aguilera defended her presentation at the UK premiere of Burlesque , saying : `` I do n't think there is such a thing as too raunchy when it comes to the art form of burlesque .
It 's very empowering to women to feel confident in their own skin and in their bodies and this represents that .
Everyone in the spotlight is judged and there are many opinions out there , but I stick true to what I believe in . ''
