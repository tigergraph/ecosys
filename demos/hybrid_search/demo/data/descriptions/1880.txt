Pete Townshend originally wrote this about a girl he met in Australia , but he changed the song to fit the context of the Who Rock Opera Tommy .
`` Sensation '' describes the way Tommy feels after the mirror has been smashed and he can see , hear and speak again .
-LRB- thanks , Fintan - Manchester , England -RRB- In the film version of Tommy -LRB- not the album -RRB- , this song is used when the lead character is flying on a parachute .
Tommy makes peace between 2 feuding biker gangs and all followers flock to him .
-LRB- thanks , Colin - New Egypt , NJ -RRB-
