Ward collaborated on this retro , reverb-heavy Pop tune with longtime PJ Harvey producer John Parish .
He told the story of the song to UK newspaper The Sun : `` I do n't write on piano very often but I wrote the melody first and then the rest just fell out of my brain - like groceries falling through a paper bag .
It took one hour and then I recorded it with John Parish in Bristol -LRB- England -RRB- and he added all the necessary noise that is his expertise . ''
