This single from contemporary Christian musician Bebo Norman 's seventh studio album , Ocean is a prayer inspired by a personal story about his brother 's struggle with prescription drug addiction .
He explained on his website : '' ` God of My Everything ' is a prayer that I wrote watching my older brother 's 15-year struggle with addiction and recovery .
It is a difficult thing to speak openly in our Christian communities about what it means for a fellow believer to struggle with something as culturally frowned upon as addiction ... but it has been perhaps the most inspiring story that I have ever witnessed .
I have seen firsthand what it means for someone to truly offer God everything ... every lie , every deceptive word , every foolish thought , every weakness , every single thing finally laid down before the mercy of God .
I watched God step into the humiliation and the shame and the brokenness of addiction -LRB- and all the peripheral damage that goes along with it -RRB- and impart a brand of goodness and healing that is simply incomprehensible .
We hear it said over and over again that God wants us `` just as we are , '' but I do n't think we really believe it .
This song is a prayer for God to truly be the God of everything ... every single part of us ... the good and the grotesque .
To acknowledge that God is the God of our most shameful failures , our fears , our faults , our brokenness , and even our addictions -- and yet his love for us DOES NOT CHANGE -- is to acknowledge that God is truly the God of our salvation , our peace , our hope and our absolute healing . ''
