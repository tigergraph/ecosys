Susan Boyle dedicated herself for many years to care for her aging mother who eventually passed away in 2007 at the age of 91 .
The loss hit her hard and she explained how this song bought back memories of her how she felt at the time .
Said Susan : `` That 's about the end of summer , when everything is dying and leading into winter .
It 's about losing someone you love .
This song reminds me very much of the death of my mother five years ago and being left alone and how I felt at the time .
It 's a very sad and emotional song .
It 's about missing someone , but you do n't realise that at the time because you are too busy focusing on other things until they are gone and you are left with a big hole in your world . ''
This is not the famous old jazz standard , but was originally penned by Scottish singer-songwriter Paolo Nutini for his debut album , These Streets .
