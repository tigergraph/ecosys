This was the last top-10 charting hit of Billy Preston 's prolific career .
He was active in music from the 1950s into the 2000s , and was then stopped only when he lost his battle with kidney disease .
This song -LRB- and the entire album -RRB- was done in duet with Syreeta Wright , a soul and R&B singer best known for working with and being married to Stevie Wonder .
Wright was married three times and each marriage was short .
While Preston and Wright never married , you can hear chemistry in every lyric of this song .
`` With You I 'm Born Again '' was written specifically for the film Fast Break , a very routine sports-comedy film at the tail end of the '70s from producer Stephen J. Friedman , who made a name for himself in comedy flicks , especially sports-related ones .
Today , the song is the most notable thing people remember about the film , which tells you something .
Songwriting credits here go to singer Carol Connors and songwriter/composer David Shire ; Shire also had a hand in the scores to the films Saturday Night Fever and Return to Oz .
As for Connors , she was in the group The Teddy Bears , which also included Phil Spector -LRB- busy man , was n't he ? -RRB-
, and co-wrote the theme to the 1976 film Rocky and several songs from Disney 's the Rescuers film series .
A bit of trivia about the singers : Syreeta Wright was born and raised a Baptist , but apparently dropped it by the time she moved to Ethiopia to teach transendental meditation , and then finally she converted to Islam .
Billy Preston is also known for his work with the Beatles .
His honors on that account extend to being called one of the `` fifth Beatles , '' and being the title character in the unfortunate , delightfully horrible 1978 film Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band .
So this hit followed that film 's release , showing that not even Hollywood 's biggest turkey in the film musical category ca n't keep a good man down .
