Eight years before Quentin Tarantino released the movie Jackie Brown , John Mellencamp used the title for a song that tells a very different story .
Mellencamp 's Jackie Brown is a destitute man who will never escape poverty .
The song is not so much a social commentary as a reflection of how Mellencamp was feeling at the time .
His finances and career were on the upswing , but he was devastated by the recent divorce from his second wife , Victoria Granucci , who took their two young daughters with her when she left their home in Indiana .
Mellencamp explained to Rolling Stone : `` I wrote ` Jackie Brown ' about myself in a different scenario : me disguised as a poor guy - not as a guy that had been successful and pretty much lost everything , which in my mind I had , because I 'd lost my daughters .
The song is about how you have to go outside to use the bathroom because you 've sunk so low . ''
