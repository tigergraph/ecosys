Marshall Mathers is Eminem 's real name .
In this song , he makes it clear that he 's just a regular guy .
Eminem goes on the attack in this song , mocking boy bands , Vanilla Ice , and his critics .
He also retaliates against Insane Clowne Posse , who diss him on their parody version of `` My Name Is '' called `` Slim Anus . ''
