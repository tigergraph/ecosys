When Kate wrote this song she was trying to emulate the Pink Floyd sound .
David Gilmour of Pink Floyd was a helped nurture her career .
The line , `` He 's too busy hitting the Vaseline '' refers to the fact that there are a lot of homosexuals in show business .
She did not mean this as a criticism , but just as an observation .
-LRB- thanks , Lee - Ottawa , Canada , for all above -RRB- This is a song about show business , not just Rock music but show business in general including acting and theatre .
Bush is sort of portraying a female movie star -LRB- probably a sex symbol -RRB- and the song is a bit of a parody of a lot of the things in show business .
