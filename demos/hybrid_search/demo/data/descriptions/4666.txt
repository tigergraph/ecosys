This was lyrically inspired by one-time wrestler Sheriff Buford Pusser , who became the Sheriff of McNairy County in Tennessee between 1964 and 1970 .
He turned into a folk hero for his one man battle against clandestine gambling dens and illegal distilleries on his patch , though some criticized his tough tactics .
A number of films and songs have been based on Pusser 's life .
For instance , The Drive-By Truckers made him the subject of a trilogy of songs `` The Boys from Alabama , '' `` Cottonseed '' and `` The Buford Stick '' on their 2004 album The Dirty South .
Also , the 1973 movie Walking Tall was a semi-biographical account of Pusser 's colourful career .
It was re-made in 2004 , in an updated version in which the lawman was re-named Chris Vaughn .
This was originally included on the band 's self-released 2006 debut album of the same name .
