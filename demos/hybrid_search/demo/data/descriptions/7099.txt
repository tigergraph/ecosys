This Resilience track is about the difficult time the band had on the road after releasing their Drowning Pool album , resulting in them parting ways with vocalist Ryan McCombs .
Bassist Stevie Benton explained to The Gauntlet : `` That song is kind of about the last year or two that the band had on the road touring on the last record .
Everyone was miserable and ready to move on .
Our side and I 'm sure Ryan 's side as well .
Instead of just wallowing in it , it was best to go our separate ways . ''
