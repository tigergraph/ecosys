This is the title track of the Welsh Post-Hardcore band Funeral for a Friend 's sixth album .
Vocalist Matt Davies explained the meaning of the album title : `` Five people on a stage , a conduit for the message and the music , delivering that to people who want to listen in , be a part of whatever it is that we 're doing and being involved , '' he said .
`` It 's purely about delivering the message .
After 10 years of being a band , we see how much what we 've done has affected people who care about our stuff .
Whether it 's lyrics or whatever , these songs transcend us and become something more to a lot more people .
It sounds lofty I know but that 's how it feels to us when we meet the folks who dig our band and who treat these songs with so much love and respect .
It blows our minds constantly . ''
Bassist Richard Boucher told Alternative Press magazine that this `` is probably one of the heaviest tracks we 've ever written . ''
He added : `` It 's a speeding roller coaster of aggression .
It has a heavy hardcore influence .
This is one for the live set , for sure . ''
