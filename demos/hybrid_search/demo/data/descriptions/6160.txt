This rockin ' anthem was written by Smith together with frequent collaborators Wayne Kirkpatrick and Amy Grant .
Smith recalled to CCM Magazine presents 100 Greatest Songs In Christian Music : `` I 'll never forget getting together with Wayne out at Amy 's farm .
First of all , just the music was written , and I felt for 1988 , it was a bit of a twist - especially the choruses , which were really different for me .
I remember just where I was when I said , ` This song 's going on the record no matter what ! '
And then we still had the lyrics to write , so Wayne came up with the ` Secret Ambition ' idea .
I do think the song became very popular because of the video . ''
The music video tells the story of the Resurrection .
Smith told CCM Magazine presents 100 Greatest Songs In Christian Music that , `` this company that was going to shoot the video for the song offered to do it for free . ''
He added : `` They wanted it to follow the story of Jesus , and they wanted to shoot it on videotape .
I just thought , ` How tacky is that going to be ? '
I refused to do it for a year , until I finally succumbed to the pressure and said , OK , but we 'll pay the extra - whatever it is - to shoot it on film , and we did it . ''
