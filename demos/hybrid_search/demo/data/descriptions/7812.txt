Will Young told the Independent newspaper May 9 , 2008 about the lyrics for this song : '' ` Home ' is the first song I wrote with -LRB- Asian/English producer -RRB- Nitin Sawhney .
Quite often when you write your first song with someone you get your best as there 's a bit of nervous chemistry going on .
I was definitely heartbroken when I wrote that .
It means a lot to me because it 's a sad song but there 's positivity in it .
I think that 's what songs should be - I do n't think there should be slit-your-wrists songs .
Joni Mitchell said songs have a utility to them and I think about that when writing .
That 's describing a situation , which is desperately sad , a sad resignation .
You try your best and something has to come to an end . ''
