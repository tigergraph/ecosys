The second single from Tears On Tape was the first track recorded for the album .
HIM were attempting to find a balance between their heavy guitars and full on melancholy of the music and frontman Ville Valo told Noisecreep it was this song that opened the floodgates : `` I love the Ronettes , the ` do-run-run-run ' pop stuff .
I love the lyrics , having ` blue , blue blue ' being repetitive .
It 's a '60s doo-wop thing .
It 's cool to incorporate all ideas , and to not restrict yourself .
We decided to steal a bit from Ronnie Spector and Sabbath and create a bastard child , '' he said .
`` That song was important .
We cracked open the beer bottle and knew we had a new album ; we found our way .
We sweated it out in a little rehearsal space , and here were are . ''
The song 's music video was helmed by Eugene Riecansky , a multi-award-winning director and animation and motion graphics who has previously worked on clips for Madonna and The Prodigy , as well as television commercials for MTV Europe and Mastodon .
Valo explained the song 's meaning to Noisecreep : `` Lyrically , it 's a Memento Mori type thing , and is very straightforward .
Let us celebrate what we have now , as opposed to dwelling on the mysteries or what will happen afterword . ''
