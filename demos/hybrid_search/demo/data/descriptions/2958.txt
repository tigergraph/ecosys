This features a snippet from a song that was apparently recorded in France in 1860 .
Drummer Joe Bradley told Rolling Stone : `` I think it 's the first song ever recorded .
Cole -LRB- Alexander -RRB- found it on the Internet , and he liked the ` woo-woo ' sound . ''
Bradley told Stereogum that there 's no particular significance to the album title .
He explained : `` Like 200 million thousand is how much our parents love us , or 200 million thousand is how many records we 're going to sell 200 million thousand trees in the state of Oregon . ''
