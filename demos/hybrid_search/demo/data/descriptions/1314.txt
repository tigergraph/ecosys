In this song Plies brags about his cars and the jewelry .
MTV News asked the Florida rapper if he felt feel any guilt about releasing a song with such subject matter during a worldwide recession ?
Plies replied : `` You need to feel like -LSB- you have plenty of money -RSB- , bruh .
Regardless of how bad it is , you need to feel better , man .
The people that ai n't got no money now , it was the same people who did n't have money four years ago .
Now it 's justifiable not to have money .
In terms of the street perspective , it is n't as much money circulating in the streets as it once was .
But in terms of our -LSB- national -RSB- economy , the recession was a scapegoat for corporate America , who can file bankruptcy now and re-create a whole ` nother company , debt-free .
The people who are struggling now been struggling .
Anytime you can create music and give hope , anytime you can make a person feel good ... that record makes you feel good whether you hear it at 10 in the morning or 3 in the morning in the club .
It makes you feel good . ''
