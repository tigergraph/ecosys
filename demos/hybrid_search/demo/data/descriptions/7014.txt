Frontwoman Emily Haines told Drowned in Sound : `` Some tracks on Fantasies went through multiple incarnations before sounding complete . ''
She added that this song , `` started out as an upbeat electro-rock track with a lot of sections and some very involved arrangements .
No matter what we did it just never sounded natural , it sounded like three different songs stuck together that did n't want to stick .
It was one of the last songs on the record to be completed because it was such a puzzle and we all felt so strongly about it .
In the end the right version came from stripping everything away .
Someday I will make the other two sections into songs in their own right . ''
