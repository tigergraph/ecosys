This song was originally written for the theme tune of the children 's cartoon The Raccoons , which was played in many countries between 1980 and 1992 .
The song was written by Kevin Gillis , Jon Stroll and Steve Lunt , and the first version was n't sung by Lisa Lougheed .
She became involved with the show at a later date and even became the voice actor of the popular character `` Lisa Raccoon . ''
At this time she did sing `` Run With Us '' and it is this version that became a minor hit in Canada and is the most famous version .
-LRB- thanks , Brother Ralph - UK -RRB- For a short while this was mistaken for a `` Drug Song . ''
People assumed that the song was meant to be sung by a drug dealer that has `` Everything you need '' to remove the depression that is referenced in this song .
