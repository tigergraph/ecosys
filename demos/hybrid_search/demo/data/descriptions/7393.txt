This was one of several tracks that Moore wrote for Outlaws Like Me with his producer Jeremy Stover and country songwriter Rhett Akins .
Their other songs that made it onto the album are `` Beer Time , '' `` Bait a Hook '' and `` If You Do n't Like My Twang . ''
The cut is more geared towards Moore 's male fans , than those of the fairer sex .
Said the singer to WSOC radio in Charlotte : `` Sunshine Babies ' is my mom 's least favorite song on this album and I do n't know why .
It 's fun !
I was trying to write something that day that I thought she would crank up on the lake .
Women , bikinis and beer came to mind and we came up with the title ` Sunshine Babies . '
It ROCKS . ''
