The subject matter of this song is a relationship .
Frontman Dexter Holland told Spinner the lyrics can be interpreted in two different ways .
He explained : `` Relationship songs can be really dark and depressing .
Or if they 're romantic , they do n't feel right for our band because we do n't want to be cheesy .
If I 'm writing about a relationship , there will be two sides to it .
Things are n't black and white in real life .
There 's always some gray area .
You can be the best and worst guy in the world at the same time .
You can take the song a couple of different ways .
It could be that the lovers are hanging on through the storm because all they have left is each other .
That 's the romantic way .
Or , it could be one person is hanging on even though they should be apart .
You can interpret it opposite ways even though it 's the same lyrics . ''
