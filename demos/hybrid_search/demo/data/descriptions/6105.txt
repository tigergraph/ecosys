Rick Ross ' `` Maybach Music '' featuring Jay-Z was a track from Ross 's second album , Trilla .
He then recruited Lil Wayne and Kanye West to join him on its sequel `` Maybach Music 2 . ''
To complete the trilogy , Ross enlisted three more heavyweights , T.I. , Jadakiss and Erykah Badu for this track .
The neo-soul queen and the Miami MC previously worked together on a remix of Badu 's `` Window Seat . ''
Erykah Badu also directed the song 's music video .
Ross said of T.I. 's contribution : `` I felt the time was right for me and T.I. -LSB- to work together -RSB- , '' he explained .
`` We had never personally collaborated with each other on a record one on one .
Early on in my career , I had said -LSB- negative -RSB- things when I did n't know him .
Just us being bosses and us being leaders and us being examples , we bossed up .
We both did .
He came from home doing what he did .
I did my thing .
`` But gradually the animosity waned , and Ross asked Tip to collaborate .
`` Just on a mutual respect for each other , I reached out to him .
When I got that verse back , I was like , ` He meant that . '
We had been seeing each other over a period of time , saluting each other , bumping into each other , he knew I was a fan of his .
We captured that moment in time which was one of the dopest records .
And that meant the most to me .
I used to play that T.I. verse in my studio , like , ` This set the tone , right here .
It set the tone . '
It just felt good for the homie to lace me .
I salute Tip . ''
-LRB- Source : MTV News -RRB- Ross paid tribute to T. I. 's contribution in an interview with MTV 's Sucker Free : `` I had to do it real big with someone I never collaborated with before : Tip , '' Ross said .
`` We got a full orchestra , a live orchestra from the strings on down .
It 's gon na be a masterpiece .
It felt good to work with him .
He just came home and got in the lab .
He heard the music , he knows the legacy of part one and part two .
And I feel like the verse he spits on this record may be one of his hardest verses .
It 's that ` Rubber Band Man ' flow . ''
Ross explained that his collaboration with Erykah Badu led to her appearing on this song : `` Her music always attracted me ; it was always attractive to my kind of music , '' he said .
`` Once we collaborated with the ` Window Seat ' remix ... the lanes of communication was open , I was like , ` Let 's do something different . ' ''
