Joni wrote this song because her manager told her to write a hit .
She thought it would make sense to write about a radio or radio station because they would play it on the radio a lot .
-LRB- thanks , Dylann - Los Angeles , CA -RRB- Graham Nash , David Crosby and Neil Young all took part in the sessions for the song , but only a Graham Nash harmonica part was used on the final release .
Released in October 1972 , it became Joni 's first hit single , reaching the Top 20 in January 1973 .
Her previous hit songs were hits for other artists .
The lyrics are a metaphor in which the narrator is a car radio and a radio station hoping to please listeners .
-LRB- thanks , Charles - Charlotte , NC , for all above -RRB-
