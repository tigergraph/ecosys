This lilting , string-filled ballad about how love can hurt all almost feels like a Country song .
It is one of the fruits of the trio 's willingness to explore uncharted sonic territory on Paramore .
`` People obviously give Hayley credit for being an amazing singer , but I do n't think they really understand how versatile she is and how much her voice can do , '' said guitarist Taylor York .
`` You really hear different sides of her on this album . ''
