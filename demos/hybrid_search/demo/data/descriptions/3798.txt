Soundgarden bassist Ben Shepherd wrote the music for this song prior to the disbanding of Soundgarden in April 1997 .
He recalled in a commentary video : '' I remember moving to Kingston -- we lived downtown and -LSB- you -RSB- look out on the beach and the water and stuff , 'cause It 's a bay , it goes like that .
And there was this huge , like , fake Hollywood lettering -- ` TAREE ' -- and it was all totally overgrown . ''
Several of King Animal 's tracks are in unusual time signatures , including this one , which is in 14/4 time .
Vocalist Chris Cornell added the lyrics after the band reconvened in 2010 . ''
It was my love song to the natural side of the north west where I grew up , '' he explained .
`` I never lost that feeling .
To me , that 's what Taree 's about . ''
