When Panic !
At The Disco were approached by the people behind the Batman Arkham City video game to contribute a song to the soundtrack , singer Brendon Urie was thrilled .
Having been a big fan of the previous Batman game , Arkham Asylum , Urie told Kerrang !
, he was `` all excited '' and `` like a little kid . ''
The song was something the Panic !
pair already had up their sleeve but was adapted for the Batman soundtrack .
Said Urie to Kerrang !
: `` The bridge of the track has a talking part and it never rally worked out -LRB- for our own album -RRB- .
The people creating this album then added their dialogue to the song and we fell in love -LRB- with it -RRB- again .
It now features Hugo Strange talking to Bruce Wayne and threatening him and giving him an ultimatum .
We listened to it and I thought that was pretty badass ! ''
Urie explained to Kerrang !
what the track is about : `` It 's just kind of a story of the travels of one person and his willingness to be destructive , and in a sense it could very well fit with the story of a vigilante like Batman . ''
