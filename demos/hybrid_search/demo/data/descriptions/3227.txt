This ballad opens with introspective lyrics where Kimberley Perry sings of yearning to break free before it turns into a heartbreaking anthem .
The song was written by Sarah Buxton , Rodney Clawson and Chris Tompkins .
The track was released as the third single from the Band Perry 's Pioneer album .
Kimberley Perry said the sibling trio decided to soften things up after two releases , `` Better Dig Two '' and `` DONE , '' that were full of attitude .
`` We could n't be all spit , '' she said .
`` We had to show a little bit of the vulnerability side of what we do .
We definitely have that sense of being the underdog of snapping our fingers but also , we really wore our hearts on our sleeve more than ever before .
` Do n't Let Me Be Lonely ' has one of my favorite melodies on the whole project .
It sounds big but the lyrics are so small in the sense that they 're so personal , so vulnerable . ''
