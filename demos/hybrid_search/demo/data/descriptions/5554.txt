This was used on the soundtrack to the movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back , but it was n't written specifically for the film .
In our interview with Marcy Playground lead singer/songwriter John Wozniak , he explained : `` That was just a fun one .
I just wanted to write a song about that sort of slinky , weird , zoot suit-wearing A&R guy-ish/movie business slimeball .
And I guess Kevin Smith really liked the song , so he put it in the movie .
It ended up on the soundtrack and everything . ''
This later appeared on Marcy Playground 's 2004 album MP3 .
