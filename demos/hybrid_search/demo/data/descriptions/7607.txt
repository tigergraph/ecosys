Co-singer/guitarist Ed Droste commented to Drowned in Sound : `` Can you hear the girl 's giggle ?
It changed the song for me from ` scary ' to ` everything else . '
`` Co-singer/guitarist Daniel Rossen added : `` Along with ` Fine For Now ' this song was transformed and shaped in the end by playing it as loud as humanly possible while we were upstate .
I think of it as a really demented love song .
skirts the boundary of being totally insane and unbearable , which is somehow a selling point for me .
When the song was finished and the choir was on with their laughter and snickering I was kind of scared that we had accidentally channeled Satan . ''
