This song is about Kristinia 's real-life plea for parental approval of her first love affair .
She explained in publicity materials : `` A parent telling their child not to fall in love is them saying ` I 'm not going to put up with your heartache .
Parents need to let their kids grow .
Love is a beautiful thing . ''
