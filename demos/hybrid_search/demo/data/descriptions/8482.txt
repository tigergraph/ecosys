This is the second single from American rapper Roscoe Dash 's debut album , The Juice and the follow-up to his breakthrough hit , `` All the Way Turnt Up . ''
He explained to MTV News the difference between the two songs : '' ` Turnt Up ' was kind of like my get-your-foot-in-the-door record and video , and I kinda , like , put that motivational message into ` Turnt Up , ' `` he said .
`` But ` Show Out ' is kinda like that have-fun , wild-out , it 's - the-summertime , do-what-you-want-to-do type of record . ''
The song 's music video , which features Dash with various expensive cars and bikes and riding a jet ski , was as enjoyable to shoot as it looks .
`` It did n't even seem like we were shooting a video , '' Dash said .
`` It really was like we was just out there having fun and the cameras just happened to be there . ''
Dash revealed to MTV News that R&B star Chris Brown initially tried to get on the song .
`` I was like , ` Man , do n't even worry about the ` Show Out ' record , ' because we not gon na push a remix until it 's peaked anyway .
It 's gon na take time for all of that , '' Roscoe said .
`` I 'd rather get something that 's gon na be quick that we can go ahead and throw out there early . ''
