This pensive romp ponders themes of escapism and displacement .
Frontman and lyricist Justin Pierre admitted in publicity materials that whilst he has battled all his life demons of indecision and insecurity , he now has hope that a resolution is soon within his grasp .
He explained : `` I think I 'm much more of myself than I 've ever been .
What does that mean ?
I 'm not sure .
I do n't think I 'm any one thing .
All you can do is be responsible for your words and your actions .
I do n't think I 'm there yet , but I have my moments .
I think I 've come to terms with the fact that I 'm comfortable with being uncomfortable . ''
Pierre filmed a one-take video for this song with the help of indie director Shane Nelson .
The front man cited to Spin Magazine a trio of influences for the clip : `` I wanted it to have the coolness and stupidness of Weezer , the absurdity of the Flaming Lips , and the nonchalance of Pavement , like , ` We really do n't give a s -- t .
It combines all these things that I like , all these little nuggets of ridiculousness . ''
Drummer Tony Thaxton recalled to Alternative Press : `` We wrote this song in the fall of 2008 during our first writing session in Minneapolis , Minnesota .
I think this was the first thing that we wrote -LSB- for the album -RSB- that got us really excited and seemed like it had a lot of potential .
I remember when we first started it ; it was a bit slower and almost had a ` You Do n't Know Me ' -LSB- by Ben Folds -RSB- kind of thing going on .
We kept playing with it until it finally became the way it appears on the record . ''
