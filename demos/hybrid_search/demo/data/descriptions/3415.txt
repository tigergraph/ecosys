Like several of the songs on the album , this makes reference to the Columbine shootings , for which the mass media attempted to blame Manson 's influence despite all evidence to the contrary .
Like a lot of his lyrics , this deals with Manson 's perception that the media tend to martyr and deify those who die within the public eye .
