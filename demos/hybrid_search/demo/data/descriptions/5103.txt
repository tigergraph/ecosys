This is the opening track of Chickenfoot III , the second album by the Rock group Chickenfoot .
The band comprises ex Van Halen vocalist Sammy Hagar , his former bandmate bassist Michael Anthony , drummer Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on drums and guitarist Joe Satriani .
The song was arranged on the spot .
Said Satriani to Music Radar : `` When we record , a lot of times we 'll play a song a few times , and everybody will throw ideas around - Mike or Chad will want to shorten a part or change something .
This was a pretty fast coming together from the whole band .
We played it live and put in a few overdubs - that was it .
Very fresh , with everybody tearing in and going for it . ''
Satriani told Music Radar about his contribution to this song : `` Something I tell people at guitar clinics is , ` All techniques are equal . '
If you do n't know modes , you think they 're exotic and mysterious .
But once you know them , you realize that they 're no different from any five-note scale .
It 's all music .
On ` Last Temptation , ' I did n't shy away from just slamming down barre chords , because that 's what was needed .
At the same time , I combined those chords with super-heavy licks that the whole band would play .
I was thinking of ensemble playing with really pounding chords .
Lots of exploding and contracting . ''
