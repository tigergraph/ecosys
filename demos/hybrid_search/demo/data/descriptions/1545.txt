This song is Soulfly frontman Max Cavalera 's personal tribute to his love of American Heavy Metal .
The Brazilian band leader told Noisecreep : `` Seriously , man , I would not be here without Ted Nugent , KISS , Van Halen , Metallica .
I saw the original Van Halen in Brazil back in the early 1980s .
For me , they brought it all back where it needed to be -- they made music very special .
I LOVE Van Halen , man .
I would get haircuts like the guys in Metallica back then !
America has produced such amazing stuff .
I live in Arizona , now .
I just love the American desert .
The drama of it , the intensity -- it totally influences my music now .
My whole family loves it . ''
