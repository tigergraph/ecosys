The second single from Gossamer finds Passion Pit frontman Michael Angelakos singing of drinking , pill necking and other bad things before proclaiming , `` Go if you want to , I 'll be alright . ''
Speaking with Pitchfork , Angelakos explained the dark content of this track .
`` I really fu -- ing hate dishonesty , '' he said , `` which a lot of indie music is especially prone to .
I like artists that are really honest and talk about their lives , because people invest in that as much as they invest in the record itself .
I had a really rough year , and I got engaged right before recording - and recording takes a real toll on you .
I vilified myself .
I had to do it .
I have a lot of issues , and a lot of people in the world have a lot of issues .
There 's the saying that the Sherman Brothers wrote : `` A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down . ''
That 's exactly what Passion Pit is to me .
`` The song was released on June 12 , 2012 .
The chorus consists of bits of five different songs that Angelakos had written .
He told Q magazine that it took him eight hours of programming before he even had a rough demo .
Angelakos sings , `` I 'm so self-loathing that it 's time for me to see .
Reality from what I dream and no one believes me , '' reflecting his long-term struggles with bipolar disorder , which involved multiple hospital stays .
He told UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph : `` I 've been suffering from ... you know , bipolar since I was 17 .
But I do n't think that has anything to do with the music .
Lots of people try to over-glorify it , like this thing that 's really interesting , and actually it 's the most painful thing in the world so I 'd rather not talk about it . ''
