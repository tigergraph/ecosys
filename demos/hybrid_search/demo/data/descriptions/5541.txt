Centering around the spell-checked chorus `` I 'm ur driver , ur my screw , '' this double entendre slice of Power Pop is unlike anything else in Prince 's recent catalog .
The song was the first that Prince made available to feature his new all-female backing band , which comprises Donna Grantis on guitar , Ida Nielsen on bass , Hannah Ford Welton on drums .
It was made available online via Prince 's official site in the form of a lyric video on January 22 , 2013 .
During an interview with Minneapolis ' The Current , it was revealed that Prince recruited Ida Nielsen via MySpace .
Want to watch the entire eight-minute video ?
The only way it seems is to pay $ 1.77 and then download the entire movie file from Prince 's home page .
Why $ 1.77 ?
The Bible is littered with 7s and states that it is the Divine number .
Prince has displayed an affinity for numerology in the past and the mysterious numbers he slots into his material are thought to be coded biblical references .
He has form for using sevens - shows priced at $ 77 , naming an album 3121 , -LRB- which adds up to 7 -RRB- , and launching his own fragrance at his Purple Will Reign charity concert on 7.7.07 .
