Essentially this song is about a guy in a long-term relationship with a girl he truly loves and cares about , but he constantly finds himself seduced by a girl appropriately named `` Pandora . ''
This becomes clear through the lyrics , `` I know that I 'll regret what I did . ''
The singer also sums up his feelings for Pandora by using the words `` The lust , the sex , the heat , this sweat . ''
He continues to describe his girlfriend using the words `` The love , the hate , the guilt , my fate . ''
