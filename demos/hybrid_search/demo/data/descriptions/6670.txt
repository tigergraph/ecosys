Fleetwood Mac 's Lindsey Buckingham makes a cameo on this song ; he contributed to four songs on Hesitation Marks .
Trent Reznor told NME : `` I always thought Lindsey 's style of playing was very interesting .
He tends be underrated , sitting in the midst of so many big talents .
I decided to see if by chance I could get him on my album .
Phone calls were made , and to my amazement , he agreed . ''
`` By coincidence , '' Reznor added , `` we went to the studios where they made Tusk .
Lindsey shows up , and I believe it was the first time he 'd actually been there he 'd actually been there since they made it .
He picks the guitar up , and this sound comes out .
I was watching him , trying to check out what pedals he was using to make it , but mostly he was n't !
It was just the way he was playing , pure technique . ''
The song contains a lyrical interpolation from the Hank Williams song `` Weary Blues From Waitin ' . ''
