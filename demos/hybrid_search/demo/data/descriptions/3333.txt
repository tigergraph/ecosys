Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale recalled the recording of this song to Artist Direct : `` Normally when you record a ballad , you set up a click , then you play a guitar and you sing it .
You replace the guitar , and you replace the voice .
-LSB- Producer -RSB- Steve Albini was like , ` The string players are coming here at 1pm so whenever you 're ready ... ' I had to sit with four amazing London Philharmonic Orchestra string players and sing ` Straight No Chaser ' live alongside them .
Steve really pushed me there .
He said , ` You 've got to really feel it and be right in there with them . ' ''
Rossdale told Artist Direct : `` When I showed Nigel -LSB- Pulsford , guitarist -RSB- the demo , he was listening to the lyrics and he goes , ` That is one depressing song ! '
-LSB- Laughs -RSB- I just said , ` Cool ! '
It was like Beavis -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
It felt really good to be that depressing ! ''
Razorblade Suitcase producer Steve Albini had Gavin Rossdale record his vocal track in the studio with four London Philharmonic string players .
