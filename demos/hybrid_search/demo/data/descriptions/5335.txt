This is the lead single by New Zealand singer/songwriter Pip Brown , who records under the name of Ladyhawke , from her second studio album Anxiety .
The track was written and produced by the singer alongside long-time collaborator Pascal Gabriel .
Brown wanted the video to have `` an early '90s psychedelic vibe '' but it ended up being based on '70s film Eyes of Laura Mars .
She told Digital Spy : `` I gave the director a brief on what I wanted and she basically did the complete opposite . ''
The singer went onto admit that she loved the way it turned out .
Brown explained to NME that the album 's title is built around the feeling of ` Anxiety ' and nervousness .
She said : `` It 's called ` Anxiety ' because every song has that sort of feeling , my mindset throughout the recording was a mixture of being so tired and just being worried the whole time .
I 'm a walking ball of anxiety .
It completely sums up the album . ''
