In an interview with The Boot , Lynne was asked if this song was directed at a particular family member .
She replied : `` I think it started out with me being really mad at one particular family member and then turned into , well , hell , I hate you all , f -- k off !
Somebody asked me , ` What do you think is going to happen when they hear it ? '
And I said , ' I hope they hear it .
Maybe it 'll make them do some thinking . '
It 's not just about my family , it 's about everybody 's .
Sometimes family can be the most hurtful people in the world .
I got lucky enough to write a song about it .
I hope that when people hear that song they go , ` She knows exactly how I feel .
I 'm sick of those sons of bitches , too ! ' ''
