This song is rather cryptic and abstract .
It is difficult to find a solid meaning to it , but it looks like `` Cast It Out '' is about someone experiencing a loss .
Most lines in the chorus would support this theory .
The song 's bridge supports it even further , as it may be referring to the pattern of human beings always coming closer together during a time of loss .
