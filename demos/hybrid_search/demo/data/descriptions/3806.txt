Frontman and bassist John Cooper told StereoTruth.net : `` I am really excited about this song , which is probably the most overtly Christian song on the album .
I think ` Forgiven ' is a very hopeful song , and even though it 's not the first time a song has been written on the subject , it strikes a balance between being very worship oriented and honest as well .
This is a song about letting yourself or someone else down , but finding the power to not beat yourself up over it and to find closure with the person you hurt . ''
