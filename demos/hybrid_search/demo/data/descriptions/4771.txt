This was the lead single and opening track of French rock band Phoenix 's fourth studio album , Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix .
Phoenix singer Thomas Mars told the Washington DC free newspaper Express about this song : `` We liked the idea that it 's just a mash-up , that our songs bring in influences from everywhere .
I think that Franz Liszt was one of them ; there were other things , visuals .
And maybe it was the fact that we grew up in Versailles and we were surrounded by historical things .
Maybe they came back that way . ''
Regarding the word `` Jugulate , '' that shows up in the lyrics , Thomas Mars told Rolling Stone : `` I love the word - it means to cut someone 's throat , with an amazing amount of blood coming out .
There are a lot of words we use on the album that come from French , like ` armistice . '
They have a romantic feeling . ''
Franz Liszt -LRB- 1811-1886 -RRB- was a composer and pianist , who in the mid 19th century was the most famous music performer in Europe .
The flamboyant Hungarian pianist would begin a concert by tossing his long blonde hair and throw his green gloves to the floor .
He then would proceed with hair flopping over his eyes , thumping his piano to pieces .
Women worshipped him , fought over him and collapsed in orgasmic swoons while he played .
The German romantic literary figure Heinrich Heine coined the term `` Lisztomania '' to describe the massive public response to Lizst 's piano performances .
This featured in trailers for the film Where the Wild Things Are .
It also was used in a number of TV shows including Cougar Town , Entourage and Royal Pains .
