Vocalist Cee-Lo experienced much tragedy in his childhood .
He was only two when his minister father died .
When he was 16 his mom , also a minister , was badly injured in a car crash .
She was paralyzed below the neck , and died two years later .
The final words on this track , `` I wan na thank you , friendly ghost , I wan na thank you Mom and Dad for hurting me so bad , ' are a reference to his parents dying early and leaving him to get on with his life .
He was driven by bereavement to make something of himself .
The singer told the Observer Music Monthly March 2008 : '' ` It 's created a wonderful career , a purpose in life . ''
