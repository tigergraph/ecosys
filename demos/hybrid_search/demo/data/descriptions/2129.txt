This is the third single from Manchester electro-pop band Delphic who comprise vocalist James Cook -LRB- vocals -RRB- , guitarist Matt Cocksedge , multi-instrumentalist Richard Boardman and drummer Dan Theman .
The CMU Daily asked Cocksedge what process Delphic go through in creating a track .
He replied : `` We start out with an idea , whether it 's a lyric a melody or a chord sequence .
We take the idea and put it on our laptops and play around with it and see what comes out .
We choose a path to go down , build it up on the laptops and then take it to the practice room where we add drums and guitar and build up the song properly til we have the final product . ''
This song is typical of Delphic 's sound , which mixes indie guitars and euphoric electronic beats .
Cocksedge told The Hounslow Chronicle : `` We 're about electro music with soul .
What we try to do is get an organic feeling .
We want to resolve that clash between euphoria and melancholy .
Music is unique in that sense -- you can get both feelings at the same time . ''
