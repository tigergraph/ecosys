Frontman Matt Bowman told The Sun May 29 , 2008 about this track : `` While we were in the studio , producer Stephen Street was crying out for us to do an acoustic track .
We did n't have anything until one morning Oli -LRB- guitarist Oliver Main -RRB- said : ` Listen to this . '
Everyone loved it so we started recording it straight away and finished it that day . ''
