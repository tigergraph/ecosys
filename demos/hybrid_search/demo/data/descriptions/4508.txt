This is the first single and title track from Rock singer Melissa Etheridge 's 11th studio album .
The song 's first line is `` I was 17 , you kissed my lips . ''
Etheridge explained to Spinner the inspiration for that lyric : `` It was the first time I kissed a girl .
I try to put my own experiences in my songs , of course , and yet have them remain universal .
It was intense going through that experience and having the fireworks go off : ` Oh my God , this is greatest thing ever !
This is what all my girlfriends have been talking about when they kiss boys ' and stuff .
I was like , ` Hmmm I do n't feel that ' and then all of a sudden I felt it and I had to keep it in to myself .
It will eat you up .
It 's horrible to have to put a lid on something . ''
AOL 's Spinner asked Etheridge about the impetus for this song .
She replied : `` When I first sat down in January , I really started working on the songs .
I knew I would be recording in July and I wanted to give myself months to really bring this together because the whole concept of the album is just that everything in our lives comes down to fear and love .
There are only two vibrations in the world and you 're either making a love choice or a fear choice , so the working title of this album was ` Songs of Fear of Love . '
`` Etheridge added : `` As I started writing these songs , my older kids said ` Mom , what are you going to call the album ? '
I said ` Songs of Fear and Love ' and -LSB- my daughter , Bailey -RSB- said , ` It 's too many words , mom . '
I said , ` Okay , How about ` Fearless ' ? '
and she said ` Taylor Swift album .
Why do n't you say ` Fearless Love ' ? '
So ` Fearless Love , ' that 's kind of perfect , but I have to write a song for that now .
I think she said that in the morning , I dropped her off at school and I came home and I wrote this song . ''
Etheridge explained to Spinner the lyric , `` You are what you are afraid of . ''
Said the award-winning singer-songwriter : `` That 's what I 'm trying to push forward in this song .
I am what I am and we all are .
We are exactly what we are : what we look like , we feel , that 's what we are .
We take that and become whatever we are afraid of .
If you take that on and say , ` Oh I 'm afraid of this ' and it stops you from doing , then you become what you are afraid of . ''
