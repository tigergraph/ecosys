PWT 's vocalist and songwriter Tom Higgenson discussed this song 's meaning with Alternative Press magazine : `` This is the darkest and possibly coolest track on the album .
It 's ` cool ' in the sense that I could hear it in a Quentin Tarantino movie .
It has a badass quality to it that Plain White T 's usually ca n't ever pull off .
The funny thing is that it 's a love song - a very sick and demented love song that asks , ` How evil and wrong can I be before you stop loving me ?
Will you be by my side no matter what I do , and no matter who I am ? '
It 's a true test of love under the most grim circumstances . ''
