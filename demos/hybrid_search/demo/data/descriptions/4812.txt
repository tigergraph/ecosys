Pure Love is an English-American Alternative Rock band formed in July 2011 by former Gallows frontman Frank Carter and ex-Hope Conspiracy and Suicide File guitarist Jim Carroll .
Their debut album Anthems was released on February 4 , 2013 .
This was their second single , which was released on May 30 , 2012 .
Carter explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` It 's about good clean fun , a bit ` lads on tour ' and being part of the gang .
Every song on the record is a celebration of something , whether it 's kicking back against something , or celebrating a new lease of life - which for both of us , is what this band is . ''
