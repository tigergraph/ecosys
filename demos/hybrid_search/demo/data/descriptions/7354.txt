Now a duo , after the departure of founding member Aaron Pfenning in 2010 , Chairlift 's Caroline Polachek and Patrick Wimberly recorded their sophomore album Something in New York and London .
They recruited producers Alan Moulder -LRB- Depeche Mode , My Bloody Valentine , Nine Inch Nails -RRB- and Dan Carey -LRB- MIA , Franz Ferdinand , Lily Allen -RRB- to work the knobs and Carey also mixed the majority of the record .
This was the first single to be released from the set , which was released on Grizzy Bear bassist Chris Taylor 's label Terrible Records in August 2011 .
The song 's music video finds Polachek further exploring the idea of free association .
We see her dancing around a room at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in a lime colored bodysuit , sequencing her choreography to the song through improvisation .
We could n't find the word `` Amanaemonesia '' in our dictionary .
No wonder , as Polachek told Spinner : `` It is a made-up word , made from combining a bunch of other different words .
It means everything it sounds like . ''
Polachek explained the song 's meaning to About.com : '' ` Amanaemonesia ' is about irresponsibility and guilt , combined with confusion and anarchy and being very small in a sea of a big population .
Splintering ourselves into multiple personalities within the song , that 's a good perspective to approach the song from . ''
