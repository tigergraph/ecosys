Lead singer-guitarist Patterson Hood wrote this Country Gothic ballad about his first cousin once removed , who died at the age of four , before Patterson was born .
The death of Bonnie , while central to the song , is not the focus of the story ; rather , Patterson portrays the family 's emotions and the fact that Bonnie 's everlasting presence remains with the family decades after she is gone .
In interviews , Patterson reveals that he grew up hearing the story of Bonnie 's life and death , and that it had a profound effect on him .
Singer-guitarist Mike Cooley adds that one good thing about Bible Belt mentality is that it allows you to express yourself without judging the people you 're describing .
-LRB- thanks , Ekristheh - Halath , for all above -RRB- Bonnie is described as a `` swollen angel '' , suggesting she might have had a kidney disease .
Bonnie 's father , Patterson 's great-uncle , was an extremely religious man , who believed that Bonnie 's illness and death were intended by God as a punishment , not of her , but of himself .
