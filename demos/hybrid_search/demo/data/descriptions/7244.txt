The Cholla is a genus of cylindrically stemmed cacti that is native to the southwest and south-central United States , Mexico and the West Indies .
This song was penned after a visit to the Cholla Gardens in Joshua Tree National Park .
The band explained to The Line Of Best Fit : `` It talks about a broken relationship between a child and their mother ; the negative side of unconditional love .
The cholla as a symbol of something that gives life and that drives people away . ''
