This is the big dance number from Hannah Montana : The Movie .
The song originated when the president of music and soundtracks for Walt Disney Studios , Mitchell Leib , approached songwriters to pen a song that could be `` Miley 's ` Macarena ' meets ` Achy Breaky Heart . ' ''
Songwriting duo Nikki Hassman -LRB- formerly of the Contemporary Christian group Avalon -RRB- and her husband Adam Anders in conjunction with choreographer Jamal Sims and movie director Peter Chelsom rose to the challenge to create the song and its accompanying dance sequence .
Leib commented to Billboard magazine : `` There 's humor in it , and it 's very , very true to the spirit of the movie , and that 's why I think it 's striking a nerve . ''
Miley told Billboard this is the scene that she loves the most in the Hannah Montana movie .
