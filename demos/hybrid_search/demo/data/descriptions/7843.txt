Britney Spears did not have any writing credits on Femme Fatale , for which the singer was criticized in the media .
What they forgot was that the songstress co-penned songs on most of her previous albums -LRB- at least according to the official credits -RRB- , including two of her singles , `` Everytime '' and `` Me Against The Music . ''
Britney has also been busy penning tunes for other artists and this collaboration with Gregory Kurstin and Nicole Morier made it onto the final track listing of Selena Gomez & The Scene 's When The Sun Goes Down album .
When she was initially given this song , Selena was unaware that Britney had helped to write the tune .
`` I just heard the song ; I fell in love with it , '' the Wizards of Waverly Place star told MTV News .
`` They gave it to me , the producers who worked on it , and I came and sang and saw that she had co-written it , so I was very excited . ''
This tune about a blossoming romance was reportedly written for Spears ' Circus album , but failed to make the cut .
Selena told Billboard magazine that the song 's lyrics nearly became all too relevant to her .
She said : `` I love the lyrics saying you 're completely in love with someone and you 're going to crash into them and get whiplash .
The funny thing about that is that I actually did get into an accident two days before I recorded that song .
I did n't get whiplash , it was n't a bad accident but it was really funny . ''
