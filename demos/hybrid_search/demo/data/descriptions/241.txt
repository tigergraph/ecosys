This song finds Ward casting himself as a mutinous TV editor .
It is one of several songs on A Wasteland Companion that was inspired by dreams .
Ward told Spinner , `` that came out of a dream of this newscaster whose name was Billy Boroughs .
I was just sitting on the couch watching this newscaster and he was saying some frightening things , and it turned into a song . ''
