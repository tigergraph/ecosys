This is the first single from Away From The World , the eighth studio album from Dave Matthews Band .
The group performed the song for the time on TV during the April 24 , 2012 episode of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon .
`` Mercy '' was released on July 16 , 2012 .
Away From The World is a record about all the different aspects of love .
`` At first , love was tied with the way the cave person next to you smelled , '' Matthews told Billboard magazine .
`` I could be in the most spiritual moment of my life and then I smell my wife going past me , and I will redirect my spirituality .
It changes the shape of my jaw .
But when we were putting the album in order it was very funny to go from -LSB- `` Belly Belly Nice '' -RSB- to ` Mercy , ' which is about love of the world and merciful love . ''
Producer Steve Lillywhite lent his skills to Away From The World after contributing to the success of DMB 's first three albums .
Lillywhite had n't worked with the band since a series of unrealeased recordings in 2000 , which led to the leaked Lillywhite Sessions .
Dave Matthews Band made Billboard history when Away From The World landed at # 1 on the Billboard 200 .
It meant that they became the first band to have six consecutive albums debut at the peak position on the album chart .
