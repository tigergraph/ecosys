This is the fourth single from London based drum and bass production duo Chase & Status ' second album , No More Idols .
The song features the vocals of Nottingham-born soul musician Liam Bailey , who was discovered and signed by Amy Winehouse on her record label Lioness Records .
Bailey toured with Chase & Status on their late 2010 UK tour , where he joined them during the performances of this song .
Will `` Status '' Kennard told Contactmusic.com about the duo 's hook up with Bailey : `` Liam was an absolute pleasure to work with .
He is one of the most charismatic people we 've met .
It was a real honour and we were very lucky that we heard about him from the Head of Universal who had just signed him .
We watched an interview with him and we thought he was cool .
At the time , we were struggling with the track and we had tried hundreds of artists ; none of which was giving us a certain angle or edge .
Liam sent us a demo , which had a dubby vibe to it , and we loved it .
He 's just a creative guy and a genius .
He has a bright future ahead . ''
