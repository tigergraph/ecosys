Band member Vanessa said of this reflective ballad to The Daily Mail January 2 , 2009 : `` We love doing upbeat songs , but we wanted to do a slower number that reflected the album as a whole . ''
When this ballad was first released to radio programmers , the lyric , `` I ca n't decide if I should slap you '' was misheard as `` I ca n't decide if I should stab you . ''
A new radio edit was made , with the phrase amended to `` leave you '' as their record company feared the original lyric would decrease radio play and sales for promoting violence .
Frankie of The Saturdays commented to The Daily Mail : `` We knew that we were singing ` slap , ' so we did n't pay much attention to it at first .
But we changed the lyrics to have a clean conscience . ''
