This song finds Matt Berninger stretching his vocal range after becoming immersed in the work of Roy Orbison .
`` I mostly admired his ability to take those melodic left turns , '' he told The Sun . ''
` In Dreams ' has eight melodies and never goes back to a repeated verse or chorus .
` Heavenface ' does that on our record while ` Pink Rabbits ' also keeps changing and shifting.Although my vocal range is nothing like Orbison 's I was trying a lot of higher registers . ''
