American singer-guitarist Joe Bonamassa is in the tradition of such classic blues influenced acts as Led Zeppelin .
However , lyrically the songs on Dust Bowl are a far cry from the macho posturing of Whole Lotta Love .
He told UK newspaper The Sun : `` The early Zeppelin albums are timeless - that 's why we 're still listening to them 40 years after they were made .
But I want to update that style to 2011 .
I 'm not Bob Dylan but I want my songs to mean something .
So ` Black Lung Heartache ' is about coal miners in West Virginia who have to make the decision whether to do a job that will kill them slowly with this disease so they can feed their families , or default on their mortgage . ''
