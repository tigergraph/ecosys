This is a track from the Arctic Monkeys fifth studio album , AM .
The song was debuted on September 2 , 2013 , during Zane Lowe 's BBC Radio 1 show .
Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme delvers soulful backing vocals on both this tune and another AM track , `` Knee Socks . ''
Homme sung using a tequila bottle he 'd just emptied as an echo chamber .
The black-and-white video represents the Arctic Monkeys individual take on Americana as we see them perform the song in a field , amidst a gaggle of models .
It starts with guitarist Jamie Cook slowly riding a tractor as he makes his way to the band 's gig clad in a 3-piece suit .
The clip was directed by Focus Creeps , who also made the visuals for `` R U Mine ? ''
and `` Why 'd You Only Call Me When You 're High ? ''
Frontman Alex Turner described AM 's sound to NME as , `` like a Dr. Dre beat , but we 've given it an Ike Turner bowl-cut and sent it galloping across the desert on a Stratocaster . ''
Turner also cited the music of Outkast , and Aaliyah as helping to shape the LP .
This song 's R&B feel reflects the aforementioned musicians influences on the record .
The phrase `` One For The Road '' refers to a final drink before leaving home to fortify one for the journey ahead .
The expression and practice has fallen victim to the increasing enforcement of drink-driving over the past few decades .
The song 's guitar solo was originally on `` Fireside . ''
Turner told NME : `` It was on there in a different key , but it did n't really seem to fit . ''
