This mellow number is a lead single from American rapper Diddy -LRB- previously known as Puff Daddy then P Diddy -RRB- 's fifth studio album , Last Train To Paris .
The song introduces Puff 's new trio Dirty Money , consisting of himself , Danity Kane 's Dawn Richard , and singer-songwriter Kalenna Harper .
Last Train To Paris is a concept album in which Diddy 's character takes an emotional journey from London to Paris and falls in love with a mysterious lady .
This song finds Diddy crooning -LRB- with the help of auto-tune -RRB- rather than rapping .
He admitted to MTV News : `` I 'm definitely not the greatest singer in the world .
It took me two weeks to do the song , straight up .
It took me two weeks to get the song right .
It 's really supposed to be an expression .
It 's supposed to be the way your soul sounds .
Not the way R. Kelly or Chris Brown sound , Mario , Trey Songz .
It 's supposed to be a very vulnerable emotional experience .
I think we were able to capture that in the video and do it outta the box . ''
The song samples Jay-Z 's `` Where I 'm From '' from his 1997 Where I 'm From album and also features the Notorious B.I.G.
