Sheryl Crow wrote this song about Nicks based on stories Stevie told her after they became friends .
Crow produced this track as well , along with four other songs on the album .
Sheryl Crow and Stevie Nicks go back a ways , and the two performers frequently collaborate .
In return for Crow 's work on this song , Nicks performed on Crow 's 2002 album C'Mon C'Mon .
The Trouble In Shangri-La album actually represents an accumulation of a decade-and-a-half 's worth of work as well as three songs from the 1970s .
Is it just our imagination , or does every other song by Stevie Nicks look back to her Fleetwood Mac days ?
In the course of compiling this album , Nicks got sidetracked ... to say the least .
One instance was writing a song for the 1996 action film Twister , which led to her crossing paths with Lindsey Buckingham and eventually the reunion of the band in 1997 .
While we 're on the subject of Stevie Nicks , pay no attention to the wild-hair rumor that Lindsay Lohan was planning to buy the rights to her life story and film it with herself -LRB- Lohan -RRB- in the lead role .
While Lohan might have burbled this idea at some point , Nicks has said that this would happen - quote - `` over my dead body '' - end quote , along with something about somebody needing to `` stop doing drugs and get a grip . ''
Rowr !
