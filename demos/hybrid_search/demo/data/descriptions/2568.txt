Thrice is a Californian Rock band who was founded in 1998 by guitarist/vocalist Dustin Kensrue and guitarist Teppei Teranishi while they were in high school .
Kensrue told Christianity Today the story behind this track from their seventh album , Major/Minor : `` It 's a dark song .
Our drummer was showing us some slow shutter speed pictures he had taken .
Everything 's out of focus , and the images create this blurry light trail .
He said that the pictures captured some of the feelings we 'd had in the past year or so -- a lot of loss in our band , specifically with cancer .
Our guitar player 's mom passed away about two years ago , and the bass player and drummer 's dad passed away earlier this year .
And my dad has brain cancer .
It 's just been kind of a crazy time .
So we built that song , using those pictures as inspiration .
It 's dark all the way through.I used to try to fit too much into one song , to try to ` resolve ' it by the end .
But I started realizing that as long as I have a catalogue that 's balanced , I can go into a dark spot and leave someone there in that zone , and not try to rescue them from the implications of what I 'm getting at in the song .
So ` Blur ' is leading into a despairing place , but there 's a lot of hope presented in other songs to balance that out . ''
