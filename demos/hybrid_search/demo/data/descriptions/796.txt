In the December , 2006 issue of Blender magazine , Courtney Love explained : `` The song 's about living in a trailer in Malibu with my first boyfriend , Jeff .
I was 16 .
And It 's kind of about Kurt , too .
It 's an empathy song : Come to me , I 'll save you .
I wanted the boy in the song to drive away from Hollywood and the drugs .
When I was pregnant , Kurt and I always had this thing about getting out of the basement apartment we lived in with dealers next door and going to live in Malibu .
It 's a very healing place . ''
Love wrote this for Stevie Nicks to sing .
She wanted to write her a hit .
