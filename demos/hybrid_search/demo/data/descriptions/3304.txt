This antiauthority anthem came out of a bit of improvisation .
Madball 's guitarist Mitts told us : `` We were in the room together and we were kind of stumped - we were just looking for inspiration .
My singer -LRB- Freddy Cricien -RRB- looked over at our drummer -LRB- Ben Dussault -RRB- , and was like , ` Yo , kick a beat .
Play a beat right now .
Just play any beat that comes to your head . '
He started playing a rhythm , and then we started punching out a riff over it .
But it started from the drums out , and that was definitely a unique approach .
We never did that before .
The song came out cool . ''
