The title may have been inspired by the 1962 novel by Katherine Anne Porter , Ship Of Fools .
It was made into a movie in 1965 .
The phrase has since become common in rock lyrics .
The lyrics present a bleak image of the world heading toward oblivion .
Morrison wrote most of the songs on this album .
On their previous album , The Soft Parade , he contributed very little because he was drunk most of the time .
This is about an acid trip .
Along with 1967s `` The Crystal Ship , '' the second time The Doors used the ship as a metaphor for drugs .
Images of the Earth from space may have given Morrison the idea to equate it with a ship .
The moon landing was in the news throughout 1969 .
Photographer Henry Diltz , who photographed the album sleeve for Morrison Hotel , wrote in California Dreaming : Memories And Visions Of LA 1966-1975 the story behind the LP cover : `` The Doors really liked the Crosby , Stills and Nash cover on the couch and so they called us to come and have a meeting at their little office in Hollywood to talk about their new album cover .
Ray -LRB- Manzarek -RRB- mentioned he had driven to downtown LA with his wife and had seen the Morrison Hotel - he was just offering that up as an initial idea and everyone thought it sounded great .
So Ray , Jim , Gary and I went round there that afternoon to have a look at it and thought it was perfect .
We came back a couple of days later with the whole group and took some pictures . ''
