This was written and produced by Wyclef Jean .
Djbooth.net asked Jennings why he teamed up with collaborators such as Wyclef Jean on this album .
He replied : `` I 'm definitely not a producer , that 's not my passion .
I think that people always do better with things that are their passion .
I had a chance to sit out with Wyclef and do some stuff with him , and music is those guys ' passion , and I saw how good they were at it , and I really wanted to be able to just focus in on my passion which is the writing and the singing , and let another guy - who , that 's his lifelong dream , to be a producer - go ahead and do what he does .
