This is the first single from the Courtney Love-fronted Alternative Rock band Hole 's fourth album , Nobody 's Daughter and their first new single for ten years .
It is the first release of the new line-up of Hole , which apart from Love also includes British guitarist Micko Larkin -LRB- formerly of London indie rockers Larrikin Love -RRB- , bassist Shawn Dailey -LRB- of Rock Kills Kid -RRB- , and drummer Stu Fisher .
Jack Irons , formerly of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam , also played drums on Nobody 's Daughter .
Love penned the song with Hole guitarist Micko Larkin .
She told MTV News why she feels the subject matter strikes a chord .
`` It just felt zeitgeist .
It just felt right , '' Love said .
`` There are so many skinny little bitches doing so many bad things .
It was like , remember when Paris Hilton used to say ` That 's hot ? '
... It was just the right phrase for the right time . ''
The song was first played live during Hole 's reunion show at the Shockwaves NME Awards show at London 's O2 Shepherds Bush Empire on 17 February , 2010 .
It had its radio premiere on New York station , WRXP on March 3 , 2010 .
Love told MTV News the titular `` Bitch '' does n't actually exist .
`` We have n't found her yet , '' she said , with a laugh .
`` A lot of reviews have focused on whether the ` Skinny Little Bitch ' is me , except I 've only become skinny -LSB- in my 40s -RSB- .
I only figured out how - when I 'm stressed , instead of overeating , under-eating - in my 40s .
And I 've never been little .
I 'm 5 ' 11 '' ; there 's a lot of me .
So I 'm not really skinny , nor am I little .
I might be a bitch though . ''
