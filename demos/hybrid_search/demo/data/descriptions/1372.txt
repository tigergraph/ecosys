This ethereal , slowly building track has guitarist Romy Madley Croft singing notes in the background over bassist Oliver Sim 's lead vocal before the pair reverse their roles later on in the song .
DJ-producer Jamie Smith told Spin magazine that it was the tune that inspired the writing process for Coexist .
`` Oliver wrote it at the end of the last tour on the bus , '' he said .
`` That 's the only thing that 's ever been written on tour for the xx .
Then it was one of the last ones to be finished .
It went through a lot of change . ''
This song is not a cover of Everything But The Girl 's `` Missing , '' though the British duo 's hit tune has been cited by the xx as an influence on Coexist .
