This candid account of childhood abuse at the hands of two male family friends is a reworking of a track with the same title by Eminem .
Angel Haze grew up on 7 Mile Road , Detroit just along from where Marshall Mathers spent his teenage years .
Haze was apprehensive when the song was released fearing people would use it against her .
The rapper hoped it would n't get noticed , but the track quickly made waves both inside and outside the music world .
`` I guess it was good that it got noticed because I got so many people messaging me , more boys than girls actually , who have had the same experience , '' she told The Daily Telegraph .
`` It really helped me and I think it helped them too . ''
The writing of the song was an impulsive decision , rather than something Haze had considered doing for a long time .
She recalled to The Daily Telegraph : `` I was on my way to the BET -LSB- Black Entertainment Television -RSB- awards and I ended up writing it on the plane .
I cried so hard , then I was like , ` OK , well , if I 'm going to do it , I 'm going do it . ' ''
