This Anthony Smith , Marla Cannon and Ben Carver written song finds Lauren singing about the boy of her dreams .
She told Taste of Country : `` I really like this one because it describes this great guy .
I am singing about a boy that in my eyes would be perfect .
He has all of these flaws that make me love him .
It says he 's got ta love his mama , shake my daddy 's hand and like going to church on Sunday morning .
I can relate .
I would say that 's some pretty crucial stuff in a guy .
It was the last song that I got for the whole album and I fell in love with it .
I said , ` We have to do this one . ' ''
Speaking to Taste of Country about performing love songs despite her inexperience regarding matters of the heart , Lauren said she believes she 's still able to sing about such subject matter .
`` Well , I 've had crushes and stuff , so I do n't really mind singing about it , '' the 17-year-old singer explained .
`` I like any song that can tell a story that people can relate to . ''
