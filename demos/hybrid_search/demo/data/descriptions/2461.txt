Tifton , Georgia native Kip Moore made his first public performance at a Mellow Mushroom restaurant in the Georgian town of Valdosta .
He moved to Nashville , Tennessee in 2004 , where songwriter and producer Brett James helped him sign to a publishing deal .
Four years later he signed to a record deal with MCA Nashville and released his debut single `` Mary Was the Marrying Kind '' in early 2011 , which peaked at # 45 on the country chart .
This Mississippi Delta blues infused track is his second single , and his first Hot 100 hit .
Moore has also had success writing for other artists , co-penning two tracks , `` All the Way '' and `` Let 's Fight , '' from Thompson Square 's 2011 self-titled debut album plus `` Settin ' The World On Fire '' from Jake Owen 's Barefoot Blue Jean Night LP , which was released the same year .
Moore explained to Taste of Country that the song specifically goes back to his wilder years , when he was dating an older woman who was not impressed by his Isuzu Stylus .
It broke down one night , and his father lent him the keys to his truck .
`` And I picked her up man , and it was like I picked up a whole ` nother woman , '' Moore revealed .
`` She was , she was a woman that time . ''
Moore wrote the tune after reflecting back on his youth and how he came to the realization that owning a truck helped him pick up girls .
`` The song is what it is , '' Moore told Taste of Country .
`` It 's one of those things where I drove a little box car in high school and college .
In both high school and college , similar things happened to me where I was maybe pursuing somebody .
I got somebody to go out with me , and they did n't seem real interested every time they climbed in that little bucket car of mine .
`` However , Moore quickly learned that ditching his `` little box car '' for a pickup can change everything .
`` On two different occasions that thing broke down and somebody let me use their truck , '' he continued .
`` It was like I became a whole new person .
I could n't peel -LSB- girls -RSB- off of me .
I was like , ` Wait a minute ... I 'm the same damn dude , I 'm just driving a different ride .
There must be something about a truck ! ' ''
Moore penned this song with frequent collaborator Dan Couch late in the day during a songwriting session .
He recalled to Mike Ragogna of The Huffington Post : `` We had already gotten done writing a song and he was about to walk out the door .
We had just got done talking about when my dad let me hold that truck , how I had this little beat up car and I was hanging out with girls who did n't seem too into me , then I picked her up in that truck and picked up a whole other woman .
I threw the keys to my dad when I came home and said , ` Damn dad , there 's something about a truck . '
Right when I said that , he was walking out the door and said , `` We 've got to write that right now . ''
It was about five o ' clock and -LRB- Dan -RRB- had to be home , and he called his wife and told her we had to write something else .
We sat there for another few hours and that 's what came out . ''
The song finally arrived at # 1 on the Country charts in its 33rd week on the survey .
`` Small town America is everywhere , '' Moore commented to The Boot regarding the song 's appeal .
`` It 's in every part of the country and there are so many teens and college kids that are living that song , and even people that are a lot older than that .
There are people going out in fields , fishing , drinking beer and sitting on tailgates .
That 's just he way so many of us grew up and that 's why the song has resonated .
It 's very relatable for anybody coming from these small towns . ''
