McEntire told Great American Country : `` This is the song that Rivers Rutherford -LRB- Brooks & Dunn 's `` Ai n't Nothing ` Bout You '' -RRB- wrote with Mark Nesler -LRB- Tim McGraw 's `` Just To See You Smile '' -RRB- .
I loved the beat and the melody .
It reminded me of a Rascal Flatts song in the first part of it .
It 's really catchy .
It 's a song that I 'd be singing the middle of the night when I woke up , so I knew it would be a great song when it is in your subconscious like that .
I would say this is the least powerful woman song , because she is like , ` Oh , I ca n't give in and take you back one more time , I ca n't , ' but then she does .
I hate to say it 's a booty call song , but it does remind me of that .
I guess this is my booty call song ! ''
