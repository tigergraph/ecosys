This is the opening track and first single from Australian alternative pop group Crowded House 's sixth studio album , Intriguer .
The album title was inspired by a shadowy figure seen behind curtains at a Sydney hotel by front man Neil Finn and Australian artist/cartoonist Michael Leunig in 2001 .
Neil Finn discussed his song writing in an interview with Spinner UK : `` I have a tendency to chip away at songs .
I love that process of keeping something up in the air as long as possible .
I think you end up with a better song at the end .
There 's a chance you overcook them , but I 've got used to the idea that a great song is part inspiration , part loving force of will , determination and struggle.It 's a craft , but I 've always thought of craft as a self-satisfied word .
To me , it 's far more primitive than that .
The moments of greatness are nothing to do with craft , it 's do with instinct .
A good line might pop into your head when you 've been looking for a second verse , and you 've have a flash of inspiration .
You would n't get there without the struggle , so it 's about leaving yourself open to ideas.I can talk about this forever , but writing songs will always be a mystery .
If I knew how I wrote a classic song , I would do it every day , and I ca n't .
Luckily for me , not many other people know how to do it either . ''
The rousing opener is one of several songs on the record that were first debuted at a gig at The Leigh Sawmil , north of Auckland in February 2008 .
The tune was worked over on the road and was awash with guitars until mix day when according to the band 's website , Neil Finn `` went to town with a korg microsynth , a gift from a friend that arrived that day . ''
