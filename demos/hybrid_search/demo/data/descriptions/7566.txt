Knight co-wrote this song with Jamie Hartman of Ben 's Brother .
It is from the British soul and R&B singer 's sixth studio album , 100 % .
Knight explained on her website : `` This as the title suggests is a stripped down semi-live production of a 6/8 classic time signature soul ballad . ''
She added : `` The key is deliberately low , as it produces a warmer , richer sound from my vocal in the verses .
It is a song with a journey , it crescendos three quarters of the way through and then falls away right at the end .
It is about the fear of opening up your heart entirely to someone you know you are in love with , because it is at that point you become the most vulnerable .
I went through this last year in the earlier stages of my relationship with my boyfriend .
We 've all been there . ''
