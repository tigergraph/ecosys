This is a track from American rock band Linkin Park 's fourth studio album , A Thousand Suns .
The song finds Chester Bennington spitting lyrics about acid rain and anarchy .
A Thousand Suns was produced by vocalist Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin .
Shinoda told NME that the legendary producer urged the band to indulge in `` automatic writing '' .
`` We were having a ton of trouble with the vocal and lyrics on the song ` Blackout ' , so we asked Rick for his advice , '' Shinoda explained.The singer added : `` He suggested this technique he used with Johnny Cash and Neil Young , which basically means you get up on the mic and let the words flow .
Going in there and actually doing it was terrifying at first but then the words just started coming out of nowhere , it was really surreal .
It added a certain soul to the record and without that , I think it would have been really rigid and digital . ''
