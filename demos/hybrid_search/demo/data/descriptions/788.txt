This is a track from the American hard rock band Rev Theory 's third studio album , Justice .
Vocalist Rich Luzzi explained the song 's meaning to Artist Direct : `` Everybody has a good and a bad side .
If you read into it , the chorus says , ` Do n't let the sun go down . '
When the sun goes down , that 's when the party begins and the demons come out .
You 're trying to be as good as you possibly can but the inevitable could happen .
It 's innately there .
Sometimes people have rubber arms .
They do n't have the strong will necessary to not submit to those demons .
There 's always that person who 's going to twist the arm .
Rarely , do you find the person who 's going to say , ` Hey bud , you should n't do this . '
Most of the time , it 's going to be , ` Do n't worry about it !
Come on ; let 's go ! '
Misery loves company -LSB- Laughs -RSB- . ''
