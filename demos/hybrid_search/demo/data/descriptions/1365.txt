This song was formerly known as `` Dancer '' but Animal Collective re-titled it as a result of The Killers ' recent `` owning '' of that particular word on `` Human . ''
Dave `` Avey Tare '' Portner told the French magazine VoxPop why this is the opening track on Merriweather Post Pavilion : `` We used the tour to test these new songs , and naturally , we always played ` In The Flowers ' at the start .
It was therefore said that this piece would make a good opening on the album .
Its construction is perfect for this : the slightly quiet atmosphere at the beginning and then the explosion in the middle .
And then the fact that the album opens with the somewhat `` complex '' melody , with the feeling of deconstruction , it forces the listener to attention . ''
