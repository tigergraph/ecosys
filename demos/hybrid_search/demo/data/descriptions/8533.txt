Leftwich discussed this song in an interview with The Sun : `` The lyrics are a reference to another time .
I 've good memories of recording that track because we were thinking of dropping it from the album but we rewrote it and put some instruments on it , changed the tune and rewrote some of the lyrics and now it 's one of my favorite tracks . ''
