This feel-good summer track by Synthpop act Owl City , aka Adam Young , is a duet with Canadian pop singer Carly Rae Jepsen .
The Minnesota native wrote the song in the early months of 2011 , when it was anything but summer outside .
He told MTV News that he wanted to craft a tune that `` anybody from any walk of life can sing . ''
When asked about working with Jepsen , Young replied , `` I love Carly 's song ` Call Me Maybe . '
I remember hearing it for the first time and immediately became a huge fan of hers -- it is absolutely contagious .
A bit later , I actually found out that she had known of my music for a while and even went to a couple of shows of mine in Vancouver so I definitely knew I wanted to collaborate with her . ''
The song 's music video was shot in early July 2012 at a lakeside spot in upstate New York .
It follows Carly Rae and her friends heading to a camping spot in the woods just as Young and his pals happen to be driving to the same location .
Regarding the The Midsummer Station album title , Young told AOL Music that it is , `` Purely imagery . ''
He explained : `` To me it 's like , I have this place in my head that is ambiguous and safe .
It 's this idealist , surreal , perfect world .
I think everyone needs that . ''
The song topped the singles charts in several countries including New Zealand , South Korea and Jepsen 's native Canada .
Apparently the `` Fireflies '' singer had a good time collaborating with the `` Call Me Maybe '' star .
Young told MTV News : `` I feel like every artist is inherently granted one shot to sing about having a good time in his or her life , and six months ago , I realized I had n't cashed in my chips yet .
So I thought , ` I 'm gon na sit down and I 'm gon na give this a shot ... and get my friend Carly to sing on it ' .
The final product rarely exceeds your expectations , and this thing just kind of happened . ''
Young and Jepsen had n't met before the recording of `` Good Time . ''
Owl City manager Steve Bursky and Scooter Braun , who is the head of Jepsen 's U.S. label , Schoolboy Records , introduced the pair .
The two impresarios were childhood pals , growing up together just outside of New York City and they later reconnected in 2009 .
The song features additional vocals by The Minneapolis Youth Choir and Young 's friend Matthew Thiessen , who is the frontman of Christian rock band Relient K. Thiessen has collaborated on a number of other Owl City tracks , including the # 1 single `` Fireflies . ''
Alabama singer/songwriter Ally Burnett sued the song 's writers Young , Matt Thiessen and Brian Lee , claiming that that copied a prominent motif of her 2010 recording , `` Ah , It 's a Love Song , '' from her album The Takeover .
Burnett 's lawsuits alleges that a `` unique vocal motif '' from her song is repeated throughout `` Good Time , '' and `` has a catchy pop vibe that both draws people in and sticks in people 's heads .
`` Burnett also claimed that she has `` suffered emotional and psychological damage '' as fans accused her of copying `` Good Time .
`` The lawsuit then becomes particularly arcane on points of musicology and composing regarding the alleged similarities of the two songs , claiming they share `` identical pitch sequence ... melodic contour ... rhythmic construction ... -LSB- and -RSB- timbre . ''
