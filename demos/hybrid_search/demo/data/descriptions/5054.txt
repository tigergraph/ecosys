This song mines similar acoustic-electric territory to the album 's American lead single , `` Since We 've Been Wrong . ''
In interviews the American progressive rock duo have spoken of Octahedron as `` acoustic '' and `` mellow . ''
This is Fake DIY asked guitarist and songwriter Omar Rodriguez-Lopez if this was a conscious decision ?
He replied : `` The conscious effort was to make it the complete opposite of what our records have been and particularly our last record was , which was a batch of some of the most frantic and the most complicated songs that I 'd made in a while .
This was a natural way to go .
It 's an acoustic-inspired record .
At the time I was listening to a lot of Nick Drake , Syd Barrett and Leonard Cohen , so I had them in my head and inspiring me .
I always knew that where it would end up it would be completely different .
The thing is when you 're an acoustic artist , songs are more to the point -- it 's just guitars , voice and the basic chord structure , so that was a springboard . ''
