This song was intended for Johnny Cash .
On Coldplay 's `` Twisted Logic '' tour , Chris Martin explained that this song was written for a special event and was to be performed by Cash and Coldplay together .
Unfortunately , Johnny Cash passed away before this event could be finalized .
Chris Martin told Rolling Stone July 14 , 2005 that both `` A Message '' and this song came from his religious upbringing .
Said Martin : '' ' A Message ' is taken from a hymn we used to sing called ` My Song Is Love Unknown , ' and we 'd say ` kingdom come ' every week in the Lord 's Prayer .
One of the great things about being forced to go to church services is that we 'd sing all these big songs .
That 's partly why I 'm obsessed with getting everyone to sing along at our shows .
It makes me feel like I 'm a part of something . ''
This is a hidden track .
It is represented on the X&Y package by a '' + '' sign on the back the case .
