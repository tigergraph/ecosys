This is the first single and opening track from British Nu Rave band Klaxons ' second album , Surfing The Void .
The lyric , `` Numberless names within the force of the ninth wave '' is a reference to The Ninth Wave , an 1850 painting by Russian marine artist Ivan Aivazovsky depicting sailors clinging to the mast of a submerged ship after a violent sea storm .
In this song the line is used within a sci-fi context.The lyric might also be referring to these lines from Alfred , Lord Tennyson 's , The Coming of Arthur : Wave after wave , each mightier than the lastTil last , a ninth one , gathering half the deepAnd full of voices , slowly rose and plungedRoaring , and all the wave was in flame.Incidentally , the second side of Kate Bush 's 1985 album Hounds of Love is entitled `` The Ninth Wave , '' from Tennyson 's poem .
