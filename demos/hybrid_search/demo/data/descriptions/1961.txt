Aldean told Billboard magazine that this Rhett Akins and Ben Hayslip tale of a contemporary romance , `` came in really late . ''
He added : `` I got an email , I think from Rhett , and it had that song in it , and I downloaded it on my phone and played it riding in my truck .
I thought , ` that 's pretty cool ' but we basically had the record cut , we were done .
I kept listening to it , and we were talking about going back in and cutting a few more songs , so I called Rhett and said , ` they , let me have this song for a minute . '
We put it on hold , and when we went back in , that was the first song we cut . ''
The song 's music video was filmed while Aldean performed at the University of Georgia 's Sanford Stadium , as part of his Night Train to Georgia tour .
The Georgia native was the first artist to perform a show in the venue .
`` I did n't want to pick a handful of stadiums just to say we were going to play stadiums , I wanted to play places that were special to me , and places that I really dug , '' he said .
`` Being from Georgia and being a big -LSB- University of -RSB- Georgia fan , this was number one on my list , but they 've never had a show here , so it was one of those things , ` That would really be cool , but they 've never done it before and I do n't know if they 'll let us do it . ' ''
The song slowly grew on Aldean the more he listened to it .
`` Rhett Akins , one of the writers on it , pitched it to me , '' he explained to Radio.com . ''
-LSB- And -RSB- as time went on I liked it enough to put it in the show .
And the reaction we got there was great . ''
