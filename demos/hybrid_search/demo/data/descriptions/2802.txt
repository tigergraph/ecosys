Empire Of The Sun close their Ice On The Dune album with this big ballad , which features a Gospel choir .
Frontman Luke Steele told Rolling Stone the group envisioned the R&B jam as a `` public service announcement '' to their fans .
`` We got through all these trials and tribulations , but you just have to remember that we 'll be there , keeping watch , '' he said .
`` Just go put on the record , and we 'll sing to you . ''
