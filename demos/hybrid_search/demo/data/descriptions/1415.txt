This romantic Pop tune finds Bowie singing of a smitten lad .
`` Who 'd have ever dreamed , '' he marvels wistfully , `` that a smalltown girl like you would be the boss of me ? ''
Producer Tony Visconti told Rolling Stone : `` That is one of the slower , funky ones .
It 's really solid .
There 's a little Young Americans in there .
But that 's really not proper ... It 's a new kind of direction for him , melodically .
Does n't sound like typical Bowie , that track .
But it 's a very good track . ''
