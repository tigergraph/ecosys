This song was co-produced and co-written by Swedish producer Max Martin , who has worked with Kelly Clarkson , Pink and Britney Spears amongst others .
CMT asked Underwood if she had any idea how the song would turn out when those Bright and Martin got together ?
She replied : `` No !
-LRB- laughs -RRB- And you never know when you work with somebody new , no matter who it is .
You always just wonder if it 's going to work out .
But you never know unless you try .
And it really did .
It came together and it ended up sounding so fresh and so different than anything I 've done and that I 've heard anybody else do .
So it was a lot of fun , meeting new people . ''
The song 's main riff is played on a mandolin and steel guitars are utilized as well .
In an interview with CMT News , the interviewer expressed surprise about hearing such traditional country instruments in the song since it was produced by a Swede .
Underwood responded : `` Well , it was actually produced by Max Martin and Mark Bright .
When you get something like that together , it 's like they 're superheroes and they 're combining forces to make something really great .
So , yeah , we brought him in to my world .
And I think it worked out really well . ''
