This ethereal , blurry ballad features both guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim singing in unison .
`` It 's one of the ones where I push myself the most to really sing , '' said Madley-Croft to Spin magazine .
`` Playing live so much , I got more confident with my singing . ''
The song 's production includes floaty siren-like whistling sounds .
DJ-producer Jamie Smith noted to Spin that for this , `` I was experimenting with weirder electronic-music things . ''
