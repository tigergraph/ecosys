This is the first single from Shout it Out , the eighth album by American pop rock band Hanson .
Zac Hanson told the story of the song to AntiMusic : `` Thinking ` Bout Somethin' ' originally started as a chorus .
We did n't know where it was going to go , and it sat around for a long time .
In the past , we 've had a lot of ideas that have stuck around and you just keep singing them and singing them .
The idea eventually came about of it as a kind of ` done me wrong ' soul song .
Someone found a similar loop to my drum part and we started rocking out to that , and then I went and jumped on the drums .
It really came together once we all settled around the idea of what the song was really about .
So much of it is based around the groove and chorus , and the verse was just about the attitude .
Once we got the attitude of the song , it was easy . ''
The song 's music video was shot on March 6 , 2010 and directed by Todd Edwards , co-founder of Blue Yonder Films .
It was filmed at Greenwood Avenue in the band 's hometown of Tulsa .
The clip recreated a much-loved scene of the classic movie The Blues Brothers and starred a cast of over 300 local extras together with a guest appearance by `` Weird Al '' Yankovic .
Zac Hanson explained to The News On 6 : `` The video is essentially recreating ` Shake Your Tail Feather ' from The Blues Brothers , a great scene with Ray Charles .
It 's Chicago in the movie , but it 's Tulsa for us . ''
