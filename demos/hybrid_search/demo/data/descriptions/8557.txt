On this collaboration with The-Dream , Snoop sings of the love for a good woman .
Malice N Wonderland is split into two sections , with the first half being the `` Malice '' with gritty , dark , gangsta lyrics and content while the other half is the `` Wonderland , '' showing Snoop 's fun-loving and light-hearted flows , including this track .
He explained to The London Times December 4 , 2009 : `` When the record starts off you can tell I 'm rapping with a lot of bad energy in my heart .
So that 's the first half , that 's ` Malice . '
By the time I get midway through the record it tones down and takes on a different direction , and by the end I find myself in ` Wonderland . '
And you know , that 's for the ladies .
I been calling women ` bitches ' and ` hos ' my whole career and I did n't make songs for them .
So I took time to give them that love and respect on this record . ''
