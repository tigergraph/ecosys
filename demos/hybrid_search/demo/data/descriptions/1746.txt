Romance is one of the main subjects Stone has written and sung about in the past , and there are several such songs on Colour Me Free , including this one .
She admitted to The Daily Record : `` A lot of different things inspired me .
There was one particular bloke who inspired some songs , and another one who inspired the others . ''
The singer added : `` I have n't had a boyfriend for a long time but I have fallen in love and out of love as young chicks do .
I do n't know if it was real love .
It ca n't possibly have been .
The songs are all about a particular person , but I do n't really write songs unless I have something to write about .
I also write about other people and their stories , too . ''
