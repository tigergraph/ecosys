Caitlin Rose penned this cut with Gary Louris from the Jayhawks .
Asked by Billboard magazine about the song 's meaning , Rose replied : `` I do n't know how to explain it , as it gets me in a pickle .
I guess it 's about the person who does n't have any fun at the party , but still sends you a thank you note . ''
Caitlin 's mom is Liz Jones , the Grammy-winning songwriter who has co-composed many of Taylor Swift 's hits .
