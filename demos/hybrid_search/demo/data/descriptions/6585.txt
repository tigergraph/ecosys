This song reflects on the disappointment of finding your youthful ire dampened by middle age .
Frontman Guy Garvey explained to Q magazine : `` You lose your pushy side when you hit middle age .
You ca n't keep partying like we have for 20 years .
I used to love running into a crowded rock 'n' roll bar and spending all night throwing shapes -LRB- British term for dancing -RRB- and looking at girls .
Now we love nothing more than the corner of a quiet pub , and a bloody good chat . ''
