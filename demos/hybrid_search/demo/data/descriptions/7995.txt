Craig Morgan penned this fiddle-tinged tribute to a small-town upbringing with longtime creative partner Phil O'Donnell and Craig Wiseman .
The singer told Yahoo !
Music : `` That was an easy song to write .
Kind of about where we 're from .
Where I live , you always see a whole lot more trucks than you do cars .
And here again , it 's just talking about the kind of people that we are . ''
Morgan spent ten years in the United States Army , serving in the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions , before launching his music career .
He references his time in the military on this cut .
Said Morgan to Yahoo !
Music : `` What I love about this song is where I threw in a bit of a tribute to the military without making it the major source of content .
Having been in the military , I never wanted anyone to think that I was taking advantage of my service , so I always try to steer clear of that sort of material to a degree .
And this was a song that I thought we got to pay tribute and talk about it , without it being the focal point . ''
