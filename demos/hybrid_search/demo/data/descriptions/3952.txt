This is one of three tracks on American Kid that features Patty Griffin 's boyfriend -LRB- later her husband -RRB- Robert Plant .
The Led Zeppelin frontman duets and gets a co-writing credit for rearranging the song .
`` We get a lot of energy from each other 's singing , '' she noted to Billboard magazine of Plant .
`` We both have similar places that we come from as singers-a lot of emotion , and sometimes the emotion overrides technique .
He inspires me .
He goes far and deep . ''
Griffin does n't make many music videos , but she commissioned one for this song .
Directed by Roy Taylor , the clip features scenery made from cut paper which came from history books .
Robert Plant also appears with Griffin in the video .
The song was inspired by the Toni Morrison post-Civil War set novel , Beloved .
The book tells the story of Sethe , a former slave living on the outskirts of Cincinnati , Ohio , who is haunted by Beloved , the reincarnation of her dead daughter .
The song went through several transformations before becoming the complete version that fans hear on her album .
