It was Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner who came up with the song title .
Frontman Josh Homme told NME : `` I called him one day a few years ago , when I was first starting to think about the possibility of getting to make a record and said ` hey man , give me a good line . ' ''
`` He hit me back and he was like `` kalopsia '' , and I said `` kalopsia , what the hell 's that ? ''
and he said `` it 's a condition wherein everything seems more beautiful than it actually is . ''
Homme produced the Arctic Monkey 's 2009 album , Humbug and also sung backup on their track `` All My Own Stunts . ''
Turner returned the favour by singing back up on the ... Like Clockwork track , `` If I Had A Tail . ''
Boneface created the animated video for the track .
The UK artist also provided the artwork for the ... Like Clockwork album .
Homme first came across Boneface in an American magazine called Juxtapoz .
Nine Inch Nails ' Trent Reznor supplied backing vocals for this tune .
`` I did n't know if I could make a record again , '' Homme told NME .
`` and I do n't know why , but I called Trent .
I wanted him to produce the record and I did n't have many songs or know what I was doing and was completely lost .
I just said , ` Man , you wan na have some coffee ? '
, and he came to my studio and we talked for about five and a half , six hours . ''
I talked to him about producing the record , '' he continued .
`` And then I went back into a like -LRB- acts decrepit -RRB- for a while , buzzing like a fridge I guess .
Then when I came back he was starting the Nine Inch Nails record so he did n't produce my record , but he helped me a lot . ''
