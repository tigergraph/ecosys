The lyrics for this song contain vocalist Shimon Moore 's personal mantra : `` You better run as fast as you can Cause this world tries to stop you , stop you , stop you Whenever it can . ''
Moore confessed , `` I only subscribe to that half the time , so it 's good to have a song you can sing to yourself for inspiration as much as to your audience ! ''
