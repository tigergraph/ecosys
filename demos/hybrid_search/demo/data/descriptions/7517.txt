In the closing scene of The White Stripes ' documentary Under Great White Northern Lights , Meg is sitting at a piano beside Jack as he tinkles this song , tears rolling down her face .
Mojo magazine asked Jack why Meg was crying .
He replied : `` I could venture to guess , but I do n't think any of my guesses would come close to the real reason .
Either way , it shows that she 's alive and involved in the energy of what we put out together .
That 's what I could take from it . ''
