This song utilizes Cold War imagery alongside stories from Neil Tennant 's childhood .
Some bloggers have also interpreted this song as a dig at British immigration policies .
In the middle eight , Chris Lowe pops up and says `` who do you think you are , Captain Britain ? ''
This was first time Lowe 's voice had been heard on a Pet Shop record since `` I Believe In Ecstasy , '' the hidden track on their 1993 album Very .
Lowe told Q magazine that his Pet Shop Boy partner Neil Tennant told him , `` to say that .
I 'd never heard of him . ''
Tennant then explained : `` It was scripted by me ` cos I was the London editor of Captain Britain at Marvel Comics . ''
