For some time British dance-pop singer-songwriter Sophie Ellis-Bextor has had to put up with an annoying text stalker who sends messages to her phone mainly consisting of jokes and song lyrics .
After getting one on her way to work one day Ellis-Bextor decided to pen a song about the text intruder with her songwriting colleagues Hannah Robinson and Liam Howe .
As to what the stalker might think of the song , Ellis-Bextor told Channel 4 's The 5 O'Clock Show : `` I never respond so they do n't know that I 'm receiving it .
People say , ` But surely now you 've written a song , they will know ! '
But they could be texting someone else .
It has n't been confirmed that it 's me they 're texting .
They do n't seem to know where I live '' .
