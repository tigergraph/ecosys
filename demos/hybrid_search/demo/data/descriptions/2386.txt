Jake Bugg told Q magazine that this was `` the hardest song to write , emotionally '' on his self-titled debut album .
He added : `` I was just sat by the fire one day .
With a guitar .
Its just about my emotions , at the time .
About a sequence of occurrences . ''
Bugg later teamed up with Rick Rubin for a new version of the song in the legendary producer 's Malibu studio .
The updated recording also includes drummer Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and string arrangements from Beck 's father David Campbell -LRB- Michael Jackson , Metallica , My Chemical Romance -RRB- .
`` When I first met Rick I was n't aware of all he had done and how well renowned he was but I think that helped and so I just cracked on and recorded my tunes , '' admitted Bugg .
`` The whole experience was inspiring .
I learnt a lot from Rick .
I also got the opportunity to work with some of the best players in the world which has made me become much better as well . ''
Bugg initially wrote this song in front of the fireplace at a girl 's house in Clifton .
He recalled to Q magazine that he played `` these mad chords '' as he sung random words .
`` the word ` broken ' kept coming out , so I thought me brain 's trying to tell me summ ' t there . ''
Bugg penned the guitar-led track with Crispin Hunt , who is best known for being the vocalist of The Longpigs .
The British alternative rock band had some success with songs such as `` She Said '' , `` On and On '' , both of which peaked at # 16 on the UK singles chart in 1996 .
Richard Hawley , who later found fame as a solo artist , was their guitarist .
Working with a professional vocal quartet on the Rick Rubin version of the song was a challenging experience for Bugg , who is n't musically trained .
He told Q magazine : `` It was a real learning experience to see how they worked .
The quartet would say mad things , like , I think you should remove those minor ninths from the seventh bar ... I did n't have a fu -- ing clue what they were talking about , I just put four chords together , know what I mean ? ''
