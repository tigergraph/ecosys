Running just 1:44 , this sound collage is the first track on Fear of a Black Planet .
Chuck D told Keyboard magazine how they put it together : `` A lot of the samples on ` Contract ' came from me taping radio stations , taking bites of interviews and commercials .
Sometimes I might go through the dial , just sampling at random , keeping it on a cassette , listen to the cassette , and say , ` Well , being that I 'm the lyric writer , how should I arrange these fragments so they 'll add up to a kind of a song ? '
That 's how ` Contract ' came along .
A lot of the time , Eric ` Vietnam ' Sadler , Hank -LRB- Shocklee -RRB- , Keith -LRB- Shocklee -RRB- , and I will be hanging , and I might be playing records , and we 'll take some bites and put them together and construct a groove .
We 've used the E-mu SP-12 and the Akai S900 a lot , of course .
We just started using a Macintosh for certain things -- tailoring samples and sequencing . ''
Explaining why this song opens the album , Chuck added : `` I know that things like that ca n't be over a minute and a half , two minutes ; they have to be short , and they have to lead violently into something that 's moving and funky in the mode that rap fans would expect .
That 's why you hear the voice say , ` There is something changing on the face of this planet today : Public Enemy , ' bam , bam , bam , samples coming up , and then bam !
, right into the jam , almost like four passes and a slam dunk .
If it does n't do that , you 'd lose 'em on the album . ''
