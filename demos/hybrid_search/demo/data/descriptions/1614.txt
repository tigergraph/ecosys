This was released as the lead single from Alternative Metal band Demon Hunter 's sixth studio album , True Defiance .
Frontman Ryan Clark told AntiMusic : `` This song was n't an immediate choice for the first single/video from this record ... but the more we discussed it , the more we were all really drawn to it .
I think it 's a unanimous favorite among the guys in the band - or at least in everyone 's top three . ''
The single was dropped on March 12 , 2012 .
Clark 's favorite part of the song comes courtesy of DH drummer Tim `` Yogi '' Watts .
He told Alternative Press : `` In the first chorus , the drums are playing the beat straight ... just riding on the crash cymbals .
In the second chorus , Yogi starts to throw in these tom accents every other measure ... and in the final chorus , every measure is filled with this killer tom pattern .
I just love how it gradually builds up to that point . ''
Clark told AntiMusic how he struggled to find one of the words for the first line of this chorus .
He recalled : `` For some reason I was having the hardest time filling in ` We were blinded by the ______ light . '
When I finally stumbled upon ` sacred , ' it was perfect .
It 's essentially the word I was looking for the whole time and I feel like it really brings life to that section . ''
Clark told Loudwire about the concept for the song 's music video : `` I came up with a basic concept/treatment and director , Robby Starbuck , injected some of his own creativity into it .
I essentially wanted to show the early days of our musical upbringing .
The teenage kids are loosely based on the five of us .
We did n't grow up together , but many of us grew up the same way -- into skateboarding , punk and heavy metal.The performance footage shows us playing in a typical rehearsal space with dingy walls , bad fluorescent lighting , band posters , etc. .
It 's meant to be a return to our roots . ''
Clark describes in this song the moment he realized that he wanted to be a musician .
He explained to Alternative Press : `` I call it a ` heritage ' piece , because it 's about growing up in the suburbs , spending most of my time skateboarding with friends , getting into trouble , not knowing what I wanted to do with my life ... and the moment that I found music , and everything changed .
I remember going to my first live show and just being enthralled by it all .
That 's what the song refers to when it says ` but the fear , the blood , the sweat and sound . '
It was the passion and the honesty of it that drew me in .
Ever since I was 15 , I knew that I 'd be doing music for the rest of my life . ''
Other working titles for the song , before Clark settled on `` My Destiny , '' included `` Stab , '' `` Blinded , '' and `` They Carried Us Away . ''
Clark -LRB- from AntiMusic -RRB- : `` The raspier , higher-pitched screaming vocals that you hear in the verses are something that I started playing with on ` This Is The Line ' from The World Is A Thorn .
There are certain parts -LRB- usually to do with time signature , tempo and guitar melody -RRB- that to me , just beg for a more villainous sounding vocal .
You 'll notice the second half of the verses on ` This Is The Line ' have a similar feel to these verses .
I do n't think this vocal style is necessarily pre-determined , but it just feels right for certain parts . ''
