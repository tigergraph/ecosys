This is the fourth single by French house duo Justice , from their second studio album , titled Audio , Video , Disco .
The single 's EP features remixes from DJ Falcon , fellow Ed Banger label mate SebastiAn , and A-Trak as well as a live recording of the track .
The song 's intro is a homage to AC/DC 's `` For Those About To Rock . ''
The song features a falsetto-vocal performance by Morgan Phalen of New York retro-rock band Diamond Nights .
Unlike most other successful dance acts , Justice 's collaborations with guest vocalists on Audio , Video , Disco were with unfamiliar to many singers rather than international superstars .
`` When we wrote the tracks they are singing on , it made us think of them , and they came to Paris to help us finish the lyrics , '' Justice 's Xavier de Rosnay told Papermag .
`` We never introduce things as ` featuring , ' because we do n't think it 's Justice featuring Morgan Phalen ; we really embrace the idea that Morgan Phalen is part of Justice , equally as much as we are .
With all of the guests , they feel like the third member of Justice throughout the process .
We understand the commercial appeal of having people that are really famous on the record , but this is something we are not really running after .
We just think it 's more fun to work with people we like . ''
The music video was shot by Spanish collective Canada , who are a trio of directors comprising Luis Cerveró , Nicolás Méndez and Lope Serrano .
We see two teams enter combat on motorcycles in an arena , a futuristic spin on American sports .
