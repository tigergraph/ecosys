This song is about the crimes of Charlie Manson and his followers .
In 1969 , they killed 5 people at the home of actress Sharon Tate -LRB- including Tate , who was pregnant -RRB- , then killed 2 more people the next day .
When he was brought to trial , it was clear that Manson was deeply disturbed and dangerous .
-LRB- thanks , Terry - Belleville , Canada -RRB- No Rest for the Wicked is the closest that Ozzy comes to a concept album .
Throughout , the songs shame and blame the various wrongdoings of their subjects - from Jimmy Swaggart in `` Miracle Man '' to his own fans for idolizing him with `` Hero . ''
So that 's how Manson fits in here as one of the bad guys .
Phil Alexander , Editor-In-Chief of Kerrang !
Magazine , contends that this song is about the Vietnam War , but it 's somewhat ambiguous - remember that `` Charlie '' is also the slang term for Viet Cong used by US servicemen in that war .
However , the lyrics make many references to the entire Manson incident .
Manson is thoroughly ingrained in music and celebrity culture , with an influence still felt today .
People forget these days that he personally knew both Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and Neil Young of Crosby Stills Nash & Young -LRB- whose song `` Revolution Blues '' .
Not to mention that he wrote a large body of songs , which have been covered by the likes of The Beach Boys and Guns 'n' Roses .
And after all , he resided in Topanga Canyon , California , where he hobnobbed with all these celebrities before killing some of them .
If this seems to be a shocking lapse in judgment , consider that stone cold psychopaths have a superficial charm to them at first , making them good at getting their foot in the door .
