DJ Munro and DC Joseph produced this track , which is from British soul and R&B singer Beverley Knight 's sixth studio album , 100 % .
Knight explained that this song is , `` about people who focus their envy of your progress onto you and your life , instead of concentrating on their own journey . ''
The song samples the Scottish band 's Orange Juice 's 1983 hit single `` Rip it Up . ''
Knight explained on her website that she has loved the song from childhood .
She added : `` I recently met Edwyn Collins , lead singer and composer of the band who went on to have huge success as a solo artist , and he loves what I have done with it !
It is total guitar led funk with a wicked sense of humour in the lyric ` get yourself a life - and make it work ! ' ''
For the single release of the song , a remix was created featuring British rapper Chipmunk performing over the original middle-eight section .
