The July 3 , 2009 issue of the London Evening Standard includes `` Debris '' in its London Calling 15 Capital Classics with the comment : `` East Ender Ronnie Lane locates his saddest love song by the Blitz-era rubble that hosts the Sunday morning market '' .
This is a fair description of this semi-acoustic track which includes a passable saxophone solo .
Ronnie Lane -LRB- 1946-97 -RRB- was born at Forest Gate , London , and romantic interests aside , `` Debris '' is a fairly obvious tribute to his East End/working class roots .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 2 -RRB-
