Henry Paul , founding member of The Outlaws , says this is another in their repertoire of songs about being on the road : '' ` Trying to get back to where I know I belong , ' there we are again , sitting in some stupid Days Inn in Tuscaloosa , Alabama , 1974 . ''
And even though they were doing something they loved , and on the edge of serious success , it did n't assuage the caged feeling of not being able to see their loved ones .
Says Paul , `` Even as much as you love your job , there 's things about that lifestyle that 'll make you do things you do n't want to admit that you did .
That 's why they throw TVs out of window .
That 's why the rock and roll thing is so violent and self-destructive .
It 's kind of like being a lab rat stuck in some treadmill hell , that in order to keep your sanity you 've got to lash out at what 's right immediately there , whether it 's your hotel room or shooting a TV or being Keith Moon over and over again .
But that 's where that song came from , and it had a very commercial appeal , and it was a single for us .
And although it did n't chart particularly high , it was obviously and definitely a cornerstone in our musical career . ''
This song 's chorus was written by Outlaws drummer Monte Yoho , and lead guitarist/singer Hughie Thomasson filled out the rest of the words .
Says Henry Paul , '' ` There goes another love song , ' that specific line , ` Someone 's singing about me again , now I need more than a friend , ' was written by Monte .
He was a man of very few words , our drummer .
He was a very smart and sharp , witty guy , but he was n't the most poetic character .
I 'm not trying to say that he was a dumb guy , just that his sense of poetry was on the target , but it was n't close to the center .
But he wrote that , and then Hughie sort of rounded out the song with the verses . ''
