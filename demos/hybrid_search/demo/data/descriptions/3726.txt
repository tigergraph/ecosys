Black Country Communion frontman Glenn Hughes has had a successful career as the lead vocalist for Black Sabbath during the mid 1980s , as well as playing bass and performing vocals for the Mk .
III and IV line-ups of Deep Purple .
However , despite knowing Jason Bonham since he was a child , he had never played with the drummer before the formation of Black Country Communion .
Hughes explained to Nightwatcher 's House of Rock : `` Here 's the thing .
I 've played with all the great rock drummers .
I played with Jason 's father .
So here I am , 40 years later , playing with his son .
I 've known Jason from before he even remembers me .
I 've been his ` Uncle Glenn ' forever .
Now I 've been given the keys to take care of John 's boy .
I 'm very protective of Jason .
We have a very strong family thread because of his dad.Locking in with Jason ... The first song that we recorded was ` Stand -LRB- At The Burning Tree -RRB- ' that first day .
When we counted it off , and he came in playing 1/2 time , it was like ` Okay , this is just supposed to be this way . ' .
He 's a very musical boy .
He challenges you absolutely .
And I love a good challenge .
I also love the fact that we can agree to disagree .
-LRB- Laughs -RRB- . ''
