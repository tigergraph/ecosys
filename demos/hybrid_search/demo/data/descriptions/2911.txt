Vocalist Justin Furstenfeld wrote this song on the road inspired by being `` with someone who treats me completely great . ''
He told Playback : '' There 's nothing negative about it .
It 's all about beauty .
It 's really , really pretty and really , really happy , but it 's going to be rocked out so crazy that people will kind of forget that it 's a lovey lovey dovey song , ''
