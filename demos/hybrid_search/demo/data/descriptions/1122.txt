This song is about groupies who try to very hard to get some time with the male members of No Doubt .
Lead singer Gwen Stefani says these ladies are much worse than the male fans who like her .
As the only girl in the group , she sees what happens backstage as her band mates entertain their female fans .
Reggae musicians Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare -LRB- Sly and Robbie -RRB- produced this .
They were session musicians for years , providing Reggae rhythms for Bob Dylan , Grace Slick , and The Rolling Stones , among others .
Stefani claims the band writes songs for themselves , not their fans .
This won the 2002 Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Performance By A Duo Or Group .
No Doubt performed on the show before they won -- they had the unenviable task of going on after Simon and Garfunkel reunited to perform a moving rendition of their classic `` The Sound Of Silence . ''
Both acts were introduced by actor Dustin Hoffman , and while Hoffman was quite familiar with Simon and Garfunkel -LRB- he starred in The Graduate , which they contributed to -RRB- , he apparently knew little about No Doubt .
When he introduced them , he said that his daughter had coached him on their music and sort of sang a little of this , except he sang `` Say Baby '' instead of `` Hey Baby . ''
Hoffman is clearly more comfortable at the Oscars , he also called Bruce Springsteen `` Bruce Springstreet . ''
Jamaican Reggae artist Bounty Killer does the rap on this song and is in the video .
In Jamaica , rappers are known as `` toasters , '' as rap began there when DJs spoke over records , which they called `` toasting . ''
This was the first single from the album .
It was released 15 months after their last one , Return Of Saturn , which was released 5 years after Tragic Kingdom .
At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards , this won for Best Pop Video and Best Group Video .
Backwards , `` Boys Say '' sounds like `` Yes Sir . ''
