This song is about AIDS , and about how before AIDS everyone used to have unprotected sex , but afterward everyone was scared of catching the HIV virus .
The line `` nobody cares 'til somebody famous dies '' is a reference to Queen singer Freddie Mercury , who died from AIDS the year before this song was released and spread awareness of how devastating the disease is .
