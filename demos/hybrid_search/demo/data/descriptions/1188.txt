After Rundgren had his big breakthrough hit with `` I Saw The Light , '' his record company -LRB- Bearsville/Warner Bros. -RRB- decided this should be the follow up single .
It bombed , so for the next single , they edited the LP version of `` Hello It 's Me '' and release it , providing Rundgren with a Top 5 hit .
`` Could n't I Just Tell You , '' while never a hit , became a huge FM staple and probably Todd 's most influential recordings as a solo artist .
