Like Tokio Hotel 's earlier song `` Monsoon , '' this song describes a feeling of being so weak , but sure that you and someone you 're far away from just have to hold on and will be together in the end -LRB- `` 1000 times against an endless tide , we 'll be free to live our lives '' -RRB- .
There is also an English version called `` 1000 Oceans . ''
-LRB- thanks , Cor - Columbia , SC -RRB-
