This track is a pairing of the Bright Eyes ' song `` Method Acting '' with Neil Young 's `` Cortez The Killer . ''
Dave Rawlings told Billboard magazine that the medley was inspired during a tour he did with Bright Eyes , for whom he 's contributed to a couple of albums .
`` One of the songs we played every night was ` Method Acting , ' which was always a song I responded to , '' Rawlings recalled .
`` I found myself sitting on a couch a year later , strumming it ... and at some point I realized it went into ` Cortez the Killer , ' which was a really important song for me when I was a teenager .
I have a really emotional attachment to both of those songs , so it 's nice to have versions of them out there .
It gives me a reason to sing them . ''
Rawlings told Billboard that Bright Eyes leader Conor Oberst also suggested the A Friend Of A Friend title for the project .
`` I thought it was nice and appropriate , '' Rawlings noted , `` because so many people I 've worked with over the years and played music with are represented in one way or another on the record . ''
Other musicians on the record include keyboardist Benmont Tench from Tom Petty 's Heartbreakers and keyboardist Nathaniel Wilcott of Bright Eyes .
