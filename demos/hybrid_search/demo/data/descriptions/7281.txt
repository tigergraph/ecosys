The music of School of Seven Bells has a dreamlike quality .
To help achieve that feeling for the lyrics , vocalist-keyboardist Alejandra Deheza looks for help from her collection of tarot cards .
This racing song from their third album , Ghostory , was inspired by the picture of The High Priestess from the Afro-Brazilian Tarot .
She explained to Spin magazine : `` The images are all taken from the stories of gods and goddesses in Santeria .
I chose it for the sheer awesomeness of the image .
I mean , c'mon .
This picture reminds me of a song towards the end of the album called ` White Wind . '
In this song , -LSB- the character -RSB- Lafaye is talking about this guiding spirit inside her that she ca n't ignore no matter how hard she tries , and it 's gon na wreak havoc until she pays attention .
It gets pretty serious . ''
Ghostory is the first SVIIB album to feature live drums , which were recorded by the band 's live touring drummer Chris Colley at the East Williamsburg studio My Active Driveway .
`` We 'd been blasting the demos in the van constantly , so Chris got to know them really well , '' explained Multi-instrumentalist Benjamin Curtis to SonicScoop : `` We had a six day break , so we popped into the studio and laid down the drum tracks really quickly .
There 's no desk in My Active Driveway , but as a far as microphones , preamps , and compressors , it 's like a kid in a candy store -- so beautiful and so much great stuff .
It was amazing .
`` He added : `` There 's a particular energy , and a manic , aggressive feeling/quality that you can really only get from a guy beating the s -- t out of some drums in a room . ''
