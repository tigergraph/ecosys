Braids vocalist Raphaelle Standell-Preston wrote this song about a breakdown she had while living in Montreal with her former flatmate Claire Boucher .
Name rings a bell ?
Claire Boucher records under the name of Grimes and her cut `` Oblivion '' was voted # 1 in Pitchfork 's list of Top 100 Tracks of 2012 .
Raphaelle told NME : `` I 'm in a good place now , but the song is about a particularly intense episode I had where I was convinced I was a fallen angel .
I was living with Grimes at the time and we did n't exactly stabilise one another .
We 're both really intense people . ''
