Drummer Cody Hanson told MTV News that he thinks a lot of people will relate to this track , `` because it 's a song about all those dumb things that you do when you 're young , and you just learn to embrace it , because that 's what happens in life - you learn from it , and things get better as you get older . ''
It can be hard for musicians to pick just one of their favorite songs from their own catalogues because their songs are so personal , but in 2012 , Cody Hanson told us that this was one of his picks .
The other Hinder songs that Hanson is most proud of are `` All American Nightmare '' and `` Better Than Me . ''
