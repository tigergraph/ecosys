A track from The Fratellis first album , this song is about a relationship between two very different people who just do n't get along .
Lead singer Jon Fratelli claims that he does n't have the life experiences to compose compelling narratives , so he makes up stories , which he did here .
An avid reader of fiction , Jon writes with lots of lyrical flourishes , using metaphor and double-meaning to enhance his lyrics .
An example on this song is the line `` She was into The Stones when I was into The Roses , '' which helps explain the chasm between the couple .
The Stones are The Rolling Stones - one of the most popular bands in Rock ; The Roses are The Stone Roses , who are much more of an acquired taste .
