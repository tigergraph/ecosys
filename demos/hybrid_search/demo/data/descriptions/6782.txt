Troop 41 is a rap trio based out of Raleigh , North Carolina comprising Tristian Brown -LRB- T-Breezy -RRB- , Lelynd Darkes -LRB- Lil Lee -RRB- , and Dakare Wilder -LRB- Lil Inferno -RRB- .
The trio met in 2005 at Ligon Middle School in Raleigh , North Carolina when they enrolled in a rap class .
Bonding over a love of music and basketball they formed a group and came up with the Troop 41 name .
This is their first single to enter the Hot 100 .
For those of you not au fait with sport , John Wall is the point guard for the NBA team Washington Wizards .
He was born and raised in Raleigh so is a local hero for the basketball-loving Troop 41 .
This song was inspired by Wall 's ` flexing of the arm ' dance that he did at one of his college basketball games when he was playing for the Kentucky Wildcats .
The rap trio explained to Bestnewbands.com : `` John Wall is a neighborhood friend of ours , and as you know , he did his ` flexing of the arm ' dance at one of his college basketball games .
There was so much talk about the dance here ... Everybody was doing it .
So , we thought to ourselves , ` everybody is doing this dance , but there is n't a song to go along with it . '
We contacted John and he was 100 % behind the idea . ''
So how did Troop 41 come up with their name ?
Its all down to simple arithmetic as the trio explained in an interview with Bestnewbands.com : `` When we first started , our ages were 14 , 14 , and 13 which equals 41 ... And we 're soldiers in this rap-game , fighting to get to the top .
Put that together , and you get Troop 41 .
It 's a different name , so it makes people want to learn more about you . ''
