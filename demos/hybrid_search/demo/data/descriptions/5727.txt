White closes his debut solo album , Blunderbuss , with this multi-tracked , psychedelic hoedown , which finds him singing of a man who , `` Ca n't catch a breath or a break .
Like a guy who is strangled or begging for help . ''
The female backing vocals are provided by Ruby Amanfu of `` Love Interruption '' fame , Laura Matula , who played piano on the former White Stripes frontman 's James Bond collaboration with Alicia Keys , `` Another Way to Die '' and White 's former wife , the British model and singer-songwriter Karen Elson .
Speaking with KROQ 's Stryker , White explained this song contains the only portion of Blunderbuss that was n't written at the time of the making of the album .
`` There was only one thing that had been around for a long time which was the opening piano line to the song ` Take Me With You When You Go , ' '' he said .
`` It 's a piano thing I 've been playing for like ten , twelve years ... every time I sit down at the piano I play this thing .
I always thought it was some song that I heard somewhere , a big band radio station from the 40s .
I had n't heard it in ten years so I figured maybe it 's mine and I finally recorded it . ''
White explained to Mojo why he utilized female backing vocals on many of Blunderbuss ' tracks .
`` Some songs might sound like the male character is upset at some woman , -LRB- but -RRB- I ca n't sing from a woman 's point of view , so I fall back on the standard blues way of male versus female , or male versus the world .
I use that as my door into the song . ''
Jack White was always going to make this Blunderbuss ' closing track .
He told UK newspaper The Sun : The sequence is my favourite part of making an album .
` Take Me With You When You Go ' -LRB- with its rocking finale -RRB- could only go at the end .
There 's nowhere else it would fit .
It 's so funny when songs tell you where they should go . ''
