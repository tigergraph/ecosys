This kiss-of song is based on real life events .
The Boot asked Buxton if she got into trouble with her ex for airing dirty laundry .
She replied : `` I was in the relationship when I wrote ` Space ' - we had n't broken up yet .
He 's a musician , so he understands that I 've got ta write songs !
I do n't think he took offense , but I do think it was eye-opening to him .
And then I really did move out , so ` there 's your space !
` That 's what songs are for - to make sense out of situations and to make a piece of art from it .
Art imitates life . ''
