This is the fifth single from R&B artist Trey Songz 's third studio album , Ready .
The song 's music video was filmed in New York and directed by Yolande Geralds .
Songz told MTV News about the clip : `` I wanted it to be sexy , adult , everybody having fun in the video .
The song speaks on more so a club atmosphere , but the video is more lofty - sexy women all over the place , adults having fun .
This one lady in particular , she 's representing the independent women without taking it over the top .
She 's got her own .
She takes me back to her crib - so we invent sex together . ''
A unique interpretation sung by the Sacramento songstress Lindsey Pavao during the Blind Auditions section of the second series of The Voice made the judges ` say aah ' and earned her a place on Christina Aguilera 's team .
It also sold enough copies to debut at # 80 on the Hot 100 .
The song features Fabolous .
Songz also collaborated with the rapper on `` Last Time , '' a track from Fabolous ' 2009 album Loso 's Way .
This was a lucky thirteenth chart entry for Trey Songz as it was his first title to reach the Top 10 of the Hot 100 .
