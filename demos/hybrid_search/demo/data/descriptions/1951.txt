This is the first single from the album Tomorrow Morning by Eels , an American rock band formed and fronted by singer/songwriter Mark Oliver Everett .
The record is the third in a trilogy of concept albums also including Hombre Lobo and End Times .
Whilst Hombre Lobo dealt with desire and unrequited love and End Times with themes of aging , divorce and loss , Tomorrow Morning is a redemptive collection of songs , in which Everett expresses a more optimistic outlook .
In this song , for instance , he proclaims that `` now I 'm feeling sweet , back on my feet . ''
The three albums change musically as well as thematically .
Everett explained to Spinner UK how the musical aspect of each album reflects that particular record 's concept .
Said the Eels mainman : `` Well , for Hombre Lobo , the idea of desire and lust equaled the electric guitar .
And for End Times , for loss , I thought it should be more of a traditional singer-songwriter , alone in his basement with an acoustic guitar approach .
And then , with Tomorrow Morning originally , my idea was I wanted to do a very warm album , a celebration of the things I like about life and the world .
I also had always wanted to make an album that was pretty electronic , but I always thought that would be a colder kind of album because of the nature of the sound - the kind of music that is normally made with those instruments .
And then one day it occurred to me : What if I combine these two ideas ?
The electronic idea and the warm , celebration idea .
And then I got excited because then it kinda becomes its own thing . ''
