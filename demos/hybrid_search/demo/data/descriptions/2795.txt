`` I love this song , '' Jake Owen told us .
`` A lot of people do n't ever ask me about that song . ''
So we 'll let Jake tell the story : `` It was on my first record , and it was actually the first song I ever wrote in Nashville with two other people .
I wrote it with my producer , and the first time I ever met this guy named Kendall Marvel .
He came in , I 'd never met him before , and Jimmy told me all about him and said he was a good guy , and he 'd get what I do.I used to like Merle Haggard - I mean , I still like Merle Haggard - but he had a song back in the day , it was called ` Going Where The Lonely Go . '
And it was kind of like a ... -LRB- singing -RRB- ` Rolling with the flow ... ' and it just had this kind of easy feeling to it .
But it was a song about love lost and going where the lonely go .
I wanted that same feeling , and I had this little melody and I played it .
I just had that first line , -LRB- singing -RRB- ' I lived all my life , ' and it 's cool - Kendall came in and he was like , ' I love that . '
And we just started taking it from there.And there 's really only a first verse and a chorus to that song .
There 's an instrumental , and then there 's a chorus again .
And it does n't say a whole lot .
Just this guy saying he lived his whole life and no ties ever bound him , and he never thought he 'd be able to settle down until he did find her , and she said essentially -- and I 've done this in my life , I 've had a girlfriend tell me before , ` You 're too busy in what you 're doing .
If you do n't show me some sort of attention in other aspects of the relationship , then it is n't gon na happen . '
And sure enough , I ignored it , and she went away .
And I regret that .
And that song has a lot of regret in it .
But I think it really represents a great melody , and a great country song .
It just sounds very timeless . ''
