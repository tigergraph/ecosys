Brice penned this cut with frequent collaborator Jon Stone and Country music artist Jerrod Niemann , who is best known for his hit single `` Lover Lover . ''
Brice recalled the tune came easily .
`` We sat down , and that song just fell out of us in a couple of hours .
It was like magic , '' he said.Once Brice got into the studio , the song only needed a couple of tweaks from his original demo version .
`` Same as with ' A Woman Like You , ' it 's my demo that we upgraded to master with just a couple of minor changes , '' he said .
`` It has that ` alt ' thing about it .
Musically , it 's my heart , just really , really me .
That 's where I live and love . ''
