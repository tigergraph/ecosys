Lead vocalist Hannah Blaylock said regarding this cut : `` A good song takes you on a journey .
The story depicts such sharp imagery that when I heard it I felt like I had lived the story myself .
There are those precious times when a song stops you in your tracks and moves you in a way that you ca n't explain . ''
`` Songs like this are the ones that remind us all of the power of music , '' she continued .
`` This song is exactly that for me .
Our beloved Laura Veltz showed me this song that she wrote and I was floored .
She kept it for us for over a year and a half so we could put it on our record .
We can not show her enough love and thankfulness for giving us such a priceless gift and letting us partake in such a breathtaking piece of art . ''
