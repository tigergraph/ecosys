This instrumental was a late addition to True Defiance .
It came about when guitarist Patrick Judge and lead vocalist Ryan Clark sat down in the studio with a couple of acoustic guitars and no real expectations .
The result was this reflective piece that they decided had to find a place for on the record .
Clark told Alternative Press : `` I 've always appreciated a good stripped-down instrumental track on a metal record .
Some of my favorite records have tracks like this -- At The Gates ' Slaughter Of The Soul , Sepultura 's Chaos AD , Metallica 's ... And Justice For All and quite a few others.Listening back to it after we 'd finished , I feel like it almost has a Kill Bill vibe to it ... like a creepy old western .
Somehow I think it fits the vibe and flow of the record really well . ''
The song is played in the key of E so that it segues naturally into the next track on the record , `` We Do n't Care . ''
Clark explained to Alternative Press : `` When we were writing the song , the guitars were in standard tuning .
We wanted this song to bleed into whatever came next ... almost as if it were the intro to the following song .
We realized that the only song on the record that started with an E chord -LRB- the root note in this song -RRB- was ` We Do n't Care . '
So essentially , we kept the song in the key of E as a way to line it up with the next song .
In short , the song itself is actually the means to an end . ''
