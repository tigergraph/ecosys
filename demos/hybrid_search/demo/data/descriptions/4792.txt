D.A. Wallach and Maxwell Drummey got into a `` screaming match '' because of this song .
Drummey confessed to Complex Magazine : `` We were wrapping up some recordings and were re-doing a few things and I woke up early one morning and made a demo of that verse riff and hated it like real bad .
Then D.A. heard it and was like , ` That 's super hot , lets make that ! '
and I was like , ` No ... ' ''
