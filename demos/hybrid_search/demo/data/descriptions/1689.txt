This tune originally featured on Peter Kay 's Britain 's Got the Pop Factor ... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice , a comedy on the UK 's Channel 4 television channel which poked fun at reality talent shows .
This was the song performed by the two fictional finalists , which was won by an overweight Irish transsexual Geraldine McQueen , played by the comedian Peter Kay .
Peter Kay , together with Take That singer and songwriter Gary Barlow , penned this .
The song craftily pokes fun at the `` my life is going to change forever '' sentiments , frequently employed in the empowering anthems typically sung as the coronation song on reality talent shows .
This also employs halfway through two key changes , again a popular trick of modern pop songs .
This song was released as a single in the UK the same week as the 2007 X-Factor winner Leon Jackson released the first single from his debut album , `` Do n't Call This Love . ''
To the amusement of many , this spoof number debuted at # 2 one position higher than the song of the actual winner of the X-Factor reality talent show .
Geraldine sent a consolatory message to Jackson saying : `` Leon is a lovely wee boy .
He 's a Scottish Michael Buble . ''
This was Peter Kay 's third successful single releasing after teaming up with Tony Christie in 2005 for the chart-topping Comic Relief song `` Is This the Way to Amarillo '' and two years later again reaching # 1 with his collaboration with The Proclaimers , a revival of their `` I 'm Gon na Be -LRB- 500 Miles -RRB- .
