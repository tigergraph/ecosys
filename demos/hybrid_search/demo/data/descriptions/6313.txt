This song was inspired by a trip that Cocker took in the company of 39 other musicians , writers and filmmakers on a boat sailing to the North Pole .
The purpose of their journey was to help highlight global warming and the organizers hoped that the experience would inform some of their subsequent art .
Cocker told The Independent May 9 , 2009 that he guessed the song , `` tangentially , does relate to global warming , because slush is what snow turns into , and nobody likes that .
Presumably , then , nobody would want the North Pole to turn into a dirty great lump of the stuff either , right ? ''
