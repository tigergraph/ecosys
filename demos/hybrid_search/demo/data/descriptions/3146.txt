We hear at the beginning of this song a sample from the documentary Backstage , which chronicled the 1999 Hard Knock Life tour and featured live performances by several members of Def Jam 's roster .
Cole explained to Billboard magazine : `` It 's a Jay-Z sample .
It 's -LSB- from -RSB- the movie Backstage , where he 's like , ` Somebody right now 's eating a bowl of Apple Jacks . '
He was speaking while he was out there on tour , becoming the hottest rapper in the game .
There was somebody right now that was just working on their raps , eating Apple Jacks and coming for his spot .
And he was like , ` I 'm gon na find 'em though , I 'm gon na sign 'em , I do n't want no problems . ' ''
The phrase `` Rise and shine '' meaning `` get out of bed '' is commonly preceded by `` wakey , wakey . ''
It was originally a military command at the start of the 20th century and alludes to the rising of the sun .
The song contains a sample of `` Arise , Shine '' by Greg Dykes and The Synanon Choir from their 1969 rock jazz cantata , The Prince of Peace .
