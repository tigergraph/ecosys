Win Butler revealed in a Rolling Stone article that `` Antichrist Television Blues '' was largely inspired by Joe Simpson , the father and manager of Jessica and Ashlee .
Drummer Jeremy Gara told popmatters.com : `` It could be about other people , too , but it definitely applies to that family 's dynamic .
We have n't heard from their camp at all , which is great , because some people we 've worked with have worked with them and said you definitely do n't want to cross them . ''
