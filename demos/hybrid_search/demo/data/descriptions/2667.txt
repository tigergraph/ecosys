PWT 's vocalist and songwriter Tom Higgenson told Alternative Press magazine why this song nearly did n't make it onto The Wonders of the Younger : '' ` Last Breath ' is a hopeless song about a relationship that sucks the life right out of you .
The relationship started out great , but now it 's a struggle to get back to those good times .
This song was so dark and personal that I actually did n't want it on the album .
Tim -LSB- Lopez , guitar -RSB- loved it , and he got everyone else in the band on board .
Reluctantly , I gave in and agreed to record it , fighting and bitching the whole time about how it did n't belong on the record .
I do n't usually admit this , but I was wrong . ''
