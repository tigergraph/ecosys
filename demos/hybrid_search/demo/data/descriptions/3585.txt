R&B and hip-hop producer Teddy Riley worked on many of the songs on Dangerous .
He commented to Musicradar.com : `` I really admire the work that went into this track .
Anything Michael does , I can admire .
It does n't really remind you of any of his other songs ; this one 's a bit different to his usual tracks but it stands out .
Michael 's always innovative .
With this track , I just think he went another way due to the structure of the track and the instruments used .
Well , that and him working with Glen Ballard with the writing on it -- they kind of went head-on with that track . ''
