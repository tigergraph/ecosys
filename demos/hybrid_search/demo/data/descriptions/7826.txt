This song is about Joan of Arc being burned at the stake , and her presumed lover -LRB- Gilles de Rais -RRB- going insane , becoming evil and committing countless crimes .
His lover died , hence `` The Death of Love . ''
The album is subtitled `` The Life and Crimes of Gilles de Rais . ''
-LRB- thanks , Alyx - Runcorn , United Kingdom -RRB-
