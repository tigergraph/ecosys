Issued addressed include The Iraq war , the disparity between rich and poor , and gas prices .
Linkin Park vocalist Mike Shinoda has described the song as a `` big middle finger to George Bush . ''
-LRB- thanks , Jake - Albuquerque , NM -RRB- Originally Linkin Park had not planned to perform this song at their June 2008 Milton Keynes gig , which was recorded for the band 's live album Road to Revolution : Live at Milton Keynes .
Mike Shinoda explained to Rolling Stone how this tune ended up as part of their set : `` We had put that song in the set and took it out because the chorus has 10 voices singing on it , and live it just never sounded right .
But during the Milton Keynes show , there was a fan in front of the crowd who had a sign that said `` Play ` Hands Held High . ' ''
Halfway through , I thought , we ca n't play the song because we are n't prepared - but I can give him the first half .
So I just threw the verse in a cappella .
In fact , we added that verse to the set , so that kid 's sign essentially changed the set for the rest of the year .
It was really cool . ''

magazine : `` Rick -LSB- Rubin -RSB- said to us that , if something sounded like it needed rapping , then we should try singing and vice versa .
That 's why this song has rapping on it . ''
