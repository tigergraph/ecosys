Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies tells the tales of several different American outlaws and gunslingers of the 19th century .
This song tells the true story of the noble lady outlaw Pearl Hart , who held up a stagecoach to buy medicine for her dying mother .
Armed with a Colt 44 , Pearl netted $ 430 .
Volbeat vocalist and guitarist Michael Poulsen told BraveWords.com how he learned of Pearl Hart 's story : `` I started writing those kinds of lyrics and I locked myself into this bubble .
It is a process where I read a lot of books and get inspired by movies .
When it comes to Pearl Hart , she was a character that I was reading about way back .
I had forgotten all about her , but when I started writing material for this new album , I wanted not only to bring up some of the legendary male gunslingers ; I wanted to look into the shady ladies as well .
I remembered reading about Pearl Hart , so I got back to some of the old books and there she was . ''
