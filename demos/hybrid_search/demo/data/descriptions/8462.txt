McCauley : `` I wrote this song for a friend of mine .
All of a sudden I was laying there one night and thought the first line has to capture everything .
I was staring at the clock and it was midnight , and I wrote , ` Midnight workings , weather down the storyline , I try to find the truth between all the lies ' and it all seemed to work . ''
This was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 movie Elektra .
