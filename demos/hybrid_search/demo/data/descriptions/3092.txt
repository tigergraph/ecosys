Paul Weller from Uncut magazine July 2008 : `` I 've recently developed a bit of a thing about tango .
I love that music .
It 's really emotional , passionate music .
And in soundchecks we often mess about with tango and bolero rhythms .
Again , Simon had a backing track and I had a tune in my head and we started jamming on it .
The melody is quite influenced by an Algerian singer called Souad Massi , who 's been a huge inspiration recently . ''
