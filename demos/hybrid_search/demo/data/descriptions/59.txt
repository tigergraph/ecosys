Eels mainman Mark Everett explained the song 's meaning to Spinner .
`` All any of us can do when our lives are n't working out is look at our own role in what 's not working , '' he said .
`` You ca n't do anything about any of the other parties involved .
But you can do something to change yourself in the name of getting to a better life .
That 's what this song is about .
If it 's not working out , make a new world by making yourself better .
In my case , I needed to rock while I did this . ''
