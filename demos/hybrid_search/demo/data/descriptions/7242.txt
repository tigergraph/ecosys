Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies tells the tales of several different American outlaws and gunslingers of the 19th century .
This song tells the story of John Henry `` Doc '' Holliday -LRB- 1851 -- 1887 -RRB- , an Atlanta dentist who moved to the American southwest after being diagnosed with tuberculosis in the hope that the climate would prolong his life .
He took up gambling as a profession and earned a national reputation as a gunman .
Holliday was a good friend of Wyatt Earp and participated with Earp and his brothers in the famous gunfight at the OK Corral .
Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies was Volbeat 's first album with guitarist and co-producer Rob Caggiano .
He told Artist Direct this song was pretty much together when he came on board .
Caggiano added : `` Obviously , we added all of the bells and whistles in the studio like the slide guitar and the banjo as well as the leads .
The structure was pretty much set . ''
