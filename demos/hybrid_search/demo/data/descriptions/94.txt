According to the March 1994 issue of the fanzine Nova Lepidoptera , this Les Holroyd composition is an `` up-tempo country-influenced number '' that could be about the end of a relationship , or about the band 's fans .
It was chosen as the follow up to the sometimes misconstrued John Lees song `` Hymn '' and was released in the UK on the Polydor label March 10 , 1978 backed by a live version of `` Suicide ? '' .
