This song plays at the end credits of The Smurfs 2 movie .
Britney had her own two children , Sean and Preston in mind when she agreed to record the tune .
`` I have always loved the Smurfs as a kid and now my boys are the biggest Smurfs fans EVER , '' she said .
`` I wanted to surprise them with a song in the movie .
I know they 'll think it 's Smurftastic ! ''
Britney is not the only music superstar to contribute to the movie - Katy Perry returns to repeat her role as the voice of Smurfette in the CGI sequel .
Britney explained the song 's meaning to Ryan Seacrest on his radio show .
`` It 's about feeling good , '' she said .
`` Like when a guy makes you giddy .
It 's more of a feeling .
When I eat chocolate I have that ` ooh la la ' feeling . ''
McKee 's contribution was to tweak the lyrics to make them family friendly .
`` I actually came in and was the doctor behind it .
A lot of it was already written .
It was a great song to begin with .
... They wanted it for the Smurfs movie , and it was originally pretty sexy , '' she recalled to MTV News .
`` I was like , ` OK , how do I take this sex-drenched song and make it Smurfs friendly ? ' ''
`` That was kind of my task , but it still had to work at radio and be something that people would buy as a Britney Spears song because she 's not a Smurf , '' McKee added .
`` So , it was just kind of fun to find double entendres to put in there and kind of trick the parents into thinking it 's kid friendly . ''
The song was penned by hitmaker Bonnie McKee -LRB- `` Hold It Against Me '' -RRB- along with J Kash , Lola Blanc and Fransisca Hall and produced by Spears ' Femme Fatale collaborators Dr. Luke , Ammo and Cirkut .
Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter Lola Blanc told Idolator : `` We originally wrote ` Ooh La La ' for me -- it was me , Fran Hall and Ammo .
I came up with the title , which was sort of a play on my name , and then Dr. Luke heard it and was like , ' I want this for Britney ! ' ''
Britney 's two sons , Sean and Jayden , made cameos in the song 's music video .
They were 7 and 6 years old at the time , a younger age than their mom when she made her showbiz debut on Star Search at the age of 10 .
Britney told Ryan Seacrest that during filming , her kids were pros .
`` They were actually really , really good on set , '' she told the radio presenter .
`` They were , like , acting , and my oldest son , Preston , was right on cue every time they would tell him to do something .
Later on I got to see what they actually did on camera and it was adorable . ''
Bonnie McKee and her frequent collaborator , Katy Perry , secretly recorded background vocals on the song .
Katy and Britney did n't meet as they laid down their parts separately .
