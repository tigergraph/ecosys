Mara Carlyle is a London-based classical-pop singer-songwriter , who is the child of musicians and was raised in Shropshire , England .
This song is from her debut album The Lovely , which was released on Matthew Herbert 's label , Accidental Records , in July 2004 .
The song accompanies the IKEA `` Happy Inside '' UK television commercial in which 100 cats are let loose in the company 's Wembley store .
The use of the song came at an opportune moment for Carlyle as the release of her second album , Nuzzle had been delayed by her record label and her career appeared to be stalling .
She told The Guardian : `` The Ikea advert came at a time when I was about to give up entirely .
The struggle to get my album out had taken over my life , so I had decided to forget about it and move on .
Then this came along , out of the blue . ''
