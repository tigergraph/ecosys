Nick Lowe told The A.V. Club that this song is a lighthearted look at death : `` It 's funny how that song seems to interest people , judging so far from the people I 've spoken to .
I try to avoid writing autobiographical songs .
I write about what I know , but I 'm one of those people , like Randy Newman , who make up a character and then make them say stuff .
It 's not really me ; it 's just a character I 've made up .
But this thing does actually say , ` I 'm 61 , and I thought I 'd never make 30 . '
And the reason for that is , I was sitting at home watching the television and fiddling around with the guitar , and I came up with a tune .
And I 'd just heard Johnny Cash singing , ` I 'm 61 years old , I never thought I 'd see 30 . '
I ca n't remember if those were the actual words , but that was the idea .
I just heard Johnny Cash sing that , and it just went from there .
I ca n't honestly say whether it 's morbid , in that , ` Here I am , considering the Grim Reaper tapping me on the shoulder .
It 's time for me to get my thoughts out . '
It 's much more joking for me , really . ''
The Old Magic was Lowe 's thirteenth solo album .
Lowe told The Huffington Post that `` Checkout Time '' was one of the first songs that he wrote for the record .
Lowe confessed to Terry Gross of Fresh Air that he did not think he would make it past 30 , as the lyrics state : `` I might be in any kind of walk of life , but when you were young , and especially if you were in , as I was , in rock 'n' roll bands in the 1970s , when everybody seemed to be very excited about everything , it was - there were quite a lot of opportunities for disaster to befall a lusty young man .
You know , climbing out of windows and along the - I mean , I remember climbing out of a hotel window , you know , to surprise someone who was in the room next door , you know , sort of five or six stories up . ''
