Shinedown open their fourth studio album with this rocker .
Drummer Barry Kerch told Alternative Addiction : `` It 's self-explanatory ; it 's about that fight and just going for it .
Pumping yourself up and strapping yourself in for the ride of your life . ''
The song 's music video was filmed during the 2013 Carnival Of Madness tour and was shot by Rob Fenn .
The clip features both video and photo stills taken during the concerts .
Shinedown frontman Brent Smith said that Fenn , `` was constantly filming , taking pictures , and documenting the reinvention of the tour . ''
`` We had such an amazing time seeing all of our fans out on the road , '' he added , `` that we thought : what better way to present the video for our fifth single off of Amaryllis than incorporating all the footage he captured ?
We hope the fans love it as much as we do . ''
This served as the official theme song to WWE 's professional wrestling pay-per-view event Extreme Rules 2012 , which took place on April 29 , 2012 at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont , Illinois .
