This acoustic ballad finds Eminem getting contemplative .
Florida producer and songwriter Jim Jonsin produced the track .
`` He was open to ideas , '' Jonsin told MTV News about working with Eminem .
`` He was real respectful to my craft .
He let me do what I do .
He asked me ideas on some of the lyrics .
We had ideas for lyric changes .
Certain words may or may not work on radio .
We talked about that .
He had a setup outside of the room to do production , but I 'd rather be in the room where he was at , and he was cool with that .
And I knocked out a couple of joints in there while he was in there with me .
He was pretty open and he let me do my thing .
He did his thing .
It was a pretty good experience . ''
In an interview with Billboard magazine , Jonsin said he went for a `` soulful , Southern rock feel '' for the beat and heard from Eminem 's music manager Paul Rosenberg shortly after sending the demo .
Within three days , Jonsin met Slim Shady in Detroit .
`` He had already done his vocals before I got there , so we just polished it up and tried out other song ideas , '' he said .
Jonsin originally recorded the track with British songwriter Steve McEwan .
`` Me and Steve McEwan actually wrote the song , we actually did it here in New York on guitar -- it was just a guitar vocal on an iPhone , '' the producer told MTV News .
`` We took the idea later in Miami , like three months after , and produced the track .
`` Jonsin 's manager suggested that he send the track to Eminem .
`` He had me strip down the verses , take them out , and make the track a little more hip-hop , and he sent it out , '' he said .
The song 's chorus acted as a guide for the Slim Shady to do his own thing .
`` The chorus was based off of a chase , a guy who 's chasing after a woman that he 's crazy about , '' Jonsin said of the theme .
`` He loves her ; she 's everything to him .
I 'm a rocket ship aiming at her heart , her heart 's the moon -- I 'm going full-on . ''
`` I did n't really believe that it would end up on Eminem 's album , let alone be a single , '' he added .
The song features an interpolation of `` Drive '' by R.E.M. .
The song 's music video was shot in Santa Clarita , California and features DJ and former porn star Sasha Grey as Eminem 's leading lady .
