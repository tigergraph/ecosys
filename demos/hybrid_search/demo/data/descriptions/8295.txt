This is a track from Tear The World Down , the debut album from Rock band We Are The Fallen .
The band comprises 2007 American Idol finalist contestant Carly Smithson , Marty O'Brien and former Evanescence members Ben Moody , John LeCompt , and Rocky Gray .
Smithson told People Magazine , `` I do n't play an instrument so I focus on melody and lyrics . ''
When asked to tell the story behind the song , she stopped short saying : `` All of our songs have personal meanings to us but we prefer to allow our listeners to have their own take on them .
It 's a more interesting way to listen to a song and connect to the lyrics . ''
