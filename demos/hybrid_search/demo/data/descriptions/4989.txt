This song begins with a dreamy six piece brass section led by trumpeter Derek Watkins , who played on the Beatles ' `` A Day In The Life '' and `` Strawberry Fields Forever . ''
The song then plunges into a cascade of thrashy guitar riffing .
Said guitarist Joshua Hayward to The Quietus : `` Having our own studio , I discovered the fact that you can play more than ten guitar tracks on a record .
And I was just experimenting . ''
Bass player Rhys Webb told NME : `` We wrote this on a Monday , which might explain its lazy introduction - I think the song got faster as the day went on and we shook the weekend blues away . ''
