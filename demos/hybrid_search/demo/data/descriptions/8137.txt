`` Wonderful World , '' or '' -LRB- What a -RRB- Wonderful World , '' was one of Sam Cooke 's 29 US Top 40 hits released between 1957 and 1964 .
The song was released on April 14 , 1960 and quickly reached # 2 on the US Black Singles chart , # 12 on the US Pop Singles chart , and # 27 on the UK Singles chart .
Cooke recorded `` Wonderful World '' on Keen Records shortly before he left the label over a royalty dispute in 1959 .
In 1960 , Cooke had moved on to RCA Victor , but Keen , still owning the rights to `` Wonderful World , '' released the single in April 1960 .
Throughout the years , `` Wonderful World '' has been covered by a number of artists including Otis Redding , Bryan Ferry , Michael Bolton , and Rod Stewart .
After Sam Cooke 's death in 1964 , there were a rash of `` tribute '' covers released including a 1965 up-tempo version by Herman 's Hermits , which reached # 4 on the US Pop Singles chart and # 7 on the UK Singles chart , and a rendition by The Supremes released on their 1965 album `` We Remember Sam Cooke . ''
In 1977 , Art Garfunkel put his spin on the hit for his album , Watermark , which featured harmonies by friend , James Taylor , and former partner , Paul Simon .
According to Rolling Stone , before the song came out , Cooke liked to sing it for women he met , telling them he 'd made it up on the spot just for them .
`` Wonderful World '' was originally written by music legends Lou Alder and Herb Alpert , but Cooke added the finishing lyrical touches , and the trio used the songwriting pseudonym `` Barbara Campbell , '' the name of Cooke 's high school sweetheart .
Adler went on from this success to found Dunhill Records and manage big name artists such as Jan & Dean , The Mamas & The Papas , and Carole King .
Not to be outdone , his writing partner , Herb Alpert , put the `` A '' in A&M Records after performing for several years with his band Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass .
Do n't let the bouncy rhythm and upbeat tempo fool you .
According to Craig Werner , a professor of African American Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , the song may have a more politically charged meaning .
In his book , A Change Is Gon na Come : Music , Race and the Soul of America , Werner writes that `` Wonderful World '' may be one of the first examples of Cooke 's crossover into politics , where he informs white listeners that he `` do n't know much about history '' and `` do n't know much biology '' as a comment that these are the things to forget about African-Americans , and all they need to remember is love .
`` Wonderful World '' has been a hit with filmmakers since its release .
The song can be heard in the famous lunchroom scene of the 1978 classic , Animal House .
It was also featured in the 1983 Richard Gere drama , Breathless , and appeared in the opening titles of the 2005 Will Smith comedy , Hitch .
A Greg Chapman cover of `` Wonderful World '' was spotlighted in the 1985 film , Witness , which spurred resurgence in popularity for the single and led to use of the Cooke original in a well-remembered 1986 British ad for Levi 501 Jeans .
The song originally peaked at # 27 in the UK , but after the commercial , the song was re-released there and reached # 2 .
