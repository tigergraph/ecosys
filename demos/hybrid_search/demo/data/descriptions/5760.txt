Lead singer Adam Lazzara mentioned on his Formspring account that this was his favorite song from past albums that he had written .
It is speculated that the song is about his former alcohol/drug abuse that got particularly bad while he was staying in Miami .
The lyrics , `` You have to , you just have to trust me , who ever I was then I could never be again '' refer to how he has since recovered and changed as a person .
