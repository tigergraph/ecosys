Debi Nova is a Costa Rican female vocalist who has worked with a number of artists including Ricky Martin , Q-Tip , Sergio Mendes and Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas .
This Soca/Hip-Hop-inspired tune is the first single from her debut solo album , Luna Nueva .
The album 's title is Spanish for `` new moon , '' and speaks to Nova 's artistic growth .
She told MTV News that it has nothing to do with the popular 2009 Twilight movie , New Moon .
`` No , it 's not about the vampires , '' she said .
`` When I decided to make this album in 2007 , it was like a new cycle beginning for me , it was like a rebirth .
The new moon in many different cultures marks the beginning of a cycle , and I wanted to mark the beginning of a cycle . ''
Nova recorded in both Spanish and English on Luna Nueva .
She told MTV News that she did n't set out to create a bilingual album , but rather , it evolved organically .
`` I did n't plan it , '' she said .
`` You know , I really went into the studio with a blank canvas ; I had no idea what I was going to do .
I speak both languages , so I just let inspiration come in whatever shape , form it wanted to come , and sometimes it came in English , sometimes it came in Spanish , sometimes it came in both .
So halfway through the album it was a deliberate thing .
I wanted to make an album that represented that . ''
