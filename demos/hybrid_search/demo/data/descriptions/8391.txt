This song is loosely based on the Brothers Grimm fable , The Robber Bridegroom .
The song is actually about a cannibal who is having this internal struggle about eating the woman that he loves .
The line , `` Something in this empty room is telling me that I should run '' is most likely making a reference to the bird or old woman in the original story .
