On this musically stripped-down cut , Allan opens up to moving forward since the tragic suicide of his wife Angela in 2004 , while admitting , `` I still miss her every day . ''
He told Country Weekly : `` She always wanted me to write songs about her , but I never did back then .
Now , I write all sorts of songs about her . ''
Allan still plays this at some of his concerts .
He told American Songwriter magazine in 2013 : `` In hindsight , you know , there is so much guilt that comes along with suicide , and when I play that song , I think , `` I did it all right .
I loved her and it was all good .
And I have no regrets . ' ''
Allan penned this song with Jon Randall and Jaime Hanna .
He recalled to The Boot : `` Writing it , I can distinctly remember Jon Randall and Jaime Hanna - we had three hooks that we were kicking around .
It was more of just ` Are you willing to go there ?
, ' and I said , ` Yeah . '
And we were able to get a real heartfelt , honest song out of it .
That 's where the best ones come from .
It 's just whether you feel like crying , whether you feel like going down that path .
Yeah , I like that song , ` No Regrets . '
I sleep well at night . ''
