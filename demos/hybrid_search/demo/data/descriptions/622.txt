This cool mid-tempo tune marks lead guitarist Tommy Thayer 's Kiss vocal debut .
Thayer originally played Ace Frehley in a Kiss tribute band called Cold Gin , who once played at Kiss rhythm guitarist Paul Stanley 's birthday party .
Co-founder Gene Simmons then offered Thayer a job as his assistant and when Ace Frehley left Kiss in 2002 , Thayer was the band 's choice to replace him .
