This song finds Zedd hooking up with OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder .
Zedd told Digital Spy their collaboration was n't planned .
He explained : `` He wrote this topline a year ago and I loved it , so he gave it to me to work on in my own time .
A few months later when I was working on a different song I realized his topline fit perfectly on it , so we went with it .
It was n't planned for the mainstream , it just happened naturally . ''
