Thousand Foot Krutch singer Trevor McNevan -LRB- from NewReleaseTuesday -RRB- : `` This is a very intimate song .
It 's a love song , and my way of saying , ' I ca n't get enough of you . '
It 's a worship song to me .
There 's not a day in my life when I do n't need God more and want to get closer . ''
