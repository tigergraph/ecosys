Having composed a ` punk orchestra ' score for The Dark Knight , Hans Zimmer told NME that he went all over the place for third part of Christopher Nolan 's Batman trilogy , The Dark Knight Rises .
He told NME : `` I suppose Can was an influence , and in a weird way Goldfrapp , and Bach .
It 's got much more of a rock 'n' roll spine than film music normally does .
People say ` minimalism ' but it is n't really - there are all these huge gestures .
Bane just crashes into that world and it gave me a huge opportunity to do something completely reckless.I went to Warner Brothers , '' he continued , `` they were very nice about it - and said ' I have this idea - can I get a huge orchestra and try this thing out ... and if it does n't work will you be so kind as to not mention that I just blew half the music budget . ''
The Dark Knight Rises debuted at # 8 on the Billboard 200 , the highest-arriving score album in just over 10 years .
The previous one to start off higher was John Williams ' Star Wars Episode II : Attack of the Clones , which bowed at # 6 on the chart dated May 11 , 2002 .
