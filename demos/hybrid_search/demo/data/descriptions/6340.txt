According to an interview with vocalist Biff Byford and guitarist Paul Quinn in the launch issue of Kerrang !
, June 1981 , this track was inspired by the previous year 's Monsters Of Rock festival at Castle Donnington , something which is fairly evident from the lyric .
Byford added the song was `` originally a lot longer - there were three other verses , one about us , one about the American bands and one about Judas Priest .
But we kicked them out and chopped it down a bit '' .
The song also mentions Rainbow - the headliners - `` See the rainbow shining brightly '' .
The Donnington festival was initiated in 1980 .
On August 16 , Saxon joined Rainbow and five other bands - Judas Priest -LRB- who like Saxon emanate from Yorkshire -RRB- , the German band Scorpions , April Wine from Canada , and two bands from New York City - Riot and Touch .
The opening solo of `` And The Bands Played On '' is not dissimilar from `` 747 -LRB- Strangers In The Night -RRB- '' , and actually includes the phrase `` strangers in the night '' in the lyrics .
The group composition was released as a single on the Capital label .
Running to 2 minutes 48 seconds , it was produced by Nigel Thomas , and backed by two songs : `` Hungry Years '' and `` Heavy Metal Thunder '' .
