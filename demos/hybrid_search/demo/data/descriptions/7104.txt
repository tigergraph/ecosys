Silverstein frontman Shane Told explained the song 's meaning to Alternative Press magazine : `` This song is taking a shot at the `` rivalry '' so many bands out there seem to have with each other .
I find it annoying and childish when bands think they deserve more than another band , or are ` bigger ' or whatever .
During the last 11 years , I 've seen it all : bands come from nothing and turn into millionaires and lose it all just as fast .
This song is about that , and about the greed so many artists have . ''
