According to frontman Rivers Cuomo , this is an Anti-Drug song .
-LRB- thanks , Chris - Andover , MN -RRB- MTV played an edited version called `` We Are All In Love . ''
In 2001 , MTV asked Weezer to re-record their song `` Hash Pipe '' as `` Half Pipe , '' but the band refused -LRB- MTV played it , but obscured the title -RRB- .
This time , the band gave MTV the edit , which may serve to make a point about the absurdity of their broadcast standards .
Cuomo : `` I was living in an apartment above the Sunset Strip , and every Friday and Saturday night I 'd hear people cruising and partying , and hooting and hollering .
And I went to sleep one night and I heard those sounds all through the night , in my dreams .
I had this dream about a kid on the Metro bus , blasting hip hop into his brain through his headphones .
And the music sounded so decadent and over stimulating , and I woke up in the midst of that dream , in a haze , and immediately said to myself , ` Man , we 're all on drugs ! '
And I instantly knew that would be a cool song . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- There are 2 videos for this song .
The first one was a re-edit of Grim Reaper 's `` Fear No Evil '' video from 1985 .
This was sent to international markets before the band had a chance to film a video .
The version with Rivers Cuomo wandering around the strange town is the final version , but they are both `` official . ''
