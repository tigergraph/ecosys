This is about nuclear holocaust seen from a fetus ' perspective .
He is still inside the mother 's womb and he knows the bomb has exploded and he is going to die because he can not help breathing in the radioactive air through his mother .
We witness helplessly as he and the rest of mankind run out of air and die .
