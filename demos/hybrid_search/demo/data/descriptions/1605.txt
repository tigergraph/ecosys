Janet Jackson on her record label 's website : `` It was written and produced by Jermaine -LRB- Jermaine Dupri her boyfriend and head of urban music at Island -RRB- .
When I read the lyrics by Jermaine and Johnta Austin , I could n't help but cry .
The more I thought about the story , the more I saw how it reveals another aspect of positive discipline , especially as it relates to relationships .
The song says that we ca n't stop trying just because we hit rough times .
It 's not too late ; we ca n't give up on our fate ; we ca n't let go of that discipline that allows us to work through problems and find a way to the wonders that come with open and honest love . ''
