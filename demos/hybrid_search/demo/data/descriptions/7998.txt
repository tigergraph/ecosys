This song was remixed for its single release to sound less Country and to appeal more to Pop audiences in the hopes of giving Twain a mainstream crossover hit .
The plan worked as it became her first Top Ten hit in both the UK and US and reaching # 1 in Australia .
The song was Twain 's most successful single release on the Billboard Hot 100 spending a record 9 weeks at # 2 -LRB- non-consecutive weeks -RRB- .
The song won the 1998 Grammy Awards for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and Best Country Song .
The album Come On Over spent a record 50 weeks at # 1 on Billboard country album charts , selling 22 million in the USA and in total worldwide over 39 million .
It is at the time of writing the best selling album by a female solo artist in the US and the biggest selling country LP in both the UK and US .
Shania Twain wrote this song with her rock producer husband , Robert `` Mutt '' Lange .
Her lyrics were inspired by their marriage , which many felt would n't last .
The soothsayers were right as Twain and Lange divorced ten years later in 2008 after fourteen years of marriage .
The original Orleans song reached # 5 in the US charts in 1976 .
