Brown explained to Clash Magazine that he originally recorded this for a Japanese compilation album that he did in 2008 , which `` a friend of mine helped put together and it was all electronic and ... it worked a bit but I wanted to do it with like live drums and live players .
So I re-did it . ''
Brown told Clash Magazine about the song 's lyrical content : `` It 's the basic sentiment that we 're all unique , I wanted to express that like , I do n't know just cause I 'm some kind of pop star does n't mean I 'm not the same as my mate whose a scaffolder , y' know what I mean ?
We both have to take the rough with the smooth you know .
Everything 's out of our power and out of our control , we have to keep a smile on our face , when it rains every day .
No matter what position you are in life , we 're basically all the same , we all require the same things , we all dream the same dreams probably . ''
