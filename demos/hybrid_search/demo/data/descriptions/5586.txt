This is Lauren 's sole writing credit on her debut album , Wildflower .
She told the story of the song to Taste of Country : `` I wrote this song with Brett James and Luke Laird .
We had a great connection and I 'm really fortunate that I got to write with them .
We sat down and I talked about how every time I like a boy , he does n't like me .
Then when I do n't like him anymore , all he is doing is blowing up my cell phone and calling me all the time and driving me nuts .
I 'm thinking , ` You did n't like me when I liked you . '
In love , sometimes the timing is never right , and that is basically what the songs says .
It talks about how love confuses you and makes you all crazy inside .
I love it . ''
Lauren told Billboard magazine how this song came about : `` We actually wrote another song first and then we just started randomly jamming and came up with the music , then I started spitting out words for it , '' she said .
`` We put together a chorus and then I called them four or five days later and we -LSB- finished -RSB- the song . ''
Though Lauren claims only one writing credit , she told USA Today her debut album is an accurate representation of her personality and life experiences .
`` They have different feels a little bit , but they 're all me , '' she said .
`` If the story in the songs did n't happen to me personally , they remind me of something that has happened to someone I know or someone in my family . ''
