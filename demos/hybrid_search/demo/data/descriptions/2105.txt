This is the first single from Detox , the third studio album by American hip hop artist Dr. Dre .
The song features rapper Snoop Dogg and R&B singer Akon and was leaked onto the internet on November 16 , 2010 .
The song was Dre 's first solo song in nine years his previous release being `` Bad Intentions '' in November 2001 .
Dre reluctantly agreed to release this as a single after it leaked into the internet .
He told American radio host Big Boy that he was unhappy about the release of the song as it had n't completed it and he did n't think the track was a fair reflection of the album as a whole .
Said Dre : `` It 's a little bit unfortunate with the technology today .
-LRB- Kush -RRB- got leaked and it was a version of it that I really was n't happy about , -LRB- but -RRB- we 're going to go ahead and push it and put it out because everybody seems to like itI just thought the content , it 's about weed smoking , and I do n't want people to think that that 's what my album is about .
This is actually the only song with that type of content . ''
Snoop said about the collaboration : `` Dr Dre , that 's my big homeboy , that 's my big brother .
He gave me my start .
so whenever he calls me to come through and do what I need to I 'm there for him .
Akon 's part of the family too so this is what we do , we just make great music . ''
The song 's subject matter is smoking marijuana .
`` Now that puff puff pass sh-t '' declares Dre before Akon sings the chorus and Snoop Dogg spits in his verse , `` Kush 'til my mind gone . ''
Kush is a family of potent cannabis strains named for its origins in Hindu Kush , a mountain range in Afghanistan .
The Joseph Kahn-directed video was shot November 18 , 2010 in Downtown LA. 50 Cent , E-40 , Roccett , The Menace and Glasses Malone all make cameo apearences in the clip , along with featured artists Snoop Dogg and Akon .
