This is the opening track from American alternative rock band Madina Lake 's third studio album , World War III .
The record is the last installment of their concept trilogy , and concludes the Leone twins ' tales of a metaphorical universe with the rediscovery of Adalia and an epic battle of good and evil .
Frontman Nathan Leone told Rock Sound magazine : `` In a lot of ways I feel like World War III has written itself .
Our life circumstances at the time were such that all we really had to or were even capable of doing was letting it out .
Over thinking it or contriving sentiments was n't an option yet neither was holding anything back .
Hence it 's lyrical content is blunt and could n't be more honest . ''
Nathan told the story of the song to Rock Sound magazine : `` When Mateo -LSB- Camargo , guitar -RSB- played me the riff for ` Howdy ... ' I knew immediately what it was going to be about .
He had only sent that riff so when the band got to it we started our typical Madina structure/arrangements , however Mateo canned it and convinced us to just develop the song instrumentally instead of adding chord changes , arrangement developing and changing parts .
This way each of us had to use our respective parts to give the dynamic and it turned out way cooler -LRB- imho -RRB- .
Matthew -LSB- Leone , bassist -RSB- added these percussive bass stabs which defined the song to me .
Dan -LSB- Torelli , drums -RSB- was able to play his ass without all his parts getting chopped down to straight beats/no fills and vocally we left all kinds of cracks and imperfections , leaving the song as raw and real as it 's subject matter . ''
