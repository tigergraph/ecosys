This song confronts the issue of death head on .
The Sun June 5 , 2009 suggested to Iggy that he 's singing about something most people shy away from .
He replied laughing : `` Especially Americans !
If you mention it to a lot of Americans , they start laughing .
They 're embarrassed for you . ''
The album title Préliminaires translates as `` Foreplay . ''
The Sun asked Iggy why he titled it such .
`` The record company , the marketing genie wanted to call it Hors D'oeuvres , '' he replied , holding up his hands in horror .
`` I was thinking more of a title track like Spanish Coast . ''
Iggy decided on Préliminaires .
He explained : `` This is a slim volume , not a huge bite but a step in a certain direction .
So I thought the name fits and there 's the fun side .
Also , once I hit 50 , it began to occur to me that there was going to be some sort of a death thing coming up for me .
I 'm 62 now , so I thought about ` preliminary ' to death . ''
