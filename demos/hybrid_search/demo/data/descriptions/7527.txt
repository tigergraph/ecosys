Like many of the tracks on Beach House 's fourth album , Bloom , this song is about the elusiveness of certain feelings .
Guitarist Alex Scally commented to About.com : `` I think elusiveness is a big feeling in everyone 's life .
Ideally we want a song to be an honest reflection of reality .
You know , you look at it , you gaze into it , and what 's given back to you carries with it a truth ; it 's something real , something very real .
That 's what we want , more than anything .
What exactly you see , in your own mind , is your own experience of that truth .
`` This was the first song to be released from Bloom .
