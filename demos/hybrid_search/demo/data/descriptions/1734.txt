This celebration of commitment was written by Mark D. Sanders , Steven Dale Jones and Ed Hill .
Ingram explained to AOL what attracted him to this tune : `` What is connecting with people when they hear this song is the same thing that I gravitated to .
The song addresses something important .
It 's about standing up and being accountable .
These days , that does n't happen all the time - whether you are talking business , politics , or family .
I do n't want to get too preachy , but when you have a song that is a damn good example of how to handle the trials and challenges in life , it connects . ''
Ingram explained to CMT News : `` There 's three verses in the single .
The first verse is about a 19-year-old , second verse is about two marines who go off to war and only one returns and the third is a farmer living off the land where his family has lived for a century .
Repeat the chorus after each verse with ` that 's a man . ' ''
