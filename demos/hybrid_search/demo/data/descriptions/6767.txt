This is one of three songwriting contributions by vocalist Dave Gahan to Sounds of the Universe .
Since Vince Clarke left the band in the early 1980s principal songwriter Martin Gore has penned most of Depeche Mode 's songs , but on Sounds of the Universe , he allowed Gahan more scope .
The band 's manager , Jonathan Kessler commented to Billboard magazine : `` I think Dave 's songwriting is giving him the feeling of being a part of more , and more secure .
There 's definitely a maturity , like , ` Hey , we 've done this enough .
It 's better that all of us get along than not . ' ''
This song is closest to a full out rocker on the album .
Gahan explained in publicity materials : `` I wanted to take it away from being a straight , with a feel beneath it that was kind of My Bloody Valentine or Jesus and Mary Chain .
A big lush sound with this droning wall of noise underneath .
Martin did some fantastic backing vocals for that . ''
