This track finds Lamar telling the story of a break into a neighbor 's house as he confesses how his character would change when he was around his homies .
`` It 's about being a teenager from L.A. and being influenced by your peers and who you 're hanging out with , '' he told Complex magazine . ''
-LSB- I overcame peer pressure in my life because -RSB- I had a father in my life , '' continued Lamar .
That 's a big part of my life .
I had respect for him .
He was n't right there , he could n't be there all the time , and he was n't no perfect person .
But at the same time , he had much love for me .
He made sure I had a better life .
He made sure I found that life through music . ''
Tabu 's smooth to sinister production samples the Danish Hip-Hop group Suspekt 's 2011 track , `` Helt Alene . ''
