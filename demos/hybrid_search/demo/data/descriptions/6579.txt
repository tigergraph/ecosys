This song is about a couple .
The man turns into a werewolf and tries to keep it a secret from his love .
One night his love finds him in a barn and sees him change into his werewolf form .
He quickly runs into the cornfield and she chases after him .
While the sun is beginning to rise - he is still a werewolf at this point - she finds him and as an animal who can not control himself he kills her before he changes back .
All she wanted was to find him so she could tell him that she is okay with his curse and she will still love him .
