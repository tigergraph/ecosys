Guitarist Benji Madden discussed this song in a track to track interview with Alternative Press : `` Probably the most straightforward rock song on Cardiology , ` Alive ' is a little bit of a new sound for us .
On every record , we like to open a new door that we can continue to grow from in the future .
This is a song about the realization of true love . ''
