The working title for this song was `` Chuck '' as Chester French got the vibe for this song from 1960s R&B vocalist Chuck Jackson .
Instrumentalist Maxwell Drummey recalled to Complex Magazine : `` I was at the studio for like two or three days with that song and I remember getting breakfast at 10 and saw my friends and asked them to come check it out and make sure it did n't suck . ''
