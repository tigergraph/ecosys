This Carson Chamberlain , Clint Daniels and Jeff Hyde penned song has a universal message of loss .
Corbin said : `` When I heard the melody , I thought , ` that 's a hit . '
The song can mean different things for different people .
She could have died , she could have left him -- people can interpret it the way they feel . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Shaun Silva and tells the storyline backwards , starting with the woman in the car , and finally making her way to the bedroom .
It could be argued that it brings the story to a close , but Easton does n't agree .
`` I think it 's still open ended , '' he told The Boot .
`` She could have been leaving the guy or she could have been just going to work and got run over by a truck .
Anything can happen . ''
The song was released as Corbin 's third single .
Easton was asked by The Boot what drew him to this ballad , when its a few paces off from his first two singles ?
`` I 've always loved sad songs , '' the singer explained .
`` For me , that 's what Country music is all about .
I did n't make it a point to make this a different direction .
This song just happened to be .
It 's the only ballad on the record , and I love the song . ''
