This is the title track of British alternative rock band British Sea Power 's fourth EP .
Frontman Scott Wilkinson told Q magazine about this thundering stomper with lyrical references to TV chef Rick Stein .
`` It 's about a transit van called Zeus with magical powers .
I got a bit sick of a party at Rick Stein 's house and Zeus is the means of escape . ''
`` It 's not a real life story , '' he added , `` it 's fantasy .
I just woke up and for some reason I had the image of meeting Rick Stein in my head . ''
