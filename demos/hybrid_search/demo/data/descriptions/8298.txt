The Big Pink close their second album , Future This , with this ode to a lost friend .
The most personal song on the record , it was at least part inspired by the death of Tarka , the brother of The Big Pink 's Milo Cordell , who hung himself in 2008 .
In the past Cordell has let his Big Pink partner Robbie Furze take on any vocal duties .
However , he steps up to the mic on this song to read from the opening paragraph of Italian-American author John Fante 's 1939 novel , Ask The Dust , which is set during the Great Depression-era in Los Angeles .
Cordell explained to Spin magazine : `` That book just means a lot to me and was given to me by someone I love very much .
It just seemed to be apt for that part .
It has to do with 77 different ways to say goodbye , which is how the chorus goes . ''
