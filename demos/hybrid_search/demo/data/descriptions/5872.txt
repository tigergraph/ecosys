`` Deeper and Deeper '' was written by the band and recorded during the sessions for their album Phantoms .
It was used on the soundtrack of the 1984 movie Streets of Fire , and it plays under the end credits .
Along with the other Fixx songs of the era , it was produced by Rupert Hine , who considers it one of his personal Fixx favorites .
Said Hine : `` It is regrettable that it was part of a terrible movie 's soundtrack and not part of the Phantoms album for which it was recorded .
Even worse , I was very much part of that decision process .
It became the ` most-played Alternative rock track ' of that year , but was not able to promote the great album it would have otherwise been a part of . ''
Rupert Hine created the distinctive keyboard part at the beginning of the song by triggering a keyboard from a pulse created by a Linn drum .
It was the triggering that made the unusual effect .
The long version of the song , which is the original , runs 6:30 and appears as the B-side of the `` Are We Ourselves ? ''
single .
