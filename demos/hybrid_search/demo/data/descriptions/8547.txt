This is the first single from Scottish singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald 's second album , A Curious Thing .
The song has a more upbeat , rocky sound than anything on Macdonald 's debut album .
She told The Daily Record January 12 , 2010 : `` This particular song is a lot rockier .
The whole album is .
It 's a mix of everything .
I 've written every song on my acoustic guitar and when I wrote it , it did n't sound like this , but then when you go into the studio things just kind of jump out at you and we thought it sounded really cool with all the guitars and stuff . ''
Macdonald explained this song 's meaning to Contactmusic.com : `` As with all of the songs I have tried to come up with a meaning for it , but the way I look at it now is that it 's a song about dong something because you want to , and not because you think you have to .
The example I use is the global warming issue .
I think it 's really important issue , but I also think that people should do something about it because they want to and they feel passionate , not because the government say you must stop driving or you must stop flying .
I do n't think that works . ''
Macdonald explained the album title to The Daily Record : `` I was just sitting going through all the new songs and really listening intently to the lyrics and that 's a line from one of the songs that I thought sounded quite nice as an album title . ''
Macdonald told Spinner UK that an inspiration for this song was an unnamed , well-known pop star preaching to a crowd at a European awards show .
`` It 's not Kanye West or Bono ! ''
she said .
