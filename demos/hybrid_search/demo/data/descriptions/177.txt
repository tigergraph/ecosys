Glasvegas frontman James Allan penned this tear-jerker one day during a long walk in Santa Monica .
He explained to the Sunday Mail : `` A friend of mine said in an email , ' I miss you lots sometimes ' and although the song is not about her , the words were the inspiration behind it .
It was a bit of a tall order to put the parts down for the song and create a bit of order out of it . ''
