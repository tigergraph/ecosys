Bragg told The Independent On Sunday that the lyrics were inspired by the everyday frustrations of his relationship with his long-term partner , Juliet .
`` We 've had a great time , '' he said , `` and we have a lovely son , Jack , who 's 19 , and who 's been lucky enough to have had a lovely childhood .
But , you know , we have our days when we crack our heads , when I do n't live up to her expectations of me and when she does n't live up to my expectations of her .
And this causes domestic friction .
But the struggle in a relationship is where the sparks are , and I 'm writing about things that frustrate me .
`` Bragg added that , lyrically he took certain artistic license .
`` I 've never left home like my character in ` Swallow My Pride ' has , '' he said , `` but have I gone a few days without speaking -LSB- to her -RSB- I most certainly have .
And have I been on tour and not phoned because I 'm pissed off ?
Yes I have .
If I were to suggest otherwise , my son would call me out as a liar . ''
