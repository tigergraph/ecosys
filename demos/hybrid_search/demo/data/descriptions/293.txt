Spektor is notoriously reluctant to discuss the meanings of her songs .
When Spin magazine asked her what this song is about , she replied : `` Well , that 's really hard for me .
I do n't really think of songs in those terms .
I do n't sit down with an agenda and go , `` I 'm going to write a song about ... '' you know ?
I just start playing a little bit on the piano , and then I start singing a little bit , and then it 's over - and there 's a song .
Sometimes , very rarely , I can trace the ancestry of a lyric , and I 'll be like , `` Oh , it 's a combination of that person I saw in the street and that one painting I saw in a museum , and that one movie I saw , '' or something like that .
But for the most part , it 's not really clear even to me .
People think that if you ca n't explain a linear meaning , then the song 's meaningless , or that you just put words together because they sound nice .
But it 's not that either .
It feels completely meaningful - it all means very exact stuff .
I even feel like it 's super important to use `` a '' instead of `` the '' in some songs , you know ?
I 'll be moving tiny little things around in my mouth , and then I 'll get them just right and it sort of freezes - and that 's fate . ''
Spektor told Entertainment Weekly that she really enjoyed working with Lynne .
She said : `` He 's amazing , in every way .
He plays everything and anything .
He 's just like , ` Oh , we need drums on this , I 'll play .
Oh , we need guitar .
Oh , we need 12-string , or banjo . '
He can just pick anything up and play it .
And he sings .
It was really fun to get to sing with him .
We sing harmonies on `` Genius Next Door '' and on `` Blue Lips . ''
Certain things he did , I would never have thought to do , like the way the piano fades up on `` Blue Lips . ''
I love things like that because they would have never entered my mind .
That 's the exciting thing about working with producers , because you get to work with ideas that would have never popped into your head . ''
Jeff Lynne -LRB- ELO , The Traveling Wilburys -RRB- produced this song .
The British musician/producer also helmed `` Genius Next Door , '' `` Folding Chair '' and `` Wallet '' on Far .
Despite The Washington Post naming him the fourth greatest record producer in history in 2008 , Spektor admitted to BBc News that she had very little idea about her collaborator ' pedigree before she went into the studio .
She admitted : `` I memorised his name off a Tom Petty record that I really liked called Highway Companion because I just loved how it sounded .
It was only later that I found out he 'd done all this other stuff . ''
