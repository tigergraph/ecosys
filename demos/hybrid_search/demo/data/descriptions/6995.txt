Johnson : `` I was up real late one night , picked up the guitar .
I was just playing real quietly and trying not to wake anyone up .
It 's about when you 're having trouble sleeping just because there 's too much on your mind .
I just could n't go to bed .
So I picked up the guitar and wrote that song all in one night .
It 's basically about it being impossible to find resolve .
Sometimes you want to resolve these thoughts in your head .
And for me at least , it 's best just to go to sleep sometimes .
You wake up in the morning and everything seems better even though your whole world seems like it was dark and in a bad place the night before .
It 's probably my favorite song on the record .
We might 've done two or three takes on that one , but we used the first take because it had a real natural feel to it . ''
