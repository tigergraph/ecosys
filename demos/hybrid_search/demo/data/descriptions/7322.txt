This is the title track from New York-bred singer and songwriter Matthew Koma 's debut EP , released by Cherrytree/Darkchild/Interscope Records on May 29,2012 .
Koma wrote and produced/co-produced all of the four tracks on the record .
Regarding the meaning of the song 's music promo , Koma said : `` The video takes place inside of a girl 's mind / psyche .
We worked on a bunch of different projections / images that play off the lyric and interact with her .
She 's being challenged by all of these thoughts and ideas pushing her to take a chance on faith and love .
I always thought it would be interesting to see someone physically go through their own headspace and what it could look like .
Naturally , I 'm nonchalantly performing in her head . ''
Those of you who keep up with celeb gossip will have read that Call Me Maybe singer Carly Rae Jepson has definitely been calling Matthew Koma as they were dating at the time of this song 's release .
Koma also co-penned several tracks on his girlfriend 's Kiss album , including the single , `` This Kiss . ''
Whilst we 're on the subject of parachutes , did you know Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin made the first parachute jump from a balloon above Paris in 1797 ?
He was dropped from about 6,500 ft. over Monceau Park in a 23-ft .
- diameter parachute made of white canvas with a basket attached and was airsick on the way down as the contraption lacked the hole in the top to steady it .
