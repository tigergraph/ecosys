A track from the Punk band X 's debut album , this song got the most attention , as it was about a lurid combination of sex and drugs .
Explaining how the song was often misinterpreted by the slam dancing throngs at their early shows around Los Angeles , X guitarist John Doe told BAM in 1980 : '' ` Johnny Hit and Run Paulene ' is about a guy who takes an imaginary drug that allows him to have sex once an hour for 24 hours .
It 's about rape , forcible intercourse and s -- t like that .
I see people getting into it like , ` Yeah , hit and run ... ' I 'm saying this happens a lot , watch out for it , be aware , do n't give in to it .
Do n't think I 'm condoning rape ! ''
In the book MTV Ruled the World - The Early Years of Music Video , John Doe reminisces on the early '80s punk scene : `` There 's a lot of revisionist history about punk rock .
People wanted to have impact and wanted to make a living and be an artist .
If I were to sum it up , I 'd say the music industry was pretty naive at that point .
There were so many fewer bands , so many fewer media outlets .
It 's like the reverse of now .
`` In the same book , he also admits sheepishly to a bit of irony regarding MTV : `` We were part of a pretty independent bunch of bands and felt that MTV was just part of the corporate mess .
I do n't think any of the members of X had a whole lot of respect for it .
For better or for worse , saying `` This is a bunch of bulls *** .
This is part of ` the man . '
Meanwhile , two years later , we signed with Elektra , which is part of ` the man . ' ''
