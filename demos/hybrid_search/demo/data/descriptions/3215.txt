Lead singer Julian Casablancas -LRB- from the NME -RRB- : `` It 's a sound that I usually hate , but when they were doing the background vocals on the chorus , I was trying to get -LRB- engineer/producer -RRB- Gus -LRB- Oberg -RRB- to get that , like , Boston chorus sound . ''
The song title evokes The Replacements ' leader Paul Westerberg 's 1999 solo album Suicaine Gratifaction .
