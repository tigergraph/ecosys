Following his role of the hard-luck Country singer Bad Blake in Crazy Heart , actor Jeff Bridges did it for real by recording his debut major label album .
It was produced by the actor 's buddy T-Bone Burnett , who 'd helmed the Crazy Heart soundtrack .
As part of his preparation for performing the music live , Bridges hooked up with his band of local pals , The Abiders , at the Troubadour in West Hollywood , California , where he told stories about the creation of some of the tracks .
Said Bridges : `` Part of the fun of making the album was revisiting my older tunes that have n't been fully realized .
` Slow Boat ' was a song I wrote with T-Bone for Crazy Heart . ''
He added : `` It certainly seemed like the right time to get into my music .
Crazy Heart really set fire to my music , working with old buddies .
It was the right season for it . ''
