Frontman Alex Kapranos told Uncut magazine February 2008 that this song , `` started out an acoustic song about a girl I kissed many years ago . ''
This song mirrors another track on the Franz Ferdinand : Tonight album `` No You Girls . ''
Kapronos explained to Rolling Stone that the two play `` on the idea of how we choose to remember events in our life - so one version is the memory and the other is the way it actually happened .
`` Kapronos told self-titled magazine that on this song , it `` is how you would remember the same event if you were recalling it honestly and remembering the awkwardness and how it maybe was n't as satisfying as you 'd hoped . ''
This song uses a human skeleton for percussion , which had been bought by Kapranos and guitarist Nick McCarthy from a Glasgow auction as part of an antique skeleton set recovered from a dead doctor 's office .
Kapranos explained to MTV News : `` I remember we were working on a song called ` Kiss Me , ' and we wanted to have a real dry , percussive sound in the chorus .
And we had this skeleton in a box that just ended up sitting in the corner of the studio , and we all sort of looked at it , and decided to experiment with it .
Nick had the hands and was clapping the bones together .
-LSB- Drummer -RSB- Paul -LSB- Thomson -RSB- was working with the pelvis bone and a femur .
We put the teeth in a glass jar and rattled that about .
We smacked the ribs together and we got this really weird , f -- ed-up kind of a sound that was wicked .
I ca n't think of any records with human bones on it . ''
The Tonight : Franz Ferdinand album describes a night out on the town .
Kapronos explained to the New Musical Express January 17,2009 that on this song : `` Evening 's over .
Dawn 's ripping through the curtains .
You kind of wish everything would be normal again .
This is the sort of song I 'd play to soothe myself at a time like that . ''
