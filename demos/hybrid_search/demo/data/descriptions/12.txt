The lyrics from this song were taken from the Dr. Seuss book Yertle The Turle .
-LRB- thanks , Mischa - Winnipeg , Canada -RRB- In lead singer Anthony Kiedis ' autobiography Scar Tissue , we learn that the opening line , `` Look at that turtle go , bro '' is said by producer George Clinton 's personal cocaine dealer .
The reason why is because George was behind on payments , and the dealer came in during the Freaky Styley sessions with a couple of other guys ready to physically harm Clinton .
Clinton knew his dealer was fascinated with the music industry , so he promised him a spot on the album as exchange for pay .
Anthony Kiedis was not too thrilled about this , but was ensured that it would not be very noticeable .
Kiedis referred to it as a cheap way of getting 15 minutes of fame .
