Mark Owen appeared on the March 11 , 2010 cover of The Sun in a story that salaciously detailed his infidelities .
He was given 24 hours beforehand to warn his wife Emma that the story would be running .
Owen explained to Q magazine why he included this self-penned song on the record : `` Even now part of me is going , Maybe it does n't have to be on there .
It 's a song that 's always going to be related to a time in my life that was very difficult .
But there 's another part of me that goes , It 's something that I can move on from after that track .
I spoke to Emma about it .
`` The Q interviewer asked how she reacted .
Owen replied : `` Different ways , really .
The thing is , the song was written before ... everything came about .
It was written as an optimistic song and then when everything happened it took on a different connotation .
I have to keep reminding myself that it was written looking ahead at a future together .
There 's mixed feelings in my stomach and stuff about it .
Do I need to put myself through that ?
But then it 's good to confront things and be open .
My hope for me , and my relationship with Emma , is in that song .
I do want us to grow old together .
I do fancy her .
Those feelings are there .
But it 's difficult because of what it brings up . ''
