Kellie Pickler explained the story behind this song on her MySpace page : `` I believe in this song because it beholds a very powerful message .
I think we all suffer from low self esteem from time to time and we all have our own insecurities , which can really bring a person down .
In today 's society we -LRB- including myself -RRB- often compare ourself to that person or model on the front of the magazine , and we all want those expensive clothes that are displayed .
I think that is just human nature .
I will be the first to tell you ` ALL OF THAT IS NOT REAL . '
You would NOT believe the touching up photographers can do to pictures .
By the time they are done airbrushing those pictures and touching them up , the photo barely looks like the person .
Photographers can make you thinner/heavier , give you whatever eye color you want , enhance and change anything in the photo .
We live in a very superficial world .
ALL of that stuff does NOT matter !
It is NOT important ! ''
