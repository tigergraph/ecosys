This banjo-led slow burner serves as both an apology to a former lover and a love letter to the people Mumford & Sons left behind while touring the world following the success of their debut album Sigh No More .
Holland Road is a real street in West London .
The band started their career playing in West London and were part of the `` West London folk scene . ''
Several years before frontman Marcus Mumford married British actress Carey Mulligan , he dated singer-songwriter Laura Marling for a time .
Interestingly , Marling sings about walking up on Holland Avenue with her lover on her I Speak Because I Can track , `` Alpha Shallows . ''
The likelihood is that she is referencing Mumford as she also alludes to his Christian faith - `` He 'd pray up to his God that he might save his soul . ''
-LRB- Mumford 's parents are leaders of the evangelical Vineyard Church in the UK and the singer used to play with banjo player Winston Marshall in a church worship band when they were younger -RRB- .
It could well be that Mumford is singing about breaking up with Marling when he sings at the beginning of this song , `` I ran away in floods of shame .
I 'll never tell how close I came .
As I cross the Holland Road .
You went left and I went right . ''
-LRB- Holland Park Avenue is an upmarket street located in the London districts of Kensington and Chelsea , whilst Holland Road connects Kensington High Street with the Holland Park roundabout . -RRB-
The band wrote the song during a sound check and unveiled it during an in-studio appearance at Colorado radio station KBCO in June 2011 .
Fans subsequently uploaded it under its then title of `` Home . ''
