Ringo told USA Today the album came together effortlessly .
He said : `` I do n't think any song took more than two hours .
On -LSB- 2010 release -RSB- Y Not and this , it started with me holding down a key on the synthesizer , a note and some sort of rhythm pattern .
Then I play drums to that and maracas or piano and a bit of guitar .
There 's no song yet .
It 's like working in reverse , writing the song after the arrangement . ''
Ringo penned the song with American songwriter and producer Glen Ballard , who is best known for co-writing and producing Alanis Morissette 's Jagged Little Pill album .
