Def Leppard 's first single from their 2011 live album , Mirrorball , was debuted on April 12 , 2011 exclusively on Planet Rock 's Rob Birnie Show .
So how come Planet Rock got the song 's first play ?
Probably connected with the fact that the band 's vocalist , Joe Elliott , has his very own Saturday evening show on the channel .
Mirrorball is the band 's first live album , and this is one of three brand new studio recordings on the disc , the others being `` All About Believin ' , ' '' and `` Kings of the World . ''
`` When we decided to do -LRB- the live album -RRB- , it just got said -- I do n't know by who -- ` Why do n't we chuck a couple of new songs on the end ? ' ''
Elliott told Billboard magazine .
`` And that two became three , and in fairness it could 've been four if we 'd just had a little bit more time . ''
The song was composed by Joe Elliott , who described it to Billboard magazine as having `` a very Queen-type vocal thing .
It even features piano and stuff . ''
