This was inspired by frontman Jonathan Higgs wish to write `` an orchestral , sort-of ` Eleanor Rigby ' quartet song , '' but `` it got a bit out of control . ''
Higgs told The Line Of Best Fit : `` We slaved for ages on it .
It was originally just orchestral with a far more electronic accompaniment but we really worked hard to try and get the rest of the band involved in it .
`` Bassist Jeremy Pritchard added that he and the other two band members are `` kind of the sides-men on that song . ''
`` And we 're perfectly happy to be , '' he continued , `` really , because the strings arrangement is central to it .
And if you take that away we 're not really contributing much .
The beat is important and that was vital - finding the right thing for Mike to play , a happy back-beat -LSB- gestures drumming -RSB- '' .
Higgs directed the song 's music video , which sees him perform the track in the aftermath of a volcanic eruption as ash falls down on him .
Speaking to NME about the concept behind it , Higgs said : `` This song is about being with someone you love at the end of the world , even if it 's just the world that you both share . ''
`` I wanted to do something visually related to the ash/concrete bodies found at the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Pompeii , '' he added .
`` They are amazingly powerful to look at and formed by a totally natural , destructive force .
The bodies of the people are huddled together while there is death literally raining down .
That 's what I wanted it to feel like . ''
Higgs references a classic line from the movie Casablanca when he sings : `` Of all the dead volcanoes on Earth , you just happened to retch and roll through mine . ''
