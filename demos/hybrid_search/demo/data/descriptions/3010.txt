This piano-based track finds Brandon Flowers reflecting back after an argument with his girl , as to how deeply they were in love with each other when they were young .
He told the Spotify streaming site .
`` We had -LRB- producer -RRB- Daniel Lanois come to town for a few days and we did so much together .
I 'd had the chorus kicking around for a few years and the band came up with the verse and it all just worked .
It was very quick . ''
This is one of three tracks on Battle Born that the band penned with Daniel Lanois .
Drummer Ronnie Vannucci , Jr told Spinner how The Killers hooked up with the famed producer .
`` We met him a few years ago and sort of kept in touch , '' he explained .
`` Sort of on a whim ... he was in L.A. , we talked about doing the record , seeing if he wants to be involved at all , and produce some s -- t. And the way he produces is , he likes to play .
He 's a player .
He 's a musician first , a producer second , in my opinion .
And he got in there with us and we spent maybe five or six days together and we would just write songs together .
He was in the band for a week .
We would write a song and run it down four or five times , get it right , just dudes on headphones looking at each other . ''
