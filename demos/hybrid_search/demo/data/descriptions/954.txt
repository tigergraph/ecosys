This was a track taken from Brooklyn-based indie rock band Dirty Projectors ' first album for Domino Records .
Pitchfork.com commented to Longstreth that whilst the words on one of this track 's verses is very heart-on-sleeve and emotionally forthright , in the chorus he 's shouting , `` Bitte orca . ''
The interviewer then suggested that as the music becomes joyful , the lyrics are unclear , which almost feels like an evasion .
Longstreth responded : `` I see what you 're saying .
But on the other hand , just getting back to the vibe of that phrase , lyrically , it 's just the sense of the words become aural rather than literal .
I guess I do n't think of it as dodging and weaving in terms of coherence , or you know , like as you were saying , emotional forthrightness .
But yeah , one of the beautiful things about music is how simple and direct a line of communication it is .
And I guess what I want to do , and what we want to do , is try to make music that feels good , and feels expressive - even as it does so in a new vocabulary . ''
Pitchfork.com asked singer/guitarist Dave Longstreth about the meaning of the album title , Bitte Orca .
He replied : `` The word `` bitte '' is just a German word for `` please , '' and `` orca '' is the carnivorous whale .
And I guess you know , there 's not really a literal meaning to draw out of the phrase .
But I like the way the words sound together .
I feel like there 's some kind of sense just in the relation between the two .
Sort of like , ` Please Please Me ' or something .
There 's a part that 's sort of gentle , and supple , and then there 's a part that 's barbed , and demanding .
` Bitte ' is a polite word , but it 's sharp . ''
