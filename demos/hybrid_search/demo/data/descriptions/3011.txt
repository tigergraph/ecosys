Brown explained to Clash Magazine that '' ` Laugh Now ' is just like ` Laugh at me now . '
I 've been around , this is my 6th album , I 've sold out my tour in 2 days now .
Folks Worldwide , people laugh now , by all means .
It 's probably the only dark lyric on it , all the other lyrics are sort of uplifting and sunshine and this one 's a bit kind of bittersweet .
Bit of roses , bittersweet , like I 'll give you a kiss and stab you in the back at the same times .
Bit dark , bit of a dark lyric , yeah .
Again a shout out to anyone who wronged me , I forgive you but go to hell , you know . ''
