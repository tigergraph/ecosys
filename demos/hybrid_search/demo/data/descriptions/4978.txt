This is about the heroes Foo Fighters guitarist and lead singer Dave Grohl had in his life , ordinary people who did extraordinary things .
Many people mistakenly believe this was written about the late Kurt Cobain .
Dave Grohl was a member of Nirvana , and Pat Smear performed with Nirvana during their MTV Unplugged show .
The video shows a young man rescuing many things from his home which is on fire while the band performs in it .
The man 's face is never shown , probably to imply that heroes are everyday people .

When the Foo Fighters learned through news reports that this was happening , they denounced his use of the track .
The band said in a statement : `` The saddest thing about this is that ` My Hero ' was written as a celebration of the common man and his extraordinary potential .
To have it appropriated without our knowledge and used in a manner that perverts the original sentiment of the lyric just tarnishes the song .
`` The Republicans replied that they had obtained and paid for licenses from performing rights organizations to play this song , along with millions of others .
