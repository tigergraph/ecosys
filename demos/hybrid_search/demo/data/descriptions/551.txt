Robert Randolph & the Family Band is a multicultural American funk and soul group .
It is led by pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph , who in September 2003 was listed on Rolling Stone 's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list .
American singer-songwriter and guitarist Peter Case wrote this track while the band were in the studio recording We Walk This Road .
The song speaks out against Christians who criticize those believers who are less `` orthodox '' than others .
In an interview with Crosswalk , Randolph explained that he sees the value in conveying a spiritual message .
But he also understands why some people are reluctant to `` buy-in '' to traditional church systems .
`` Some people are afraid of church , and I sometimes blame believers for that , '' he said .
`` They say , ` Just give your life to Christ and that 's the answer to everything . '
But then we 're left asking , ` What am I supposed to do when I wake up tomorrow ? '
If you split up with your wife , curse somebody out , or get addicted to drugs , instead of offering everyday guidance , church people may say , ' I ca n't believe you did that .
What 's wrong with you ? '
And I would respond , ` Everybody 's gon na do something wrong .
Jesus is and forever will be the only perfect person who 's walked the earth . '
I grew up my whole life going to church .
So I pretty much know what I 'm not supposed to be doing and what I need to do .
I know how I should treat people .
God is the answer to all things , and hopefully that message comes across in our music . ''
