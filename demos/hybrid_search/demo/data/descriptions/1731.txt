Taken by Trees is the solo project of Victoria Bergsman , who is probably best known for her vocal contribution to Peter , Bjorn & John 's international hit , `` Young Folks . ''
This is the opening track from her second album , East Of Eden which Bergsman recorded in Pakistan .
The song features Animal Collective member Noah `` Panda Bear '' Lennox on backing vocals .
East Of Eden also includes a track called `` My Boys , '' a cover of the Animal Collective song `` My Girls . ''
Bergsman explained to DazedDigital why she hooked up with Lennox for this track : `` I 'm just a massive fan of everything Animal Collective does , it 's very playful and warm .
Noah 's got great harmonies , so I emailed him about collaborating and he readily agreed ! ''
