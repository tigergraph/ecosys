Vocalist Jonny Hetherington explained to Gibson.com why this is his favorite track on Vices and Virtues : '' ` Get Thru This ' is a song I wrote a few years back when my father was diagnosed with cancer , and it was a really horrible moment in my life .
He actually survived and he 's cancer-free now , so it 's a big celebration for me every time we play that song , and it 's become very special to me . ''
The tune dates back to 2009 when it was used as the theme song for the WWE Survivor Series pay-per-view-wrestling event .
