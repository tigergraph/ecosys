This was the third single taken from American R&B singer Jeremih 's self-titled debut album .
Jeremih explained to This is RnB how he comes up with the ideas for his songs : `` Sometimes I have a concept in my mind , sometimes I already know where I want to go .
But usually for the most part , we pretty much start from scratch with the snap of my fingers .
While creating a track , I began to hear as if the music speaks to me , as crazy as that sounds .
-LRB- Laughs -RRB- .
I went with what the beats told me , and that 's how we were able to knock out a lot of the records , and pretty much have the beats match a lot with the way I was singing because even when it came to drops .
For instance , in ` Break Up to Make Up ' with the birds chirping in the 2nd verse coming in , you know , it went hand in hand .
We 're doing pretty much everything organically , so that 's how it was created . ''
