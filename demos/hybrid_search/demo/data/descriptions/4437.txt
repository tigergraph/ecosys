This song is about a guy who finds himself constantly being used by women for oral sex .
Steven Tyler often writes playfully sexual lyrics where the woman is in control -LRB- see `` Walk This Way '' -RRB- , and this is a great example .
Our hero gets emotionally involved with these girls , but they just want one thing , and it `` ai n't one of these . ''
If fact , these women do n't even need a man for this , so he 's fighting an uphill battle .
This won for Best Rock Video at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France , for above 2 -RRB- Tyler wrote this with Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry and the producer/songwriter Glen Ballard .
