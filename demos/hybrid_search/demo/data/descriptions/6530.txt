This is one of a number of tracks on Embryonic edited from a free-form jam .
Each of them was named after astrological signs-hence this song 's title .
Frontman Wayne Coyne explained in press notes : `` The most free-form of all the early freakout jams .
Initial recording goes on for about 10 minutes .
This I just a piece of that .
Michael on bass , Steven on wah Rhodes , Kliph doing exploding drums and me on echo 12-string guitar . ''
