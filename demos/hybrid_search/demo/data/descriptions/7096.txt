The song follows the life of a child who is neglected by his parents after the birth of a younger sister .
Many assume this song to be autobiographical of Andrew Gold , yet the artist has denied this , despite great similarities between the lyrics and Gold 's own life .
The lyric , `` He was born on a summer day in 1951 '' matches Gold 's August 1951 birthday , and `` In the summer of '53 his mother/Brought him a sister '' matches his sister 's birthday .
-LRB- thanks , Robert - Oklahoma City , OK -RRB- Linda Ronstadt sang backing vocals on this track .
