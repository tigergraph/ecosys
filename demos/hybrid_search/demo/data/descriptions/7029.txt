When we spoke with Aaron Lewis in 2012 , he explained that certain songs come to him very quickly , and he has little control over them .
`` Forever '' was one of these songs .
Said Lewis : `` That song came vomiting out of me that day - the whole thing came out , just threw up .
I did n't sit down with a pen and paper , I sat down and started playing the chord progression in front of the microphone during sound check .
And the whole song came out , and it leveled me .
I left the stage in tears .
I went to my bus and cried in my bed like a little bitch .
But the whole song came flying out of me.The song never even had a chance to go down on paper .
Actually , I was messing around with a different song , and the chord progression for the chorus for that song , I just kind of re-figured it a little bit , just kind of changed it up a little bit , and that chord progression became the verses of this song .
And it just happened .
I stopped playing the cover that we were messing around with , which we never had any intention of playing , it was literally just to laugh at each other .
I was n't even really thinking about it , and the chord progression kept playing .
And the next thing you know , Ben - the guy who plays with me on stage - started playing this killer lick on the pedal steel along with what I was playing .
And it totally took on a life of its own , and within 30 seconds of us going around in circles on that chord progression with him doing that , the whole song came out . ''
Regarding the meaning of the song , Lewis says , `` There 's self-doubt in relationships and there 's a turnaround at the end of the song that exists now that did n't exist when it first came vomiting out of me . ''
