This was supposed to be released as a single to coincide with their 1979 tour , but it was delayed because of production problems .
As pointed out in the book Hammer of the Gods , Robert Plant wanted this released as a single but Jimmy Page did n't , which also contributed to the delay .
-LRB- thanks , Adrian - Wilmington , DE -RRB- They planned to release this under the name of a fake band so it would not be judged as a Zeppelin song and could compete against the popular Punk bands .
John Bonham died before this could be released .
It was included on Coda , an album of unreleased tracks .
Led Zeppelin never performed this live , but in 1990 , Page and Plant played it at the Knebworth Festival in England .
