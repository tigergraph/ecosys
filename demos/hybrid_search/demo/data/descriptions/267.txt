This song is about a drama queen , the sort of person who makes a drama out of the slightest crisis .
Erasure 's vocalist Andy Bell is known for being quite flamboyant , and his lyrics and stage presence are a great balance for the more grounded Vince Clarke , who handles the programming .
Clarke , who found Bell when he placed an ad in Melody Maker looking for a lead singer , was previously in Depeche Mode and Yazoo , where he wrote songs on his own .
Speaking of collaborating with Bell on songs , he told us : `` Up to Andy , it was a mystery to me how people write songs together .
Andy I , we 've been together a long , long time and we feel very comfortable around each other . ''
