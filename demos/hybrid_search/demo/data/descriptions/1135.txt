This is the second single to be taken from Californian electro-hip-hop group , LMFAO 's debut album , Party Rock .
DJ/rapper Redfoo said of the video to MTV News : `` We do , like , a Weird Science thing where we create two girls .
There are backgrounds and it 's all green-screen , so there 's things floating in the sky .
And here 's the cool part : We are going to make an application online and on the iPhone where you are going to be able to place your picture , or the person you have a crush on , you can put their pictures on our bodies , and any other bodies that are on there .
Now you are in the video ! ''
