This Rock ballad opens with a clean-sounding electric guitar with no mics on the instrument , just on the amps .
Guitarist Synyster Gates told MusicRadar.com : `` We stumbled onto it by accident , actually .
There were a few secrets in getting it , mainly that it 's a baritone guitar with a capo on it so I could play it in open E standard tuning .
It has a really sick , rich , sparkly sound . ''
Speaking with Kerrang !
magazine August 31 , 2013 , vocalist Matthew `` M. Shadows '' Sanders explained the background to the song 's upbeat lyrics .

For me , it 's about my son . ''
