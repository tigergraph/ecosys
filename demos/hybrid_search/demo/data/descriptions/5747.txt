Gabrielle Gardiner is a British singer-songwriter from Stevenage , Hertfordshire , who records under the name of Gabz .
She first came to the notice of the British public when she reached the final of the seventh series of Britain 's Got Talent in 2013 .
She finished in seventh place with 3.6 % of the vote .
This is her debut single , which was released on June 30 , 2013 via Sony Music .
The self-penned track is about heartbreak .
However , Gabz told The Metro that she has yet to personally experience a break up so she took her inspiration from films that she had seen .
Gabz premiered the song , aged 14 , at her audition for Britain 's Got Talent , performing the tune at a piano .
She sung the song again during the live semi-finals with a backing track and also in the live final , where she crooned it as a melody with another self-written song , `` Lie There . ''
