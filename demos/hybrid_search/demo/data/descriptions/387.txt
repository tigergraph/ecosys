This celebratory song contains a second generation sample .
In 1987 DJ Mark the 45 King lifted the baritone sax solo from Marva Whitney 's `` Unwind Yourself '' and made a breakbeat called `` The 900 Number . ''
DJ Mark 's tune has subsequently been resampled by many artists including Miller 's producer ID Labs for `` Party . ''
Another well known use of the track was by Washington , D.C.-based go-go artist DJ Kool for his 1996 hit , `` Let Me Clear My Throat .
`` DJ Mark went on to become a successful producer , providing the beats for Eminem 's `` Stan '' and Jay-Z 's `` Hard Knock Life .
The song 's music video features Mac Miller and his crew dressed as elderly men , complete with mobility scooters and canes .
Miller recalled to Billboard magazine : `` For the video , I told E , ` we should all be old people . '
We decided to do it more tongue in cheek so we went and hit the costume store and got some gray wigs .
We all had a blast .
The song 's called ` Party On Fifth Ave ' but rarely do you see a party in the video .
It 's more -LSB- of -RSB- the feeling you get .
It 's an old school sample so I felt like , that 's old people , it works . ''
Miller told Billboard magazine how he had to force I.D. Labs to use DJ Mark 's sample .
He said : `` I was like ` Yo , we got to flip this and do a new version of this .
Man , it 'd be so dope . '
Everyone was like , ` That 's one of your corny ideas , man .
That 's corny . '
I was like ' E -LSB- E Dans of I.D. Labs -RSB- , make this beat , please , man .
Trust me , just make it .
It will be the jam . '
So he made it . ''
