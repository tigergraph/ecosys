This is a single from the British five-piece rock band Frankie & The Heartstrings .
Guitarist Michael McKnight explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` A bitter account of a relationship ending just when you thought everything was too good to be true .
We were listening to a lot of Josef K at the time and I think you can really hear it in the guitars and bass line . ''
