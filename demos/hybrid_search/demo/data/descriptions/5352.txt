This Spanish-language acoustic ballad is the title track of the folk-gypsy Venezuela-reared singer-songwriter Devendra Banhart 's eighth studio album .
The song and album title is the Serbian word for `` small , '' but used colloquially in Eastern Europe as a cutesy colloquial nickname given to significant others like ` sweetie pie . '
It was a working name offhandedly inspired by a ring Banhart 's fianc√©e , the Serbian photographer and artist Ana Kras , had given him with that word on it .
But the name stuck .
