This song is about moving out of a house that is pumped full of bad memories .
Nick Lowe told The Huffington Post that it is not autobiographical in any way : `` One day driving along , I saw that written up , ` House for sale . '
It 's a phrase you see everywhere , all the time - not particularly because of the times we 're living in at the moment , but just in ordinary day-to-day living , you see that phrase .
One day , it just struck me that it had some melody to it , and I thought that it could be fun to hang a little song around it .
It 's a very straightforward song without any hidden meaning in it , and it 's certainly not autobiographical .
I do n't really do too much autobiographical stuff .
I know what I 'm writing about , but I do n't put my diary to music , if you know what I 'm talking about . ''
The Old Magic was Lowe 's thirteenth solo album .
Lowe told The Huffington Post that he did not set out to record an album , rather , The Old Magic was the result of an `` ongoing work '' : `` Well , I tend not to record albums as a ` piece ' because I 'm not really that prolific .
I 'll wait until I 've got three or four tunes , and then I 'll round everybody up and we 'll go record them .
Then , quite a long time might go by before I 've got three or four more that I think can turn out okay .
So , it 's not really a project , each record .
It 's more of an ongoing work .
Yeah , that 's really how it works . ''
Elsewhere asked Lowe if this song was inspired by the old music standard , `` A Cottage For Sale . ''
Lowe denied this at first , but upon reflection , realized they could be right : `` No , I do n't know that but ... wait a minute a bell is ringing .
I remember the sentiment , I can understand immediately where it is coming from - you and I know what it means to pass up our possessions .
Hm , so absolutely at a subconscious level that is where it came from .
I think you are absolutely right .
I must dig that out , it might be frighteningly close . ''
