This is a track from American alternative/shoegaze band Silversun Pickups ' second studio album , Swoon .
The song 's music video was directed by sibling team the Malloys -LRB- N.E.R.D. , The White Stripes , Kid Rock -RRB- .
Silversun Pickups frontman Brian Aubert told MTV News about the clip : `` It 's cool .
It 's gon na be weird .
We 're playing the song in a surreal moose lodge , and then there 's musical chairs going on with , like , eight Amazon-type gorgeous girls .
Babes , I suppose .
They were actually playing musical chairs for , like , a real prize - it got pretty ugly .
Everybody in the room watching it was like , ` This is the weirdest thing . '
All the girls are color-coded .
In one way , it 's bright and sort of silly , but the way we 're looking at it is sort of depressing .
In fact , I have to admit : It 's by far the darkest video we 've ever done . ''
