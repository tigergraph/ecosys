This is the opening track of California alternative rock band Say Anything 's self-titled fourth album .
Frontman Max Bemis told Alternative Press : `` Ironically , this is the first song I wrote for the record , and it also became the first song on the record .
It 's pretty much a statement of purpose about what I think is wrong with the world or what is worth fighting against in the world .
It covers two aspects : one is someone who is irresponsible and the other is one who claims too much responsibility and is obsessed with power .
Both of which I think are two things wrong with society - people who do those things . ''
