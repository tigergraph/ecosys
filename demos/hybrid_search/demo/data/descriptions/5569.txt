This ballad is the lead single from the soundtrack to the movie The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 and is performed by American Pop singer Bruno Mars .
He penned the tune whilst out on the road and produced it with his Smeezingtons production colleagues , Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine .
It was released exclusively on iTunes September 27 , 2011 .
Speaking to Billboard magazine , Mars explained that `` the Twilight movies , `` for me -LSB- are -RSB- a love story .
But it 's a dark love story .
And I think the best way to describe the song is : it 's the darker side of love .
I think that pretty much sums it up .
` It Will Rain ' started off with me and the guitar , and I just had this melody in my head and basically laid it down after I saw the film . ''
Bruno Mars literally turned off the radio when he first heard this song because of his displeasure with its final mix .
`` I felt like I was a mosquito singing , '' he told Billboard magazine .
Mars had already started on the song before he got the call to contribute to the film 's soundtrack .
After seeing the movie , he thought that it would be `` a perfect fit . ''
According to an interview with AP writer Ryan Pearson , Twilight music producer Alexandra Patsavas chose Mars as the film centered on a wedding and , `` Who more appropriate than Bruno Mars to write a timeless , classic wedding song ? ''
