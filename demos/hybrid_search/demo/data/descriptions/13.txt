Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy has battled a painkiller addiction , which he hints at in the lyrics , `` I kill my memory with a cheap disease . ''
Asked about the line by Rolling Stone , Tweedy replied : `` A lot of ` Sunloathe ' is mocking the internally manufactured abyss of addiction .
It 's a common thread in a lot of my songs - being angry at my own self-pity , or self-pity in general , in the face of the real suffering in the world . ''
The song 's animated music video follows four misunderstood monsters on a journey to reunite .
The clip was directed by theater and film director Peter Glantz , who started off as Roger Corman 's assistant .
Amongst the other works on his resume is the 2003 music documentary Lightning Bolt - Power Of Salad .
The trippy art is by Nathaniel Murphy , who previously provided several illustrations for the liner booklet of 2007 's Sky Blue Sky .
