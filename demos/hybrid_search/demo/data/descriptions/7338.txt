This Jonathan Singleton and Tim Nichols penned song was one of the three potential singles McCreery had to choose from for his post-American Idol debut single .
It eventually lost out to `` I Love You This Big . ''
Said Scotty of the song in publicity materials : `` It 's about a summertime fair and it 's a teenage love kind of thing .
They could have had something , but they ran out of summertime .
It 's almost like the movie Grease , with Danny and Sandy . ''
