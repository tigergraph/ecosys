Annie Clark , aka St. Vincent , told NME that she is particularly partial to this song `` because it 's quite strange . ''
She explained : `` I like the textures and syncopation in that song very much .
I 'm very fond of it , and of playing it .
With ` Chloe . . '
it needed to sound breathless , right , because it 's a song about sex , so it needed to sound high and breathless .
It just did n't make sense in my brain any other way !
So I had to sing it just a little too high ... ''
