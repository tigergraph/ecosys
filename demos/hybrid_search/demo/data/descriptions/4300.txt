Rev Theory -LRB- formerly known as Revelation Theory -RRB- is an American hard rock band based out of New York .
This is the title track and first single off their third studio album , which was released on iTunes on October 25 , 2010 , and to radio stations on November 2 , 2010 .
Rev Theory wrote the song in 2006 along with the band Mercy Fall , with whom the New Yorkers toured .
`` We wrote the tune together , and they actually ended up demoing it themselves , '' guitarist Julien Jorgensen recalled to Billboard magazine .
`` Then they got dropped by Atlantic and we were like , ` That song 's perfect for us and for our time right now . '
It 's indicative of everything we were going through in the music industry ; there 's this feeling of vindication , like it 's about getting what 's ours .
So we figured it was time to put it on our album . ''
