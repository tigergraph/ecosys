Caleb Followill explained to The Music Fix why they titled this mellow cali-pop tune `` Beach Side '' : '' ` Beach Side ' is funny because the reason it 's called ` Beach Side ' is because it was declared a ` B-Side ' on the record .
And , so , the whole time it was on the board it was written down as ` B-Side . '
`` He continued : `` And I was like , ` man , we ca n't call it `` B-Side . ' ''
We started to really like the song at that point .
And my little brother had went to a Beach House concert the night before .
And he walked in with a Beach House shirt on and I said , ' I got it .
Let 's call the song ` Beach Side ! ' ''
and everyone 's like ` yeah ! .
It 's perfect . '
And then after having said that , it 's almost as if the sound of the song in all of our heads started to sound beach-y . ''
Matthew Followill explained to The Music Fix how they developed this song 's ` beach-y ' sound : `` Nathan had a very '70s drum tone that we were all really excited about that .
Had the lap steel , but had n't really written a part for that yet , but I knew I wanted to use it .
So , me and Jared got into the guitar room and wrote a part .
And it ended up sounding beach-y and '70s . ''
