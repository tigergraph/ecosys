This song features a vocal and piano contribution from Elton John .
The Pulse Of Radio asked Queens frontman Josh Homme how he snagged the English legend to play on the record .
`` It actually stemmed from an old roommate of mine , who drives really high-end folks around now , and Elton was in the car listening to Them Crooked Vultures , I guess , '' he said .
`` And his assistant was saying , ` Oh , you 've got to hear Queens , the other band of this guy , ' you know .
And because my old roommate was driving the car , it was like , ` Do you want to talk to him ? '
And I just got a phone call at my house on a Sunday .
You know , he said , ` The only thing missing from your band is an actual queen , ' and I said , ` Honey , you have no idea . ' ''
Homme recalled to MTV News : '' `` I think he assumed we 'd have some ballad that was already recorded that he would play on , but what was great was the realization ` Oh , we 're going to play a rock song , we 're going to track it live and it 's going to happen . '
`` We worked together , and so what you get is this performance. , '' he continued `` And that was nice to have that experience together .
And then he was gracious enough to say ` I 'll come back and sing . ' ''
A fairweather friend is somebody who is loyal when you are flourishing but desert as soon as your fortunes change .
John Cale , Johnny Gill and Vanessa Carlton have all recorded songs with the same title .
Elton John told MTV News that the nature of the collaboration came at a weird time .
`` Engelbert Humperdinck had written me a very sweet letter and asked me to sing a duet with him , '' he explained .
`` He is part of my history and I could n't say no so I went and recorded a song with him .
Then I drove three blocks and went from Engelbert to Queens Of The Stone Age . ''
Homme recalled Elton 's contribution to NME : `` We gave him ` Fairweather Friends ' , which is not an easy song to learn .
All the piano is him .
He started by playing nothing but the root of the song , which is so amazing and respectful and experienced .
Then , after about 20 minutes he was just like , -LRB- Puts English accent on -RRB- , ` I 'm gon na start flowering it out a little bit . '
To watch him do that was just f -- ing badass .
We played for three-and a half hours .
That 's how long it took to get it . ''
