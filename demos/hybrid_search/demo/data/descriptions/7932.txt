Bassist Chris Wolstenholme wrote this Beach Boys-inspired song about his struggles with booze even after he 'd stopped drinking .
He told NME : '' ` Save Me ' was about having the family , the wife and kids who , despite all the crap that I 've put them through , at the end of it you realize they 're still there and they 're the ones who pulled you through . ''
Wolstenholme also performs the vocals on this track .
So why did the band allow their bassist to sing this ?
`` I was into it because they were songs that were personal to him , '' frontman Matt Bellamy told NME .
`` It 's like this new guy - the last time I remember meeting this guy was about 10 years ago .
He seems to be so energized about everything .
I think he almost feel like he 's woken up . ''
