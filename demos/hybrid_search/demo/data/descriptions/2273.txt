This is the opening track on Broken Bride , which is a Rock Opera about a man whose wife dies in a car accident in 1989 .
After 15 years of mourning , he creates a time machine to go back and save her .
However , due to a miscalculation , he crashes in the Jurassic with dinosaurs and `` pterodactyls swarming . ''
However , despite facing death , his main focus is still to go back and save his wife .
