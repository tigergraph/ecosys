Wainwright described this song to Spinner as `` the most visceral song '' on Out of the Game .
He explained : `` There 's a kind of intensity and focus that reminds me of certain Elton John or Fleetwood Mac songs , these uptempo numbers that are at the same time incredibly emotional and war-like , which is exciting but also a little scary .
It 's a very private song , about a person being a city , and that city being Jericho .
It 's a biblical mystery . ''
Situated well below sea level 10 miles north of the Dead Sea , the Palestinian city of Jericho is the lowest permanently inhabited site on earth .
It also lays claim to being one of the oldest cities in the world .
Described in the Old Testament as the `` City of Palm Trees '' , abundant springs in and around Jericho have made it an attractive site for human habitation since around 9500BC .
By about 8000 BC it had grown into a town of 2,000 people .
It was subsequently established and abandoned many times including being completed destroyed by the children of Israel , led by Joshua in around 1400BC .
-LRB- You might recall the story recounted in the Old Testament book of Joshua of how Jericho was captured after its city walls collapsed . -RRB-
Today , it is the capital of the Jericho Governorate and has a population of over 20,000 .
