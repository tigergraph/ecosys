Patrick Stump told Kerrang !
that he was nervous about his vocal contribution to this Rock anthem : `` It was a really hard song for me , '' he said .
`` I 'm much more comfortable now , and very happy with the way I am compared with how I used to be , but I 'm very scared of my voice .
I do n't like hearing it .
My natural instinct is ` more guitars , more instruments , more voices ' , so I have something to hide behind .
`` The song came very close to not making it on the record , '' he continued .
`` One of the old Fall Out Boy ways was that we did n't really speak up around each other .
If someone was fighting for something , everyone would back off .
I was kind of doing that with this song , but then we had this chain e-mail where everyone voted yay or nay .
Everyone went yay except for me . ''
Stump does a little laugh after singing ` a -- holes . '
He told Kerrang !
: `` That was real !
The recording you hear was probably the first take , because I was laughing about the little wink to the audience . ''
