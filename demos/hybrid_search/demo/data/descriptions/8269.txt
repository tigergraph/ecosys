Collins co-wrote this track with former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr .
He told The Sun : `` Johnny Marr called just before we were about to master it and asked if I fancied doing a track because he had an idea .
So of course we had to find room for that , which became ` Come Tomorrow , Come Today . ' ''
