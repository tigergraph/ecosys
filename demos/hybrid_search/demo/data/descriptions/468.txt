This saxophone-driven instrumental is the work of the Danish DJ and record producer Rune , also known as Enur .
The track was big during the summer of 2003 on the Ibiza dance music scene .
Two years later `` Calabria '' was mixed with Crystal Waters vocals from a dance song called `` Destination Unknown . ''
The result was `` Destination Calabria , '' a # 4 hit in the UK .
In 2007 , Rune , now calling himself Enur , revisited `` Calabria '' once again , this time with vocals from Danish Reggae star Natasja Saad .
The song was released as `` Calabria 2007 . ''
