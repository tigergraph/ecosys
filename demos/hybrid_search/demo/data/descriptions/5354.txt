This ballad was written by Lee Brice , Jerrod Niemann and Jon Stone .
Shelton commented to Wendy Geller of Yahoo Music : `` It 's so honest , so much fun , it 's sweet .
Girls absolutely love that song .
But guys can get into it too , because it 's just a fun love song . ''
Niemann explained to Radio.com how a song he wrote about his dream girl wound up on Hillbilly Bone .
`` Me and Lee Brice we 're sitting at my house and just decided to write a song about the girl of our dreams , '' he recalled .
`` It 's about a girl who likes to party and is not scared to look hungover .
It 's sort of silly but we wrote it over music that 's hopefully fun to dance to and Blake Shelton recorded it . ''
