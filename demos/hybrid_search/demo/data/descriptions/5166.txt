This Merseybeat-echoing ballad documents the doomed collapse of a hedonistic relationship .
Guitarist and principal songwriter Serge Pizzorno told Q magazine : `` I 've never really written a song like this before .
I had this beautiful tune for ages and did n't know what to do with it .
It 's got a Phil Spector , Burt Bacharach kind of feel .
It 's about a self-destructive love affair , one which is great for a bit but you both know it ca n't last or someone is going to die .
And Tom 's vocals are genius . ''
A live video was shot for the song , which in addition to the normal Kasabian quintet , also features live keyboardist Ben Kealey and trumpet player Gary Alesbrook .
Regarding the video release , the band said on their official website : `` Shot in no-nonsense , classic black and white , it captures the band live on stage during their massive gigs at London 's O2 . ''
Pizzorno told NME he has `` a tendency to be attracted to the darker side of the personality - creatively .
He continued : '' ` Goodbye Kiss ' is a break-up song .
It 's not , ` we fell in love and everything worked out ' , it 's like ` we had a great time , but its f -- ked now .
You ` best f -- king walk away . '
I probably go there quite often . ''
