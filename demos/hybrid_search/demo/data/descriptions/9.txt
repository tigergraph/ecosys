Lead singer Scott Stapp wrote this about his struggles with life at a time when he was questioning his faith .
He realized he had created a prison within his own mind .
After Creed became wildly popular -LRB- and at the same time , reviled -RRB- , Stapp created another kind of prison for himself with drug addiction , alcoholism , and a series of unflattering incidents the tabloids lapped up .
In 2012 , he was able to take an honest look at his life and re-evaluate his priorities , which he wrote about in his memoir Sinner 's Creed .
When we spoke with Stapp the following year , he explained , `` Any time we have reconciliation in life , and any time there 's balance brought back into life and perspective , at the end of those things , you find peace and joy and contentment , and that 's where my life is today . ''
This was Creed 's first single .
It was a great example of the confessional songwriting that would become Stapp 's hallmark .
The singer says that expressing his deepest emotions and his vulnerabilities in his songs is cathartic for him .
