This synth-heavy number about love on the dance floor is the second European single by American pop recording artist Miley Cyrus , from her third studio album , Ca n't Be Tamed .
Miley wrote the song with Antonina Armato , Tim James , Devrim Karaoglu and Paul NZA .
The music video was filmed on August 7 , 2010 in Detroit , Michigan .
It was directed by Robert Hales , who also helmed the clip for `` Ca n't Be Tamed . ''
The racy clip shows Cyrus writhing semi-naked on a bed before getting dolled up in her room and grooving in the backseat of a car clad in tiny shorts .
The singer came under fire from concerned parental groups - not the first time Cyrus has provoked a reaction as she attempts to break away from her clean image as a teen star .
Tim Winter , president of the Parents Television Council , insisted to TMZ.com that the footage sends the wrong message to Cyrus ' young fans .
He said : `` It is unfortunate that she would participate in such a sexualized video like this one.It sends messages to her fan base that are diametrically opposed to everything she has done up to this point .
Miley built her fame and fortune entirely on the backs of young girls , and it saddens us that she seems so eager to distance herself from that fan base so rapidly . ''
