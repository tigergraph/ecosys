This was written by the husband and wife duo of Antonina Armato and Tim James plus Karaoglu .
Armato and James are co founders of the Rock Mafia record production/songwriting team , who have written for Selena since her debut album .
Their contributions to her catalogue include the singles `` Naturally '' and `` Love You Like a Love Song . ''
Selena discussed the song in an interview with Billboard magazine .
She said : '' ` My Dilemma ' is my Kelly Clarkson kind of pop rock .
You have to have a break up song .
You have to have one of those songs about a boy that drives you crazy .
It 's really just one of those songs that I can sing over and over and over again .
I went into the studio three times to record that song and we did different things with it and we tried to re-record the bridge and rework the pre-choruses and it was just one of those songs I was addicted to . ''
