This rock ballad finds vocalist Alex Turner singing a tribute to his belle .
He told NME about the recording : `` It 's just a love song I suppose .
In terms of the sound I guess some of the stuff we were listening to was like the Pixies .
And having the drums quite tough , that comes across on that tune a bit . ''
