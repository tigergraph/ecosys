Founded in Long Beach , California , by vocalist/guitarist Bradley Nowell , drummer Bud Gaugh and bass player Eric Wilson in 1988 , Sublime was one of the most successful and influential ska-punk bands of all time .
Fueled by such radio hits as `` What I Got , '' the group achieved worldwide sales in excess of 17 million , but disbanded following Nowell 's untimely death in 1996 .
In 2009 Gaugh and Wilson teamed up with singer/guitarist Rome Ramirez for a series of shows .
Buoyed by the extraordinarily positive response , the band embarked on a worldwide headline tour .
In March 2011 the band entered the studio to begin recording their debut album , with Butthole Surfers guitarist Paul Leary producing .
This is the lead single from the LP which is titled , Yours Truly .
