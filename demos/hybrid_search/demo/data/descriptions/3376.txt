This is a single taken from Tribalism , a companion album to Enter Shikari 's 2009 album Common Dreads .
The compilation record contains b-sides , remixes , live tracks plus two new songs-this single and the title track .
The song 's music video was directed by multi-award winning short film director Joseph Pierce .
The promo was Pierce 's first video and it utilizes a type of animation called rotoscoping , which was pioneered on A-Ha 's award-winning clip for `` Take On Me . ''
Rotoscoping involves animators tracing over live-action film movement , frame by frame .
After shooting the band 's performance , Joseph hand-illustrated an extraordinary 2500 frames from the edit for the final version of this clip .
