Big Wreck split up after their 2001 album The Pleasure and the Greed , with lead singer Ian Thornley forming a band called Thornley .
They re-formed for the 2012 Albatross album , which was successful in their native Canada , earning a Juno nomination for Rock Album of the Year .
Regarding this song , Thornley said in his Songfacts interview : `` A lot of my own personal stuff tends to find its way into the music .
And that 's how I stay really , really umbilically connected to it .
I have a lot of tour writing that 's completely third person , like a Bruce Springsteen or like a Bob Dylan - Gordon Downie -LSB- lead singer of The Tragically Hip -RSB- even is great at that .
I have a hard time writing like that .
I think that 's real grown up writing , and I 'd like to be able to do it some day .
I 'm not quite there yet .
So I tend to take slices of my own life and sort of embellish them .
` All Is Fair ' is a direct result of that , for sure . ''
The dueling guitars at the end of this song provide a memorable close .
Ian Thornley told us : `` To me the whole outro of ` Always Fair , ' the argument between the guitars , we were actually trying to make it sound like an argument that was coming to a heated pitch and then comes to and end .
But all the songs , almost all of them , are relationship songs .
Maybe not necessarily with a loved one or with a wife or girlfriend or whatever , even with a colleague .
That might be one of the better ones as far as a romantic relationship , trying to describe it . ''
