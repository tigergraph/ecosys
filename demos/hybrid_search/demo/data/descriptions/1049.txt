This breezy love song is the first single from psyche-folk singer-songwriter Devandra Banhart 's seventh studio album , What Will We Be .
What Will We Be was recorded in a studio that Banhart built in a wood cabin in a sleepy Northern California town .
Banhart and Paul Butler from UK 's Band of Bees co-produced the album .
Banhart explained to Clash Magazine how he hooked up with Butler : `` My bass player was working on his solo record and played me ` Chicken Payback ' and I freaked out .
I love their song writing , I love the whole band 's vibe .
The sound was so good , I immediately started sending them love letters , hoping for a moderate degree of antipathy from him .
And then , as that progressed , we started sharing songs , and I said , 'S -- t , want to come to California and maybe record this record with me ? '
And he said , ` Yeah ' , and came down from the Isle of Wight .
`` Banhart added : `` What he really brought to the table was his musicality .
For the first time ever he got me to do an hour-long vocal warm-up before every take .
I think it adds more of a hotch potch . ''
The album is Banhart 's major-label debut for Warner Brothers .
The label 's executive VP of marketing , Diarmuid Quinn , told Billboard magazine that this sprightly R&B flavored groover was chosen as the album 's lead single as , `` everybody felt was a pretty accessible step for him , while maintaining what he does so well and his identity . ''
Banhart explained to Rolling Stone how he came upon the title for What Will We Be : `` I find myself meditating on Kleenex and thinking about how it used to be a tree '' he revealed , `` and what will I be , and sometimes I feel like my soul is blowing its nose on my body , so somehow a title came out about that . ''
