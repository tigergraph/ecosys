This was the song that sparked off the New Kids on the Block reunion .
New Kid Donnie Wahlberg was in New York for a costume fitting for the movie Righteous Kill and found himself close to the office of his longtime music lawyer .
He popped in and while there he was handed a demo tape of a young singer-songwriter named Nazeree -LRB- also known as Nasri -RRB- .
A few days later Wahlberg put on the CD whilst driving .
He recalled on the New Kids online bio : `` The first song was called ` Click , Click , Click ' and from the minute it started , it just grabbed me .
I kept waiting for this kid to falter , but he never did .
Not only that - I immediately recognized that Joey McIntryre is going to love this record , Jordan Knight is going to love this record and I love this record .
The music speaks to all of our sensibilities , but they 're all totally different .
It was hip-hop and honest enough for me .
It was soulful enough for Jordan and pop and unselfish enough for Joe .
It just had it all .
I spent the next few hours driving up to girls at red lights and playing them the song .
They said , ` Is that your song ?
I said ` Not yet . '
`` Wahlberg was suddenly energized and drove to Jordan Knight 's house that night and played him the songs .
He recalled : `` I told him .
` Jordan , this could be the moment right here . '
Jordan heard ` Click , Click , Click ' and he loved it .
Then I emailed them to Joe and the same reaction - and more importantly his wife cried .
So I pulled out my checkbook and we started going . ''
