Calexico frontman Joey Burns -LRB- from Uncut magazine October 2008 -RRB- : `` For the song Red Blooms , my eldest brother John and I were talking about this news item about ` snowdrops , ' who are people who go missing during the winter in Russia .
They fall in the snow .
The snow piles up , and everyone is praying they are found .
It 's a beautiful metaphor for transformation . ''
