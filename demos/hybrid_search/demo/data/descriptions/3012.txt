Daniel Stein , aka DJ Fresh , told The Independent how he came to write this song : `` I was just listening to some old Disco records and I 've always loved big falsetto vocal hooks and that kind of Motown and Disco energy , '' he said .
`` I came up with this hook while I was on the way into town really late for a meeting . ''
The song features rapper Dizzee Rascal .
Said Stein to The Independent : `` When I heard Dizzee was into it and he started sending across ideas , I was amped - it was like it was meant to be , he was perfect for it . ''
