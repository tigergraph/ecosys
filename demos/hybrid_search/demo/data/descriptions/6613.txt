This track is named after a friend of the band , the difficult lead singer of cult English indie band Television Personalities .
MGMT 's Andrew VanWyngarden explained to ShockHound : `` We did a couple of tracks with him last fall in England , and now we kinda meet up with him in London whenever we go .
And he 's written songs for lots of people - he likes writing about people , even though they 're usually not people that I know .
So this was just a song for him . ''
MGMT invited Treacy 's band to support them on a couple of dates when touring the UK in 2008 .
`` Nobody in the audience knew who the Television Personalities were , '' VanWyngarden recalled to The Guardian .
`` Dan 's reaction was to be even more obnoxious and just , like , try to piss them off . ''
