Nick Lowe embraces his sensitivity in this song .
Lowe told The Huffington Post that he was inspired by the Soul singer , Sam Cooke : `` That was a song that came about as I was reading Peter Guralnick 's excellent book about Sam Cooke , Dream Boogie : The Triumph Of Sam Cooke , and I came up with this song .
It sounded so much like a Sam Cooke song that I could n't use it - it was like the Sam Cooke song that Sam Cooke did n't do .
So , I left it for about a year , and then one day , I got it out of the box mentally , so to speak , and started fiddling around with it , and out that one came . ''
The Old Magic was Lowe 's thirteenth solo album .
Lowe told KLRU that the album was influenced by old music standards : `` There 's no doubt I 'm very drawn to that classic songwriting style .
It is nice when it comes along .
It feels like it has been around for a great while . ''
This song spawned Lowe 's first music video in 18 years .
The video stars several comedians , including Marc Maron , Tim Heidecker and Rich Fulcher , as well as the band , Wilco , who Lowe toured with in 2011 .
