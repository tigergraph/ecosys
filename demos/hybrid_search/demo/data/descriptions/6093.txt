This song about the death of a loved one was written by Shelly Poole formerly of the Top 20 recording act Alisha 's Attic , and Andy Hill who co-penned most of Bucks Fizz 's hits in the 1980s .
Kian Egan of Westlife commented to The Irish Times : `` The first time I heard it , it nearly broke my heart , but then as I kept listening to it , I thought that it really fits .
Anybody in the world who hears this song will see that it really means something for anybody who was lost somebody .
It will really touch them emotionally . ''
