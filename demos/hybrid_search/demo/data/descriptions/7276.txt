This ballad was the debut single and first hit for American Country music singer Jimmy Wayne .
The music video , which portrays Wayne singing and playing guitar in a desert was directed by Trey Fanjoy .
The Country singer told Great American Country TV that he learned a valuable lesson on his debut promo clip .
Said Wayne : `` We were in Sedona , Arizona , and obviously it was my first video .
The thing that I remember the most was they played the song , and I was supposed to lip-sync .
I did n't know that , so I thought that you were actually supposed to sing the song .
So I 'm out there singing like crazy .
`` After a number of takes , Wayne found he was losing his voice and he wondered how all the other artists make it through a long day of singing on film .
`` I got hoarse at the video shoot , '' he said . ''
-LSB- Then -RSB- they told me you were n't actually supposed to be singing . ''
