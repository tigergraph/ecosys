This features the Jazz singer Sylvia Gordon from the band Kudu .
Moby told The Sun newspaper May 8 , 2008 about her contribution to this song : `` Sylvia had been up for two days straight .
She had written these lyrics on the subway and sang a rough demo and it was perfect .
She came to re-record but the demo was faultless .
You can almost hear the exhaustion in her voice as she had been awake all night .
She was in that state between still being drunk and hung-over . ''
Moby told Uncut magazine February 2008 : `` I was maybe taking myself a little too seriously on the last record -LRB- 2005 's Hotel -RRB- .
So Last Night is inspired by wanting to make a record that was more fun .
It reminds me of when I started DJ ` ing here in New York in the late '80s .
You 'd go out to a club and hear hip hop , punk , disco , house and reggae . ''
Moby told The Sun : `` It 's my favourite track on the album , which is strange as it 's the only track on the record which is n't a dance record - it has no drums . ''
Moby on his website : '' ` Last Night ' is basically a love letter to dance music in New York City .
what I love about the New York approach to dance music is the eclecticism and the open minded-ness on the part of the musicians , the DJ 's , and the people in the bars and clubs .
in making Last Night I essentially tried to take a long 8 hour night out in New York City and condense it into a 65 minute long album . ''
