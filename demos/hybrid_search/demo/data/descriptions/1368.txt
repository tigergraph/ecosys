Goulding admitted to MTV News that she is not necessarily a fan of Stephanie Meyer 's Twilight series , but was still enthusiastic about lending this song to the final installment .
`` I 'm not a Twi-hard but I take it for what it is ; it 's a cool thing and I can see why There 's a huge fanbase .
-LSB- And -RSB- they choose the best stuff for the soundtrack , so I 'm really lucky to be a part of that ! ''
she explained .
Goulding produced the song with her then-boyfriend , the EDM musician Skrillex .
She told MTV News that though the tune turned out to be a perfect fit for the movie 's storyline , that was n't her intention upon writing it .
`` Myself and Skrillex got together in the studio and started working on this song , and it 's about waking up in the morning and hoping that the person feels the same way as you , '' she said .
`` For some reason , every single lyric just ended up relating to this film .
And I think when it was played at some point to the Twilight people , they were like , ` Oh my God ! '
So they asked us if we were interested in being on the soundtrack and we were like , ` Hell yeah ! ' ''
