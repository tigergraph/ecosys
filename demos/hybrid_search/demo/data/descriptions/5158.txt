Hillsong are an Australian Christian Rock and worship band who originated at Hillsong Church , a Pentecostal ministry based in northwest Sydney .
This is a track from their third studio album , Zion , which reached # 5 on the US Billboard 200 as well as topping the Australian ARIA Albums Chart .
This track was penned by Hillsong member Joel Houston .
He told Billboard magazine : `` This song is one that we had the title before the lyrics .
It 's a picture of the fact that sometimes we spend so much time and effort fighting the wrong battles - but the fight is to surrender . ''
`` We fight to cling to all these things we have control over to be successful to put all the pieces together to be happy and do what we think we are intended to do , '' he added .
`` But if we would just realize that the fight is to surrender daily and when we allow ourselves to do this , we can go about loving the way God has called us to love - and that example is in Jesus .
I 'm going to let go of all control and surrender to fight for love as Christ fought for us . ''
