Strong of opinion , London-based singer-songwriter Eliza Doolittle penned this downtempo lament about her propensity to sometimes engage mouth before brain .
She explained : `` It 's about me getting myself into a bit of trouble by being a bit blunt sometimes and saying the wrong thing .
I need to try to be aware of being sensitive to other people 's feelings .
I do regret my mouth sometimes ... but then sometimes I think , well , that 's what I think , it does n't matter .
But maybe I 'm still growing up ! ''
