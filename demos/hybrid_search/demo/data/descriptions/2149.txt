This is the title track from the American alternative country singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams ' tenth studio album .
The song describes people that upend social norms , including a girl who sells flowers on the street setting an example of how to live .
Williams told American Songwriter she 'd scribbled that particular image down on a napkin .
`` There was this young girl who used to come in and sell roses in this Mexican restaurant we go in .
She 's not just some girl selling roses .
She has a family .
She has a life . ''
