This is the opening track from American R&B and recording artist Mariah Carey 's twelfth studio album , Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel .
Carey wrote and produced the entire album in collaboration with The-Dream and Tricky Stewart , the hitmaking duo behind Rihanna 's `` Umbrella '' and Beyonc√© 's `` Single Ladies . ''
Carey said in publicity materials : `` My main goal was to work with people I could collaborate with without it seeming redundant or stale .
In my opinion Tricky is one of the most underrated major producers out there right now .
I really enjoyed collaborating with him .
And I especially liked writing with The-Dream , basically because we both love having fun with lyrics and melodies , and we 're also capable of getting more serious on deeper songs .
There is a particular sense of freedom I feel when we write together -- even though I make him stay in the studio all night until he is ready to kill me !
LOL ! ''
On this song Carey threatens to out a cheating lover on national television .
The song 's subject matter of revenge is a topic Carey has rarely tackled before .
