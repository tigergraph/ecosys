Leonard Cohen digs out his acoustic guitar for this Country-Folk ballad .
It is one of three tracks on Old Ideas to feature his finger picking .
The song is an ode to a fading love .
`` I 'm old and the mirrors do n't lie , '' Cohen croons .
The 77-year-old songwriter-poet penned the tune with Anhani Thomas , who has been his long-term girlfriend keyboardist and backup vocalist .
She originally recorded it the tune on her 2006 album Blue Alert .
Cohen explained during a press preview of Old Ideas in London -LRB- as reported by The Sun -RRB- : `` It 's quite a different treatment but I always loved that song and I asked her to reduce it to guitar chords that I could master .
Her piano is so much more subtle and the chords are so much more sophisticated than the ones I could finger on my guitar .
So she reduced it to chords that she knew I could play .
We rehearsed it for a while and then did it in one take . ''
