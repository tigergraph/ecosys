This is the closing track from The Chaos , the fourth album by Northern English post-punk revival band The Futureheads .
Guitarist Ross Millard explained to Spinner UK that the song sums up the principal theme of the record concerning the effects of the economic downturn in Northern England .
`` That one begins with this big sort of a cappella section where all four of us are singing different harmonies at the same time .
It 's kind of a bit Queen and a bit pompous , a little bit operatic almost , '' he said , laughing .
`` It 's that sort of someone knowing no limitations and no boundaries and being ambitious with whatever they 're doing .
That 's the sort of emphasis of that song and it 's also the emphasis of the record : do n't get boxed in , do n't get trodden down , rally together and be optimistically positive in the face of what might seem like quite a scary or menacing time . ''
