This is the first single from Finnish symphonic metal band Apocalyptica 's seventh studio album , which is appropriately titled 7th Symphony .
It is one of four tracks with vocals on the set , the others being entirely instrumental .
The song features Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale wailing about his misery as a result of a failed relationship .
Apocalyptica member Eicca Toppinen told The Pulse of Radio about selecting the right singer to fit the track 's style .
`` This time we had loads of songs and we were always like , ` Okay , who could we get to nail this song down in the right way ? '
But the song itself , I think , is pretty much straight kind of , it 's more like Foo Fighters-ish style than really a metal song .
It 's a really catchy and cool song . ''
