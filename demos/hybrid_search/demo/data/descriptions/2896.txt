This song references other songs in lyrics .
It seems to be a jab at Trent Reznor with of references to Nine Inch Nails songs `` Perfect Drug '' and `` Closer . ''
The bridge of , `` You ca n't bring me down '' is borrowed from the song of that name by Suicidal Tendencies .
The guitar part playing tips its hat to the Suicidal Tendencies song also .
Speaking to NME in 2012 , guitarist Wes Borland recalled how he and vocalist Fred Durst came up with the album title .
`` I was looking at different bottles of flavored water and joked that they should make water flavored like hot dogs .
It was late at night and we were delirious .
Then Fred said , ` What if the band is The Hot Dog Flavored Water and the frontman is some a -- hole called Chocolate Starfish ?
I said ` Perfect . ' ''
