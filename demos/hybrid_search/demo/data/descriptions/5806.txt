This is the title track from the seventh studio album by the Arizona-based rock band Jimmy Eat World .
The song finds vocalist Jim Adkins singing about someone who is deeply in love but is struggling to express it in quite the right way .
Lead singer Jim Adkins explained in a track-by track on the Friends or Enemies site that this song refers to , `` A person who is playing off their lack of success by defining themselves as the perpetual underdog . ''
He added that the song `` Cut , '' is `` in a way the female perspective of the male perspective of ` Invented ' the song . ''
Adkins told MTV News he got his creative juices flowing by sampling the work of contemporary photographers Hannah Starkey and Cindy Sherman .
`` I started flipping through their photography books , and the work I was going through was based on one central figure or maybe a small group .
It 's composed things , there 's a cinematic look to it , there 's a scene , but nothing is explained for you , '' he explained .
`` So what I would do was take a little bit of time and kind of just free-write about any aspect that came to mind about it .
You know , like , who these people are , what decisions they might be making in that moment , who are the people they might be looking at off camera.The idea was n't to get material for Jimmy Eat World songs , it was just to get your brain working , '' he continued .
`` But then , as we would go on and work on our own material , some of the more interesting ideas from those sessions started creeping in to those songs , and after a while , there was enough of those ideas that became songs that the rest of the band was really liking , and that kind of became the majority of the record .
