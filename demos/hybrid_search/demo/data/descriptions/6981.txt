This is partly about the terror attacks on New York , and Corgan 's feelings about if this would happen to his hometown of Chicago .
Corgan performed this song live on The David Letterman Show in 2005 .
Corgan looks kind of sad and distanced from everything during the performance .
He had just gotten some very bad news just before they were supposed to go on , and decided to play this instead of `` A100 , '' which they were going to play .
-LRB- thanks , SJ - skalj , Denmark , for all above -RRB- `` M.O.H. '' is the song 's working title -LRB- My Old Heart -RRB- , although the title changed as the song progressed .
