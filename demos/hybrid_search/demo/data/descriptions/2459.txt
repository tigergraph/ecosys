MSN Music asked Zombie who it is that 's talking at the beginning of this track .
He replied : `` It 's a bunch of old science fiction writers being interviewed in the early '70s , talking about their theories on things , and we had 'em all playing at once , talking over each other so it just became gibberish . ''
The song shares the same title with one written by infamous mass murder Charles Manson .
Zombie explained to MSN Music : `` I just always liked that title , ` Cease to Exist . '
If I 'm not mistaken , the Beach Boys did a cover of that song -LSB- check it out here -RSB- , but they changed the title .
I always thought , ` Damn , why 'd they change the title ?
That was the best thing about it . '
So if they did n't want the title , I 'll use it . ''
