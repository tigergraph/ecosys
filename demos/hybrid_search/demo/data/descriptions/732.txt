Annie Lennox explained this song in a blog promoting her 2009 greatest hits album : `` It is a very personal , sweet song .
I lost my first baby , and when you lose a child you have to carry on in life without them being a continuing part of it .
It changes the entire way you see everything .
Further on down the line , my daughter was safely brought into the world , and I wrote this song for her , because I was just so profoundly grateful for her existence .
Now I have two daughters , and the dedication extends to both my girls , so now the title is plural because I love them both equally with the passion of a mother . ''
