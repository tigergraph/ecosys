Conor Oberst wrote the song in memory of Sabrina Duim , a harpist who 'd toured with his band Bright Eyes in the past .
She died in January of 2007 .
`` Breezy '' was her nickname .
The song appeared on Sabrina Duim 's memorial website .
Breezy released on Oberst 's 2008 Gentleman 's Pact EP .
The record was sold exclusively at concerts on his 2008 tour , and was limited to 1000 vinyls and 1000 cds .
It features two songs written before his Conor Oberst record and two songs , including Breezy , written after .
The Mystic Valley Band serves as his backing act on the EP .
The lyrics are a series of powerful , allusive sentiments voiced from Oberst to , presumably , Duim .
These range from bittersweet and direct -LRB- `` I love you , I know that 's all that matters '' -RRB- to personally allusive -LRB- `` Tried to teach me about baseball , my favorite part was when they made it home '' -RRB- .
It 's a stripped down acoustic number , just Oberst , his guitar , and sorrowful memories of a dear friend who 's passed away .
