Before the writing process for In the Belly of the Brazen Bull began , The Cribs were hit hard by the news that a fan they had met had taken his own life .
This song was the eventual result .
`` We were supposed to go to Coachella , but we got grounded because of the volcano ash , '' bassist Gary Jarman recalled to NME : `` I wrote this acoustic song , then found out one of our fans had committed suicide .
The band meant a lot to him , and I 'd met him outside the Corn Exchange in Edinburgh .
When someone cares about what you do , you have this real degree of responsibility . ''
