Gallows vocalist Frank Carter explained this song to Kerrang !
magazine April 18 , 2009 : `` This track is about priests , the clergy , holy men and holy women and people that claim that title for themselves .
I despise religious fanatics and people who claim that they are a closer link to a higher being .
They suck all the life out of people .
They 're scaremongers , they claim they preach the good word - but you go read the Book of Revelations , and you 'll see it has very little good word -LRB- sic -RRB- in it . ''
