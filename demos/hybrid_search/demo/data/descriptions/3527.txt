This is the second single from American dance pop act Selena Gomez & The Scene 's debut album , Kiss & Tell .
The song is about a guy who is the perfect fit for the band 's 17-year-old singer , Wizards of Waverly Place star , Selena Gomez .
Selena told Digital Spy about `` Naturally '' : `` It 's just a feelgood song .
It 's fun , light and poppy .
Basically it 's about two people who have a connection with each other so they do n't really have to force the feelings - they 're just there .
I think it 's a good representation of the album because it 's very energetic , lively and not too serious . ''
Gomez told MTV News about the song 's music video : `` The video is very different from any other video that I 've done .
It has a lot more fierce clothes and a lot of fun colors . ''
The song topped the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart , long before Gomez was old enough to step in a club .
`` I remember when ` Naturally ' came out , I was 16 or 17 and it went # 1 on Billboard 's club charts and I died laughing 'cause I was 16 and I had never even been in a club and my song was doing great in the club , '' she laughed to MTV News in 2013 .
`` It 's like , ` awesome . ' ''
