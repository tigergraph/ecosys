This song came out of nowhere one hot summer night in Melbourne .
Airbourne frontman Joel O'Keeffe recalled to AntiMusic : `` Just messing around on the guitar drinking some Jack Daniels Single Barrel ... came up with the verse riff and chorus riff then went outside for a cigarette and looked up at the full moon and then ` I 'm a Hellraiser ... ' came , which lead onto ` you got ta live it up ' and so forth .
`` Went back inside and started forming the guts of it , '' he continued , `` then the next day we went into the jam room put it together and recorded a demo of it , then Ryan and I worked on lyrics some more , we showed Brian Howes -LRB- Producer -RRB- then we put it through pre-production and recorded it for the album .
Then we worked on the intro with Brian and Jay adding in the Air raid sirens , Bombers , Spitfires and Dive bombers and the big Bomb .
The inspiration came from a month long booze binge of wild crazy nights in Melbourne that month ... good times ! ''
The song was released as the first single from Black Dog Barking on March 25 , 2013 .
