Perhaps Mann 's most depressing song , `` Wise Up '' deals with the need to recognize reality .
Its lyrics , `` It 's not going to stop till you wise up , so you might as well give up , '' are not of the encouraging , positive , motivational nature .
This is in contrast to the song 's sweet melody and gentle , orchestral swells .
This song was featured prominently in the Paul Thomas Anderson movie Magnolia in a surreal sequence wherein several characters in different locations are seen simultaneously singing the tune aloud .
The film itself was basically a story created around Mann 's songs .
The singer/songwriter explained to dcist what happened : `` Well , I wrote it for Jerry Maguire .
-LSB- Writer/director Cameron Crowe -RSB- really liked the demo , and then he did n't like the finished version , so he did n't put it in the movie .
Then after the movie came out , he called me and said , ' I do n't know what I was thinking !
Your version is awesome .
I guess I was just kind of attached to the demo . '
So he put it on the soundtrack album .
So it 's there , and on the DVD , but it was n't in the original release of the film .
And then Paul Thomas Anderson heard it , and he really liked it .
So -LSB- the song 's prominent use in Magnolia -RSB- was kind of a sweet shout-out . ''
