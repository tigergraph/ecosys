The Arctic Monkeys have a formula for creating their tunes , which includes making the sound and then penning the lyrics afterwards .
Vocalist Alex Turner told NME about the creation of this song : `` It was quite early on , that one , '' he said .
`` We were messing around with this four-track cassette recorder , and he -LRB- Jamie Cook -RRB- was playing this riff , so we recorded five minutes of that and I wrote melodies and lyrics over the top .
That became a formula , almost - we recorded instrumentals on this four-track and then I 'd sit with my headphones on and write . ''
This borrows backing vocals from Marvin Gaye 's '' ` Sexual Healing . ''
The song was debuted by the band on the UK XFM radio station on September 2 , 2013 .
