This song is about destruction of all life on Earth through nuclear weapons and the horrible aftermath .
The line , `` Einstein said ` We 'll use rocks on the other side ' , '' refers to the Einstein quote , `` The next World War will be fought with stones , '' meaning , that nuclear weapons would bomb the world back to the stone age .
The line , `` The arsenal of Megadeth ca n't be rid of , '' comes from a pamphlet by California Senator Alan Cranston which reads , `` The arsenal of megadeath ca n't be rid no matter what the peace treaties come to . ''
Dave Mustaine started writing this song on his trip home after being fired from Metallica while they were recording in New York .
Mustaine says he found the pamphlet with the `` megadeath '' quote in a Greyhound terminal , and started writing lyrics on food wrappers and whatever else he could find .
The introduction comes from is a song by The Ink Spots called `` I Do n't Want To Set The World On Fire . ''
