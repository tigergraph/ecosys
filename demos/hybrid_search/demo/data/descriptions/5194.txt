Alternative Country artist Steve Earle plays a street musician on HBO 's New Orleans based show Treme , which is set in the aftermath of the 2005 floods that caused devastating damage in the Louisiana city .
During the filming of the second season , a drilling rig exploded in the Gulf Mexico causing the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry .
The spill caused extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats as well as the Gulf 's fishing and tourism industries .
This ballad was inspired by the incident .
Earle recalled to Spinner : `` We were at the end of the season , we were all feeling pretty good , and pretty good about ourselves .
We were all patting ourselves on the back because the locals seemed to like the show and we liked the show , we liked what we had been working on.Then at the very end of it , when we were filming episode eight or nine , the spill happens .
You could watch folks that lived here that were really starting to feel good about themselves and about the city , and it put this big huge question mark about ` What 's going to happen to us now ?
What more can happen ? ' ''
I 'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive takes its name from Hank Williams ' posthumous 1953 hit - it was the last tune the country legend recorded before he died .
Earle 's debut novel also uses the same title .
Earle said that the song came from a place of both solidarity and anger .
He told Spinner : `` People around here want the drilling again to start immediately , and it 's sort of telling the story of people that are dependent in it .
I believe that they 're being had , that they 're being lied to , but I do understand .
It 's about the hope that those people might get jobs , and they just do n't want that hope taken out of their lives . ''
