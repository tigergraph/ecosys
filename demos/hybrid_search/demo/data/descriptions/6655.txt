Frontman Cormac Neeson -LRB- from Kerrang !
February 21 , 2009 -RRB- : `` The lyrics are based loosely on a friend of mine that committed suicide back in my school days .
In the chorus of the song I 'm just trying to understand what goes through a person 's mind and why they should take their own life .
The night we finished recording it , we were listening back to the bare bones rough mix drinking tequilas and saying that this was a really powerful f -- king song . ''
