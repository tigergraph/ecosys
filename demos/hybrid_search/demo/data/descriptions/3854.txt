This number is a look at what would happen if nothing ever went wrong again .
Jennifer Nettles commented on the duo 's website : `` If life stayed the way it was , if those conditions were n't in our lives , then this would literally be the last Country song . ''
The impetus and inspiration behind this song came from when Owens told the duo that someone had once asked him why country music was always so sad .
Owens ' answer was that if bad things never happened , then what would we have to write about ?
This was written by Nettles and Bush together with Tim Owens , who also has a writing credit on Sugarland 's 2007 hit `` Settlin . ''
