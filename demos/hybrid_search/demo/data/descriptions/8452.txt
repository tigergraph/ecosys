Singer Anthony Raneri is involved in writing almost all of Bayside 's songs , but `` Winter '' is notable for being written without any of the other band members .
The song is a great showcase for Raneri 's lyrical style , which typically goes for direct , hard images that evoke strong feelings in the listener.The song was written as a response to a tragic 2005 traffic accident that resulted in the death of the band 's drummer , John `` Beatz '' Holohan .
On the last night of the band 's acoustic tour which followed the accident , Raneri sat alone in a diner to reflect on the drummer 's death .
Over the course of seven early morning hours , he wrote the song and immediately after walked to the studio and recorded it .
This stripped down performance was the lead track on the band 's subsequent EP , Acoustic , and is dedicated to Holohan .
Raneri describes the song as a `` closing of a book for the band , '' and it has never been performed live.Lyrically , the song explores the dissociation experienced by Raneri in the wake of Holohan 's death , as well as the newfound appreciation he felt for all of his close friends following the accident .
`` Winter '' never directly mentions Holohan , instead referencing him in only indirectly - as an angel , as an absence , as a true friend who 's moved on .
The band has only performed the song once , live or otherwise .
This is the acoustic studio version that was officially released .
The album that `` Winter '' appears on , Bayside Acoustic , was released two months after the accident and features a stripped down Bayside playing without a drummer , as Holohan would not be replaced until the following year .
The album also shipped with a DVD montage of the deceased bandmate .
