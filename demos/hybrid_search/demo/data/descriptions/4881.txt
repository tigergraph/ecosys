Part of Aretha Franklin 's legendary album I Never Loved A Man The Way I Loved You , the composer credit on this song goes to Franklin with her sister -LRB- and backup singer -RRB- Carolyn and sax player King Curtis .
The song , however , is basically a rewrite of the 1966 track `` Help Me '' by the R&B singer Ray Sharpe , who wrote the song with Curtis and performed it with the King Curtis Orchestra .
Also on that original recording : Jimi Hendrix , who played guitar in Sharpe 's band .
That 's King Curtis playing the tenor saxophone on this song .
Curtis performed with Aretha at many of her shows and assisted Wexler on production duties for the album .
He died in 1971 at age 37 after he was attacked by a man who stabbed him .
Aretha was 24 years old when Jerry Wexler signed her away from Capitol Records and brought her to Atlantic , where he gave her a great deal of creative freedom and a talented engineer in Tom Dowd.The Franklin sisters ' Gospel roots are apparent on this track , where Aretha sings about a love gone wrong .
She was married at the time , but had no problem conjuring up a convincing song of heartache .
The British electronic group OMD sampled this song in a mashup with their 1980 track `` Messages '' to create a new version of `` Save Me '' for their 2010 album History of Modern .
When we asked Andy McCluskey of OMD about this creation , he told us : `` To be honest , I was not a real soul fan growing up .
I loved pop then .
Synths .
Only when I got older did I learn to appreciate other styles .
Aretha is , without a doubt , the queen of soul singers . ''
