Olly penned this song with Wayne Hector , who has written hits for the likes of Westlife and JLS as well as the singer 's `` Thinking Of Me '' single .
Speaking with The Daily Star , Murs explained the message behind the tune : `` It 's about my fans , '' he said , `` that we are together - is nice .
It 's a bit cheesy to write a song about you and your fans but you could interpret it as a relationship , marching to the future together .
`` He added : `` But it was written as me speaking to them saying to grow with me and we can keep going . ''
The track was produced by the production pair of Future Cut who have worked with a wide-ranging range of artists including singer-songwriter Lily Allen , urban pop trio Stooshe , rapper Professor Green and veteran crooner Tom Jones .
According to Darren Lewis of the duo , the key to their success in crossing genres is to be able to maximise an artist 's potential while allowing them to maintain their individuality .
