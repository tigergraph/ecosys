The lyrics , in particular the opening line , refer to an incident the band experienced at a 2004 performance .
Lead vocalist Craig Nicholls suffered a breakdown during the show , and accidentally punched a fan , not realizing it until it was too late .
Later , the assault charges against Nicholls were dropped after it was discovered he has Asperger syndrome , a disorder on the autism spectrum .
The disorder , along with the stresses of performing , is what caused the breakdown .
