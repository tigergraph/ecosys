Guitarist Hugo White penned this track with vocalist Orlando Weeks .
White explained to NME : `` I 'd written a song which was very different .
We kept most of the original lyrics , but ` Land wrote a middle section that pulls it all together .
It 's about friends , really . ''
Rather than writing songs about sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll for Given To The Wild , most of the tracks celebrate family and friends .
Frontman Orlando Weeks explained why to Q magazine : `` We 've got to that age now where friends are starting to have babies and get on with their lives .
I 'm 28 now and it feels like the tipping point when these major things start to happen .
That 's crept into the lyrics . ''
