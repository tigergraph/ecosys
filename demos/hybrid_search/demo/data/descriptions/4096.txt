The Ting Tings are an English Indie Pop duo , consisting of multi-instrumentalist Jules de Martino and vocalist Katie White .
This is a track from their second album .
Sounds From Nowheresville .
Much of the record was written on the road , on the duo 's phones .
`` When we 're apart , Katie will have an idea , record it , and then audio-text it to me , '' de Martino told Spin magazine .
The Guggenheim is a museum of modern art , located in Bilbao , Spain .
Designed by Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry , it is one of the most admired works of contemporary architecture .
Apart from this song , the only music link we can think of is that part of the video for the 1998 Jermaine Dupri and Mariah Carey duet `` Sweetheart '' was filmed there .
This song 's chorus is about making up your face like a museum .
White cooked it up in the back of a cab after a few drinks , whilst in Ibiza .
White told Spinner the song was partially inspired by a `` massive row '' that she had over the phone on a mountain in Ibiza .
De Martino had secretly recorded her shouting down the line then played back to her , saying , `` Listen , it 's like spoken word , it 's amazing . ''
