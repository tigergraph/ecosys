Antwerpen or Antwerp is the largest town in Flanders , the Flemish-speaking part of Belgium .
It is situated on the River Schelde .
Singer Rou Reynolds explained to Kerrang !
May 2 , 2009 : `` We played there last year .
We caught a cab with this driver who was a total character .
He told us a story about his city in a really hard to decipher accent , so I started to record him with my phone .
In Flemish , ant means hand , and twerpen means to throw .
A giant used to charge a toll for people to cross the river Schelde .
If you could n't pay the toll , he 'd chop your hand off and throw it in the river .
The story is that a Roman soldier fought the giant and won , cut his hand off and threw it in the water .
It 's a good metaphor for positive aggression , taking down the giants . ''
