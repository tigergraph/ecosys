After a seventeen year relationship with Interscope , Limp Bizkit parted company with the record label and signed with Cash Money Records on February 24 , 2012 .
This was the first song to be released by their new partnership with the Hip-Hop label .
Limp Bizkit did n't intend to record a single when they started jamming with Lil Wayne and producer Polow da Don .
Fred Durst told Artist Direct : `` It somehow magically lined up to have a meaning with some legs to it .
I do n't know how it happened .
Making the song with Polow da Don , we had this vibe .
I realized that as rare as our style , music , and feeling was when it came out , it 's even rarer now .
That 's pretty weird and exciting .
This feeling and music is so rare . ''
Frontman Fred Durst met up with his new labelmate Lil Wayne in Miami after the 2012 Grammys to record this tune and the song finds the pair trading verses .
Durst said of the track to Billboard magazine : `` It sounds like a monster ; it literally sounds dangerous .
It sounds like that left of center , that place of discomfort that created rock 'n' roll , created the -LSB- heavy -RSB- metal , where it all spawned from . ''
