This was released as the debut single by the American Gospel-Rock recording artist Colton Dixon .
He said of the song : `` I think there 's something powerful in knowing God is what we ca n't be and he 's everything we 're not .
It encourages me , because whenever I fall I know God will be there to pick me up and I think that is something people need to hear .
God is what I want to sing about , he is the air that surrounds me and the hope I need . ''
A Messenger is a faith-based album .
Dixon explained to Billboard magazine that pursuing the Christian rock path was a natural choice for him .
`` I 've been listening to Christian music since I was little .
I grew up with it , '' he said .
Dixon added that he loves music with a message and is therefore drawn to Christian rock tunes .
`` I 'm very happy that I was excepted well into that market .
You never know ... being an ` Idol ' and going into Christian music - I 've seen it work and I 've seen it not work .
I 'm happy that it did . ''
