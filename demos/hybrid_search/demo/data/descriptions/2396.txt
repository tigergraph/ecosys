In our interview with Laura Bell Bundy , she explained : `` Jeff came in with something about , ' I never needed to be the homecoming queen . '
He brought it to me going , ' I know you 're gon na love this song .
This reminds me of you in some kind of way , you never needed to be this . '
And I was like , ` Not that I did n't want to . '

So we started to switch it around - it was very mutual .
