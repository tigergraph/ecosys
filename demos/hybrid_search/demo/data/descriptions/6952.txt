This love ballad was originally released in its early stages of development as a demo on 2004 's Ultimate Collection .
It was a song that Michael especially loved and it was finished in Los Angeles by former Ne-Yo producer Theron `` Neff-U '' Feemster and included on Jackson 's first posthumous album , Michael .
`` It 's a song he had in his heart for many years , '' said Feemster to Billboard magazine .
`` I 'm glad he trusted me enough to complete his vision . ''
