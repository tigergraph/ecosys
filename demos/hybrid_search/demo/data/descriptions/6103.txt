This is a track from Commitment , the seventh studio album by Seal .
The British singer-songwriter wrote the song with songwriter , arranger and producer Peter-John Vettese , Gus Isidore and Marcus Brown .
The Reuters interviewer asked , given the commitment theme of the album , why Seal included this song about dishonesty .
He replied : `` I drew upon past life experiences that are not necessarily a part of my life now .
But it certainly prepared me for my life right now .
So therefore , it 's an integral part of my life now . ''
Seal explained the album title to Reuters : `` Commitment is the recurring theme that kept popping up .
Certainly the last seven years of my life since I met my wife -LRB- Heidi Klum -RRB- have been extremely committed .
But not just in our personal life .
My work has a level of commitment to it .
The team around me consists of people who are committed . ''
