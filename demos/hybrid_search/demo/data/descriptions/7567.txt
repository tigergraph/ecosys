Guitarist Will Nutter told The Alternative Press : `` At some point , I think everyone has been misled one way or another .
This song is about being in love , feeling like you 're with the only person who understands you , but unfortunately the feelings are n't mutual .
It 's realizing that sometimes letting go of the people you love is best for the situation . ''
