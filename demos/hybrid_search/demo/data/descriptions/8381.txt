Fairport , New York native Julia Nunes started writing songs at the age of 13 when she was in a Ska band .
The Portuguese-American troubadour became well known for her videos of both original songs and covers on YouTube in which she sings harmony with herself and plays acoustic instruments .
Nunes opened four times for one of her idols , Ben Folds , in May 2008 at the piano player 's request after she posted one of her covers of his songs on the net .
She made her television debut on January 24 , 2012 performing this song on Conan .
Nunes told American Songwriter why she is especially proud of this song .
She explained that it is , `` my anthem for all the people who stay up late for absolutely no reason , but during the hours of 1:00 am and 5:00 am everything they 're doing seems really important .
If California Girls and American Idiots get anthems , voluntary insomniacs should too .
So I 'm especially proud to have written one . ''
