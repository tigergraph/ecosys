After becoming an extensive club hit in North America in 2008 , this song crossed the Atlantic to become a chart hit in the UK in 2009 .
Deadmau5 told HousePlanet.DJ that this was originally an older track that he re-visited .
He explained that it `` was based on a track that I never released called ' I Forget . ' ''
Deadmau5 added : `` It had been more of a cinematic segue-type thing , not dance music at all , which is something that I 'll throw together every month -- just some 50 second long thing .
So I went back to that track and realized that if we expanded it , and added a vocal it might work . ''
