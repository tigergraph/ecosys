Nick Lowe told The Huffington Post that this song is about retreating from reality with the help of a good book : `` I actually can not remember writing this song .
I remember working at it very hard and being in a trance very hard for a few weeks , and then suddenly , I came out of it with a song .
I do n't really know why somebody has n't done this before because it 's such an obvious idea .
In fact , I 'm sure someone has done it before because everything has been done before .
It 's very simple , and it 's about somebody who is very , very blue , and all they can do it stick their head in a book and try to escape from whatever terrible case of the blues that they 've got , until some sort of recovery takes place . ''
The Old Magic was Lowe 's thirteenth solo album .
Lowe told KLRU that much of the album 's material was influenced by old music standards : `` There 's no doubt I 'm very drawn to that classic songwriting style .
It is nice when it comes along .
It feels like it has been around for a great while . ''
Lowe revealed to Interview magazine that he does indeed read a lot : `` I suppose I do .
I ca n't really read much when I 'm at home , because I 've got a very young little boy .
Every time I try to pick up a book he comes and bugs me about something or other .
The only time I can really read a book is when I 'm on the road .
Yeah , of course I like to read . ''
