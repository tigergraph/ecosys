This was the first song from American lo-fi punkers Vivian Girls third album , Share The Joy to be made available .
The band shared the song on February 4th , 2011 by means of the online record label RCRD LBL , which offers all of its music for free via Mp3 downloads .
Singer-guitarist Cassie Ramone explained the album title to Spin magazine : `` It 's actually a good story .
So , Burt Bacharach and his lyricist Hal David are two of my absolute heroes .
Together they are probably the best songwriting team of all time .
Burt Bacharach 's melodies and arrangements have really inspired me , as have Hal David 's lyrics .
They did a lot of soundtrack work in the 1960s , and soon worked on this movie called Lost Horizon .
It was supposed to be this huge box office smash and all this money was thrown at it .
But it was a commercial disaster .
All the tensions that surrounded the process of writing the music ended with Burt Bacharach and Hal David not working together anymore .
Both their careers became disasters .
One song from the movie 's soundtrack is called ` Share the Joy , ' which is one of the most beautiful songs ever written .
It 's so haunting .
I love the fact that it 's called ` Share the Joy , ' but it does n't sound joyous at all .
When you listen to it , it 's like there 's a ghost in the room . ''
