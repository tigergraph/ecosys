This tribute to legendary session bass guitarist Carol Kaye is a track from American singer-songwriter Laura Veirs ' seventh studio album , July Flames .
Carol Kaye is one of the most prolific and widely heard bass guitarists in history , having played on an estimated 10,000 recording sessions .
Her credits include Ritchie Valens ' `` La Bamba , '' several Beach Boys hits including `` Good Vibrations , '' and Simon & Garfunkel 's `` Homeward Bound . ''
She has also contributed to many film scores by Quincy Jones and Lalo Schifrin .
The song is one of several on the album on which My Morning Jacket 's Jim James contributes falsetto harmonies .
The collaboration came about as a result of Veirs ' long-time producer and current beau Tucker Martine 's friendship with James .
She explained in an interview with the January 2010 edition of Uncut magazine ; `` Tucker worked with Jim on The Decemberists album and they became fast friends .
They have a similar sense of humor , and both grew up listening to '80s Southern Rock .
`` Veirs added : `` It 's amazing to be around someone who has that much control over their voice-high , beautiful tones that are very pure , almost like a flute or like harmonics . ''
