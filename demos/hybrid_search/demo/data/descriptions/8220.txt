This cowbell-infused jam features Peter Moren singing lead .
However , the song evolved from a lyrical and melodic idea of bassist Bjorn Yttling .
`` It 's about someone living in the past , not wanting to get rid of his excessive baggage , always sticking with his usual ways and not realizing that the glory days are over , '' explained Moren to Spin magazine .
`` Everyone writes lyrics in this band , then we all fix the song up together .
If one guy writes the melody , then another writes the riff or drums .
We swap instruments .
There 's no leader in this band . ''
Instrumental parts of this song are used as the opening theme and incidental music for the American TV show 2 Broke Girls .
The show is a fast-paced sitcom where they try to cram a lot of jokes into their 22 1/2 minutes , so the intro is only about 10 seconds long and the music coming in and out of commercials is also quick to allow more dialogue .
The song works perfectly for the show because it is so identifiable in short , instrumental bursts .
