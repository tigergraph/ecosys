This song could be about the pressure people go through when they are being bullied at school and otherwise tormented .
It is more evident in the chorus itself : `` Do n't go hot in the shade '' means do n't wander around in places where you could get teased or bullied .
In other words , the `` Shade '' could mean places where popular kids hand out and is therefore the hardest place to handle in terms with joining in and trying to be friends .
This is also probably the place that will attract the most attention , this could be places like , school oval , or wherever you think these kids hang out .
