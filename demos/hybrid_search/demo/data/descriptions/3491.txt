Frontman Johnny Borrell told Q magazine that this song was inspired by a friend of his .
He explained : `` One went on a three-day bender and ended up reading about it in the tabloids . ''
Borrell expanded on this song to The Daily Record October 24 , 2008 : `` The song was about those professional celebrities , people who start to become famous for going to parties .
It 's a self-regarding thing .
These people go to parties so they can get into the paper , then sit and look at pictures the next morning to see how they looked compared to everyone else .
I ca n't understand how people can live their life like that .
It 's not a real world .
You can see people getting sucked into it , they start to believe that reality .
You can go to a nightclub in London and walk out and a load of cameras will pop at you , but what that has to do with life I have no idea .
It screws people up .
It was inspired by that .
It 's a song I have been thinking about writing for a long time , going right back to the first record , and it has finally materialized . ''
