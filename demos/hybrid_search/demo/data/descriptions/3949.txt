Counting Crows lead singer Adam Duritz said of this song : `` My last girlfriend , for the first month and a half that we were going out , her mother was living with her , and her mother 's very Catholic .
We could n't spend the night together , so I was constantly making these drives in the middle of the night - very surreal , four in the morning , falling asleep .
I really believed in the relationship , but when I was writing this song , the lyrics came out : ` Pretty soon I wo n't come around . '
It was n't what I wanted - I did n't want it to end - but there it was .
It 's about the inevitability of leaving . ''
