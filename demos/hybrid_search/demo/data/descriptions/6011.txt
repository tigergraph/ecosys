it was intended for Led Zeppelin 4 , but was put on Physical Graffiti to fill the double album .
This song is about a man dodging a military draft , according to Robert Plant .
Despite the title , it has nothing in common with : The album by Moody Blues , the 1933 Clark Gable film , the novel by Antoine de Saint Exupery , or the groundbreaking , classic , 1980s , USA network TV series Night Flight , which we will never shut up raving about because it is just that many tons of awesome .
While there 's no official live recording of the band playing this , bootlegs abound of one time when they did it during a sound check on stage .
A different studio version was produced with extra backing vocals .
In Frank Moriarty 's book Seventies Rock : The Decade of Creative Chaos , Moriarty recounts how critics were less receptive to Zeppelin 's stateside invasion than their fans : `` The writers insisted the band 's concerts did little more than placate legions of Quaalude-swallowing , whiskey-and-wine-swilling cretins , a vulgar audience that filled the soulless hockey rinks and municipal auditoriums of the United States - and Led Zeppelin was more to be blamed for the group 's low-rent audiences than praised for their music . ''
Good thing their reputation recovered , then !
Most of this song was written by Led Zeppelin 's bass player , John Paul Jones , who is listed first on the writing credits .
It is one of the few Led Zeppelin songs with no guitar solo .
In the liner notes for the Led Zeppelin box set , Jimmy Page declares : `` To be able to fuse all these styles was always my dream in the early stages , but now the composing side of it is just as important . ''
