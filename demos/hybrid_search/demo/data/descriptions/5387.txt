James Brown scored the soundtrack for the blaxploitation flick Black Caesar in 1973 and wrote this and other songs for the sequel Hell Up in Harlem .
Director Larry Cohen , however , did n't like any of the music Brown recorded and rejected it all .
He hired Motown 's Edwin Starr to replace him , but Brown was n't about to let his work go to waste .
The majority of the nixed soundtrack became his 1973 album The Payback , but this song ended up on his following album , Hell .
Janet Jackson sampled this song in her 1993 chart-topper `` That 's The Way Love Goes . ''
The full-length version of this song runs nearly 14 minutes and includes a piano solo by Brown , but an edited version was also released as a two-part single .
Although it was snubbed for the Hell Up in Harlem score , this song has made the cut for several other soundtracks , including Spike Lee 's Get on the Bus -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , The Woodsman -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , Twisted -LRB- 2004 -RRB- and Guess Who -LRB- 2005 -RRB- .
