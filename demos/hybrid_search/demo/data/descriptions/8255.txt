The first single from Mumford & Sons ' second album Babel is a rollicking stomp that finds Marcus Mumford singing about the challenges of maintaining a relationship amidst the conflicts of life on the road .
It is one of several tracks on the set inspired by the band 's busy touring schedule .
`` We write on the road in these hectic places with lots of people around , '' Mumford explained to MTV News .
`` And I suppose we 've always put in ideas that we pick up from conversations with people , and things that we read and things that we listen to and feel . ''
Mumford & Sons performed this song at the 2013 Grammy Awards , where Babel won for Album Of The Year .
The rousing Bluegrass tune is lushly arrayed with horns , bright banjo , stomping drums and fiddle .
It reflects the influence of the Nashville sessions the band took part in during early 2011 in a farmhouse when , as Marcus Mumford told MTV News , they `` had some friends who are musicians come play with us . ''
