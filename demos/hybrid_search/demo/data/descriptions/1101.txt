This is about a battle with Saturn ascending and teaching us lessons over and over again until we get it right .
`` Saturn ascends , choose one or ten .
Hang on or be humbled again '' means get it right or Saturn will come around again teaching the same lesson until you do it .
`` The one the ten '' could be the Aries and Capricorn houses in the zodiac -LRB- Capricorn is ruled by Saturn -RRB- .
A lot of what Maynard Keenan is saying relates to characteristics of a Capricorn .
They are known to hold grudges and be control freaks .
Maynard is an Aries , the true pioneer of the zodiac .
It could be a message for all the caps and people out there who hold grudges .
-LRB- thanks , donna - chicago , IL -RRB- The line , `` Unable To Forgive Your Scarlet Lettermen '' presumably refers to the classic novel The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne .
One of the main characters in the book is a female adulteress who is forced to wear a scarlet letter ` A ' on her breast as punishment .
