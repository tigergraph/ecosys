The second single from Fantasia 's Side Effects Of You album finds her hooking up with singer Kelly Rowland and rapper Missy Elliott .
Fantasia and Missy penned the song with Al Sherrod Lambert , Kyle Stewart and Harmony Samuels with the latter also producing the tune .
This was one of six songs on The Side Effects Of You that Fantasia co-wrote .
She told CBS : `` They allowed me to write ... I always wanted to do something different .
I love R&B but for the level I 'm at now , I wanted to do something like Rock-Soul .
When you hear Rock Soul , you think of Tina Turner .
You think of James Brown .
I wanted so bad to do something like that . ''
Fantasia 's inspiration for the song originally came from a late night phone call she had in the studio , which left her fuming .
She recalled to You Know I Got Soul : `` I remember coming back into the studio and I said , ` Harmony I need you give me some hood . '
I took Al Sherrod 's hat .
He 's another artist who worked with me .
He 's a writer and producer .
Shout out to Al Sherrod .
I took his hat and I was like ` let 's get in the boot . '
I got in there and came up with ` Really gon ' make me expose you for exactly what you are . '
That was my way of getting that rage and anger out and put it on the record . ''
