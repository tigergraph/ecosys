Katy wrote this song about an ex who broke her heart .
She told The Sun : '' ` Go Away ' is about one person , though I 've never asked him if he knows it 's about him .
That would be terrifying .
It 's hard enough to put it out there how you are feeling without them knowing , but I guess I ca n't hide all the time . ''
