Zappa shot a highly surreal , low-budget video for this song , which was shown on MTV extremely rarely .
For one thing , the video depicted a Ronald Reagan-lookalike -LRB- Reagan was then President of the US -RRB- sitting in a device resembling an electric chair ; for another , the song itself contained an ethnic slur and strong racial themes .
-LRB- These facts did not stop the video from resurfacing nearly 15 years later on MTV 's show Beavis and Butthead . -RRB-
-LRB- thanks , Matt - Voorhees , NJ -RRB-
