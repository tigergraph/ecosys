This Mark Knopfler composition is an ode to Sir Francis Chichester -LRB- 1901-72 -RRB- , whose greatest achievement was to sail single-handedly around the world from West to East , becoming the first person to make a true circumnavigation .
Setting off from Plymouth on August 27 , 1966 , he returned to the same port on May 28 the next year .
After Chichester 's death , his boat , Gipsy Moth IV , was moored at Greenwich next to the Cutty Sark , the world famous clipper ship that was moored there on public display in 1954 .
See Chichester in Song Images .
`` Single-Handed Sailor , '' which runs to 4 minutes 42 seconds , refers to the wind wailing round the Cutty Sark ; in the early days , the band used to rehearse at a studio in Greenwich , which was probably what first inspired the song .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 2 -RRB-
