The Gin Blossoms ' Jesse Valenzuela says , `` There 's some songs I 'm very attached to , and some songs it 's sort of a business . ''
And this song is an example of one the songwriter feels is special for him .
He explains , `` I got to a really nice groove , and I got the band to groove in a way they 've never played before together .
I mean , individually everybody 's gone on to do lots of different things in different fashions .
But for us it 's always been about really sort of fast up-tempos and stuff .
And so I brought the pocket down , and I think I got somewhere between a good lyric and a nice melody .
`` The lyric itself , he says , `` is about someone being passed by .
Someone being passed over .
Someone who 's just mis-lived their life a little bit and gone on to see someone else do very , very well , and not be envious , or more sorrowful that the guy was n't able to keep up with somebody . ''
`` And love from afar , '' he adds .
`` Still loving someone . ''
Staying busy is certainly no problem for Jesse .
He tackles simultaneous multiple projects with relish ; he is a songwriter , guitar player , recording artist and producer for his band the Gin Blossoms , he is also a solo recording artist , he does a lot of film and TV work , and he produces independent recording artists .
`` Producing is time consuming , '' says the always-humble Jesse .
`` I do it sort of out of efficiency .
By the time I finish my demos and stuff , and the guys all play on it , it 's sort of a song already , so I just sit there .
I do n't get the idea of having a middleman anymore . ''
