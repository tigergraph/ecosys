Holly Williams was originally going to title her The Highway album after this road song about a preacher 's son who drinks moonshine and marries a prostitute , but never quite figures out his reasons for leaving home .
Hank 's granddaughter had completed the record and was ready to ship with the title Railroad but switched it at the last minute .
Holly told us : `` It had already been sent to my booking agent .
It had not been sent out to the press yet , but it had been sent out to friends and family and music city people and here it is .
So I called it ` Railroad ' , and I still had the same kind of thing .
Like I 've been at this crossroads for years doing a thousand different things .
And all these different subject matters and songs .
So that was the title of the album .
And then last minute I went in , everything changed . ''
