This song was one of several tracks on the album that were inspired by Jonathan Davis ' near-death experience with a blood disease .
Davis explained to the Real Detroit Weekly : `` When I was in Europe I came down with a blood disorder called ITP , and thinking I was going to die made me rearrange my priorities in life and think about what 's really important .
It kept going through my head , me dying and my sons not being able to have a dad to grow up with , s -- t drove me crazy , I really pooled from that experience to write a lot of the lyrics . ''
Terry Bozzio -LRB- Frank Zappa , Missing Persons -RRB- played drums on this track and seven others on the album .
Jonathan Davis was full of admiration for Bozzio 's efforts saying on the band 's website : `` Terry has got ta be the best drummer in the world ; he brought a more progressive feel to the band .
His drum kit was huge , and all the colors and sounds he made pushed our music in different directions we might not ever have thought about going . ''
