Redding wrote this with Jerry Butler -LRB- `` For Your Precious Love , '' `` Only the Strong Survive '' -RRB- in a Buffalo hotel room .
In 1969 a cover by Ike and Tina Turner peaked at # 68 in the US , selling over 500,00 copies .
Bob Krasnow , who bought the track to Ike Turner then produced their version , recalled in a 1971 Rolling Stone magazine article that Ike hated Otis Redding : `` He just did n't think Otis had it . ''
The famed multi-instrumentalist Booker T. Jones played piano on several of Otis ' hits , including this one .
Speaking to Mojo magazine October 2011 , he recalled : `` My experience having been a church player , and having had the classical experience , really helped there .
The ` walk-ups ' on those songs are classical type walk-ups , the way the chorus progresses to where the chromatics strike , that emotion .
Those were integral to me as a person and to the song .
Working on something like that , Otis and me became very good friends , you know , spending time on the road or in a studio together .
` I 've Been Loving You Too Long ' and ` Try A Little Tenderness . '
Those were , I think , some of our best moments together . ''
This was Redding 's best selling single and biggest hit while he was alive .
Redding died in a plane crash on December 10 , 1967 .
