This track from Portland-based singer-songwriter Alela Diane 's third album Alela Diane & Wild Divine tells a heartache story about somebody she is acquainted with .
`` The song is about a woman I know who shall remain anonymous ... It 's not about me , '' the singer told Spinner UK .
The video features Diane walking through London and sitting alone at a bar .
The clip was shot in the Soho area of London and the close-up shots were filmed on a rooftop close to where Elton John supposedly wrote `` Your Song .
`` For the bar scenes , Diane did n't opt for the usual option of having iced tea stand in for booze .
`` I rarely drink whiskey , but I drank a little for the bar scene , '' she told Spinner .
`` I passed off what I could n't handle to my husband , Tom . ''
