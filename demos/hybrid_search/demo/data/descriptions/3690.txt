This was written by Summer together with Lester Mendez -LRB- Shakira , Santana -RRB- and Wayne Hector .
The latter 's songwriting partnership with Steve Mac has resulted in a number of UK # 1s for Westlife including the 1999 UK Song of the Year `` Flying Without Wings '' and their only UK chart-topper to also chart in the US top 20 `` Swear it Again . ''
He also wrote O-Town 's breakthrough single `` All or Nothing . ''
When Donna Summer was approached by Burgundy Records to record an album , the '70s Disco Queen played this song to the executives .
As a consequence they decided to let Summer record an entire album of her compositions , rather than their original idea of a set of covers .
