This song finds Kravitz delving into old school R&B / funk .
He told Spinner : `` I 've always been a funk player , really .
And it just felt right .
I felt like a lot of the music that I grew up listening to in junior high and high school , which is more funk-oriented music , was coming out of me , and it just went in that direction .
It 's not something that I thought about .
It just went there on its own .
If I plan to do something on an album , I 'll end up going the opposite way .
It never works out to say , ` OK , this is what I 'm doing .
This is the album I 'm going to make . '
It does n't work that way . ''
A remixed version by Swedish DJ Avicii charted in the UK singles chart , Kravitz 's first entry there since `` California '' peaked at # 62 in 2004 .
Said Avicii to Billboard magazine .
`` He 's really talented and a really cool artist .
I 've been a fan for a long time so I was secretly happy to be able to play around his vocals . ''
