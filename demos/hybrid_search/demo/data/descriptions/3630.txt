This bump 'n' grinder finds Bowie heading off to `` Finchley Fair '' in search of excitement .
`` When the sun goes down and the die is cast , '' he croons , `` and you have no chance .
We will run with the dirty boys . ''
Producer Tony Visconti told NME : `` That 's probably looking back at glam rock .
Not him - the other dirty boys ! ''
The Finchley Fair is a large fun fair that has been held every year in Victoria Park , Finchley each July , dating back to 1905 .
The song features Steve Elson 's sleazy baritone sax .
Visconti told Rolling Stone : `` It 's dark and it 's sexy .
There 's a fantastic sax solo .
You know , David plays baritone sax , but he invited his friend Steve Elson to do the baritone on this album .
I think Steve was in the Saturday Night Live band .
He 's a little guy , and he 's got a huge baritone sax , and he plays this dirty solo in it that sounds like stripper music from the 1950s .
Old bump-and-grind stripper music ... It would n't be out of place on Young Americans .
`` Veteran saxophonist Steve Elson joined Bowie 's band on his 1983 Serious Moonlight Tour and also appeared on his Let 's Dance , Tonight , Never Let Me Down and Heathen albums .
