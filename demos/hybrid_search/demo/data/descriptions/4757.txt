This post-punk tune re-unites Weller with bass guitarist Bruce Foxton for the first time since The Jam split in 1982 .
Weller told The NME : `` He lost his wife at the early part of the year , and I lost my dad , and it opened up a bit of a dialogue , and it seemed like a nice thing to do at the time .
In fact it was a wonderful thing . ''
Weller said of this song : `` It 's a real London tune .
It 's a pretty full on .
We played this on the last tour and people were really mad for it .
It was really interesting to hear Bruce -LRB- Foxton -RRB- playing on it .
You can instantly tell it 's him . ''
