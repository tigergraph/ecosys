Singer James Allan wrote this number about gang violence and the fear of being attacked in the East End of Glasgow , an area the band calls home .
It name checks a local knife gang `` The Baltic Fleeto . ''
Allan told the Daily Record August 5 , 2008 : `` It is trying to express common fears .
I 'm not telling anyone anything new . ''
The song 's dramatic prose is set against the piano of Beethoven 's `` Moonlight Sonata . ''
Allan revealed to The Sun August 15 , 2008 : `` That was the first thing I wrote for the band .
I had the lyrics and for some reason I tried to do the music for it a few times but never really got it right .
Then I heard ` Moonlight Sonata . '
Immediately I heard Beethoven , I saw a street near where I live .
I could visualize Springfield Road , in Glasgow .
I could see it when I wrote the words .
Then , when I heard that music , I saw that same place , and right away I knew exactly that I needed to not sing , I needed to recite it as a poem.I think everybody just thought I was a loony because I said : ` I 've got this idea .
I 'm going to get Beethoven and I 'm going to speak on top of Beethoven ' and I think the label and the band were just like , ` Has he lost the plot ? '
Rab -LRB- Allan , lead guitar -RRB- said , ` It sounds great , man ! '
but I think he was still thinking , ` He 's really losing it ' .
It was a strange thing and I do n't know if I 'll ever do that again . ''
This is likely to be a nod to The Shangri-Las ' 1966 spoken-word single `` Past , Present and Future , '' which was also based around `` Moonlight Sonata . ''
