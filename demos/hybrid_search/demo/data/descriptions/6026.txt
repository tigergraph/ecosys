This song was a moderate hit at the time of its release , but it showed great staying power , and it remains a favorite of the group 's most loyal fans .
It 's quite the love song , about a man who is still waiting for the love of his life to return long after she walked out on him , and there seems to be hope that they will be reunited .
The reasons for the break-p are never spelled out , but few seem to care .
