Christian is one of two reoccurring characters that feature on 21st Century Breakdown .
Whilst The activist Gloria , who is fighting to hold on to her youthful idealism is a combination of frontman Billie Joe Armstrong and his wife Adrienne , the destructive , inflammatory Christian , is the side of Billie Joe that he tries to keep under wraps .
Armstrong told Q magazine May 2009 , that the title of this song refers to the , `` sort of ugliest place you could possibly go in your brain . ''
He added : `` I do n't know if I was having a bad morning but it 's that angry feeling of despair that I guess a lot of people can relate to . ''
Rolling Stone asked Armstrong why he still felt the need to confront his demons when the Green Day frontman now is in a comfortable position with a nice house and family .
He replied : `` They 're just photographs of what goes on inside my head - and wanting to connect with yourself , and your audience too .
I 'd like to write something more about joy and happiness .
But for me , that 's the release , putting it out there .
To put it out there and create some kind of human connection and strive for something that 's about humanity .
It 's like trying to battle past all those demons , your confusion and chaos , to reach something on the other side .
I do n't know why I 'm like that .
I 've always felt desperate in some way . ''
Armstrong told MTV News that this `` is the most hateful song I 've ever written - the most diabolic . ''
