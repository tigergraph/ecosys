This brooding electronic rocker was omitted from the final track listing of The King of Limbs , but was uploaded by Radiohead on their YouTube account shortly before it made TV debut on their BBC performance From The Basement on July 1 , 2011 .
The King of Limbs : Live From the Basement concert was aired online and on a number of channels internationally , but did n't get transmitted in the UK after running into problems with its planned British distributor BBC Worldwide .
There are two look-alike drummers featured on the video clip - Radiohead stickman Phil Selway is joined by British percussionist Clive Deamer , who is best known for his contributions to the Bristol based Trip Hop and Drum And Bass scenes , particularly Portishead and Roni Size and Reprazent .
`` You 're not seeing double , '' Selway wrote .
`` The doppelganger drummers are myself and Clive Deamer .
-LSB- He -RSB- has long been one of my favorite drummers . ''
Radiohead played the song on the first episode of the thirty-seventh season of Saturday Night Live , which was broadcast on September 24 , 2011 .
