Nicko McBrain wrote the lyrics and the bassline to this song .
It is a re-telling of the story of Frankenstein , but from the scientist 's point of view .
He feels that Frankenstein is `` playing God without mercy , without fear , '' and wants to kill himself before getting killed by Frankenstein .
