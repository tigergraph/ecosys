This was the first song Nick Waterhouse recorded , and served to launch his musicmaking career .
It was recorded on a whim during a period when Waterhouse was feeling very aimless and frustrated .
At the time , he had no idea the song would lead to any sort of career in music , and was simply trying to express the raw feelings he was struggling with .
Limited to only 300 copies , the record quickly sold out and served to establish Waterhouse 's musical presence .
The track started out as a few lines that popped into Waterhouse 's head while working at a San Francisco coffee shop .
A follow-up session of trying to develop the lyrics and set them to music inspired him to record the single .
The original vinyl single is out of print , but sells for over $ 200 on eBay .
The song uses Waterhouse 's retro R&B stylings , while lyrically it expresses frustration with being stuck in a particular time and place with no escape in sight .
He 's not sure exactly where he wants to go - and maybe it does n't even matter , as long as that place is somewhere else .
`` Well , it 's something , '' he says , `` it 's not quite clear , it 's a place I can only say is not quite here . ''
The track appears on his debut , Times All Gone , but was originally released in 2010 as a single .
The song was distributed by Waterhouse 's own label , Pres Records .
