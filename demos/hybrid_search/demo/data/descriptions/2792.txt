This is the title track from American bluesman Seasick Steve 's fourth album .
On this track , Steve reflects back to the time when life was simpler .
He told Uncut magazine that he 's a bit bewildered by the stature he 's acquired having found fame so late in his life .
He explained : `` I 'm not trying to be modest , but three years ago , the odds against me doing any good would have seemed about four billion to one .
And like I say in the song , I do feel lost in the new world .
The only modern thing I want is a mobile phone -- I 've been sick a few times , so my wife wo n't let me travel without one . ''
