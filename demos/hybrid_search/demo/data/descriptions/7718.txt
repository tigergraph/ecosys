Nick Jonas told Time Out how this song was inspired by a James Bond movie .
He explained : `` The funny thing about ` Vesper 's Goodbye ' is that I was actually writing that song with a friend of mine -LSB- P.J. Bianco -RSB- who I 've written a lot of songs with .
We were in a studio , and one of the TVs was playing James Bond , Casino Royale .
We 're watching it , and it 's the scene where she 's underwater , this emotional scene , and without any music .
We looked at each other and said , ` There 's so much emotion in that scene , that would make a great song . '
We had just listened to the Kings of Leon record and were inspired by that , so we started playing this with that visual going on in the background , and it just worked .
It 's kind of fun to tell people that , because they 're like , ` What happened in your life ? '
And I 'm like , ` James Bond ! ' ''
Nick -LRB- from Shine On Media -RRB- : `` It 's about the final breathe of love .
Kind of realizing that you have to let that go sometimes .
It 's a song that I think a lot of people can relate to .
It 's an emotional song to perform as well . ''
