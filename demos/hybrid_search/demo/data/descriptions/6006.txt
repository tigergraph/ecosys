This song , in which Mayer confesses to being half-hearted in a relationship , is a collaboration with Country-Pop star Taylor Swift .
John `` tweeted '' about wanting to record the song with Taylor back in March 2009 : `` Waking up to this song idea that wo n't leave my head .
3 days straight now .
That means it 's good enough to finish , '' he wrote on his Twitter page .
`` It 's called ` Half of My Heart ' and I want to sing it with Taylor Swift .
She would make a killer -LSB- Stevie -RSB- ` Nicks ' in contrast to my ` Tom -LSB- Petty -RSB- '' of a song . ''
Mayer told MTV News that the idea for the song came to Mayer in a dream .
`` I woke up with the song in my head called ` Half of My Heart , ' '' he recalled .
`` And the idea is that it 's this real sort of updated - not that it needs to be updated - sort of Tom Petty , Fleetwood Mac , Stevie Nicks thing .
`` He added .
`` I thought , ` Well , if this is going to be my love letter to that style of music , who 's going to be the Stevie Nicks in this equation ? '
And I thought , ` This Taylor Swift girl is going to be around for a long time . ' ''
It has been said that Mayer 's former beau , Jennifer Aniston , got annoyed with the singer spending more time on his Twitter updates than with her .
His explanation of the lyrical content of this song to The London Times January 2 , 2010 suggests that the rumor is true .
He explained that it 's about `` questions of , do I want to share my desires with someone else or do I just want to sate them myself with my laptop and my Twitter account ?
- these are substituting relationships .
Knowing that I could blog right now from my iPhone and it 's up on the internet with people reading it and responding to it .
How much is that a synthetic version of having dinner with somebody ?
How intimidating must it be to try to find an ` in ' with the man who is consistently satisfying himself by all means necessary ?
Where is her place in that ? ''
