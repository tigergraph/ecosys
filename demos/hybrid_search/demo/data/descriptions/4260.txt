The heartbreaking ballad features just Colin Meloy 's voice accompanied by acoustic guitar .
The singer explained to Spin magazine that this track is about the Iraq War and how parents are affected when their children are shipped off to battle .
`` I imagine it being a letter sent from a mother to a solider , '' he said .
`` I was reading a lot about soldiers and the war and their parents back home -- having a kid myself , it just made me really mindful of that relationship . ''
