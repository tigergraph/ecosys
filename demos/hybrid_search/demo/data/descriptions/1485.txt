This song penned by Monty Criswell and Wade Kirby is the only track on Learn to Live that Rucker has no writing credit for .
He explained on his record label 's website why this was included on the record : '' -LSB- Capitol Records president -RSB- Mike Dungan had sent me two or three demos and I did n't dig them , but the first time I heard this one , I really wanted to cut it .
We went round and round about whether we were going to put this on the record .
I was talking to my wife about it ; sometimes she thought it was a great song , other times she thought it was morbid .
Eventually she said we could n't take it off .
I do n't think it will ever be a single , people will find this one on their own .
I do n't think 10 years ago I would have recorded this song , but everyone knows someone who 's been in a car accident .
I hope no one they ever love is in that situation . ''
