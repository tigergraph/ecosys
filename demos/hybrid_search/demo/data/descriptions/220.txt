This song was written by Espen Lind , who makes up one half of the Norwegian songwriting and music production team Espionage , as well as by Carmen Key , whose credits include Flo Rida 's `` Club Ca n't Handle Me '' and the French producer Sandy Vee .
Selena told Billboard magazine : '' ` Middle of Nowhere ' is also one of my mom 's favorites .
She definitely loves jamming out to that song .
It 's just beautiful .
If you just read the lyrics without listening to the music , it 's really beautiful .
I did n't write that one but it 's gorgeous and I feel like everybody can related to it .
Then you add all the fun pop beats and synths behind the song and it just really makes you want to move .
It felt like the music and the lyrics worked out so perfectly together . ''
