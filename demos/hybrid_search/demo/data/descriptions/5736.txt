Gabrielle Aplin is an Indie-Folk singer-songwriter from Sutton Benger , a village 20 miles east of Bath , in south west England .
She first developed a fan base after publishing acoustic covers of songs by bands such as Paramore and You Me At Six on YouTube .
After self-releasing three EPs on the Never Fade Records label , Aplin announced in 2012 that she had signed to Parlophone .
This cover of the Frankie Goes To Hollywood hit was released as her first single on November 9 , 2012 .
According to Aplin , she 's been given the thumbs up by Frankie Goes To Hollywood for her version of their tune .
She said : `` I was worried people might hate me because they were so attached to the original single .
But I 've since been in touch with -LRB- lead singer -RRB- Holly Johnson , and he said some lovely things about my take on his song . ''
The song was selected to soundtrack the John Lewis 2012 Christmas advertisement after Aplin lobbied the department store for a year to sing their Christmas song .
`` I tried to find John Lewis on Twitter .
He has n't been alive for a long time , '' the singer told the Evening Standard .
`` I then started pestering people at John Lewis before I realised I was tweeting people who worked in the actual shop .
`` Aplin 's rendition was finally chosen over eight others submitted to John Lewis.Previous songs that have sound tracked the John Lewis Christmas advertisement include Ellie Goulding 's `` Your Song '' and Slow Moving Millie 's `` Please , Please , Please Let Me Get What I Want . ''
The song climbed to # 1 in its 4th week on the UK singles chart .
Its ascent to the top was attributed in part to a performance of the song in the X Factor semifinal by the eventual show winner James Arthur .
