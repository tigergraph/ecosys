There are plenty of Christmas songs , including one by Jethro Tull , but few about the winter solstice , which takes place on the shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere - either December 21st or 22nd .
The song describes a solstice celebration in medieval times , with dancing druids and ringing bells.According to frontman Ian Anderson , it is one of just a few songs he wrote simply looking for a hit song .
He told us : `` I deliberately attempted to write , if not a pop song , at least a song that was catchy enough to be getting radio play and achieve something in the singles charts . ''
