In this song , everything in the singer 's life has gone and he needs to run home .
The Factory Girl in the song represents the girl in the record company that treated the band unfairly .
The band is from Quebec , and the music video shows many of Canada 's forests and dirt roads .
-LRB- thanks , Scott - Jacksonvill , FL , for all above -RRB- Priestess recorded an instrumental version of this song for the hit movie Surf 's Up .
