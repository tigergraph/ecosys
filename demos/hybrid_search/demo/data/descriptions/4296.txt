Lambert wrote this with Natalie Hemby and Jennifer Kennard .
She said : `` Natalie has such cool ideas that I would never think of .
I always go straight to love gone bad -- pretty much the same thing all the time .
I did n't really know what a Virginia bluebell was .
But it 's a little flower that hangs down like a bell , and it sort of droops , but it 's beautiful .
This song is something so different for me .
I 've never heard a song like that and never would have thought of writing it on my own .
The dead flowers came back to life as Virginia bluebells ! ''
