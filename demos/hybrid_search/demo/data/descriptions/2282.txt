This circle-of-life cut revolving around a car was penned by Tony Douglas and Keith Gattis .
Strait explained that he was pitched the song by his son , Bubba .
`` The way I found it was , my son , one of his rodeo buddies ... had given Bubba a CD , '' he said .
`` So , I took it home and I laid it on the coffee table , and it sat there for two or three weeks . ''
`` He asked me about it one day , '' Strait continued , `` and I said , ` Naw , I have n't heard it yet , but I will when I get back home . '
So , I got it and stuck it in the player and started listening to it .
This song was on there , along with a couple of others .
` Sittin ' on the Fence ' was on there also , I believe .
I said , ` Hey man !
This guy is a good writer .
I want to hear more of his stuff . '
Bubba was emailing back and forth with him .
He kept sending me more and more stuff .
That 's how I got ` Blue Melodies , ' ' I Got a Car ' and ` Sittin ' on the Fence . ' ''
