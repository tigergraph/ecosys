This slice of old-fashioned radio pop is the first single from 100 Miles From Memphis , the seventh studio album from American singer and songwriter Sheryl Crow .
The album was written and produced by Crow with co-producers Doyle Bramhall II and Justin Stanley .
The team wrote the music first and left Crow to pen the lyrics afterwards , which she told Billboard Magazine `` was like having homework . ''
Crow commented on the song 's music video , `` My friend Keith Megna made an amazing ` Summer Day ' video for us - inspired by a great day in Central Park and our actual studio recording of the song . ''
Crow explained on her website concerning this song , `` I wanted to experiment with writing something simple and positive .
The feeling of a great , solid love -- not just a new love , but something everlasting . ''
Crow told Spinner about the song : `` I thought I would collaborate on this one with Justin .
The track is really uplifting .
Our objective was to write something that was wholly positive and about optimism .
This what summer is to me , metaphorically , especially that first day of being out of school and the excitement about what 's ahead .
And particularly this moment in our historical state , with the -LSB- BP -RSB- oil spill and all the wars and the political fighting , it 's nice to have a song that is uplifting and it makes you feel useful and giddy . ''
