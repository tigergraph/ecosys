London-based singer-songwriter Emmy The Great 's second album Virtue was an attempt to write a record based entirely on imaginary situations .
However , following a split from a previously-atheist lover , who left her to dedicate himself to the church most of the songs ended up being about herself .
She told the NME : `` The first half of the album is about impending doom and the second half is about dealing with the aftermath . ''
Talking about why she named this song `` Dinosaur Sex , '' she explained to NME : `` Someone just said it out loud once and it made me laugh .
The point of the song is , ` What did it do ? '
It did absolutely f -- k all for them -LSB- dinosaurs -RSB- did it ? ''
Emmy discussed this apocalyptic tune with The Guardian : `` During one tour I took photos of power plants in the north of England .
When I started writing songs for Virtue I stuck these pictures on my wall , along with some of a cargo bay in Hong Kong that had fascinated me as a kid .
I 'm terrified about climate change in an abstract way , which I imagine is what it was like to be growing up in the shadow of the bomb .
I would have been one of those people who built a bunker .
I think there is always a young person terrified about the end of the world , whenever and wherever humans have got to . ''
