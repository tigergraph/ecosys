Warpaint is an experimental art rock group from Los Angeles formed in 2004 .
The group has gone through many line-up changes , including actress Shannyn Sossamon and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer .
The personnel who played on their debut album The Fool were Emily Kokal -LRB- vocals/guitar -RRB- , Theresa Wayman -LRB- vocals/guitar -RRB- , Jenny Lee Lindberg -LRB- bassist/vocals -RRB- , and Stella Mozgawa -LRB- drums/keyboards -RRB- .
Wayman discussed Warpaint 's songwriting process in an interview with American Songwriter magazine .
She explained that some tracks originate from a band member bringing a song to the group whilst there are others , `` that have come about just from us jamming and saying , ' I like that change , we should keep it in the song . '
Or someone might be jamming vocally with a guitar or keyboard , and then we decide to restructure it into something that can become an actual song .
`` Wayman continued : `` For instance , I wrote ` Shadows ' from start to finish , but everybody else pretty much writes their part .
I do n't write Jen 's basslines , I do n't write Stella 's drum parts .
But if we have ideas , we definitely will tell each other .
Like for ` Shadows , ' I definitely had an idea of how I wanted the drums to sound and when they kick in , and Stella executed it far better than I ever could with her own spice . ''
According to Wayman , it was the darker aspects of LA that inspired a lot of the writing on The Fool including this song .
She told Q magazine : '' ` Shadows was me being confused about why you live in a place so surrounded by concrete streets .
There 's always a sound happening here .
Always helicopters or car stereos and a fair amount of violence on the streets .
We witnessed a cyclist in front of my old house get killed , and there was a white ghost bike there for some time after .
That kind of darkness you can feel sometimes . ''
