This is a track from Unbroken , the sophomore album of American Idol season five runner-up , Katharine McPhee .
She told AOL 's PopEater that the album reveals a different side of herself and her personality .
Said McPhee : `` I think spending a whole year trying to figure out where I wanted to go musically and who I was really as an artist comes out in this music .
Coming off of the show that I did and making the record as fast as I did , I always just sang .
I did n't develop myself as an artist and know who I was and where I wanted to go .
It was a little confusing for me and this last year I spent a lot of time discovering that .
It 's real discovery and the hardships that I went through and trying to discover musically who I am in a more grown up perspective .
One of the lyrics from the song ` How ' is ` Get up out of that bed/turn the lights on/try to forget where it went wrong . '
So many things I can relate to in my life - not to say that it 's depressing , but it definitely has darker lyrics with a positive outlook .
There 's a lot of negative things in life , but it 's trying to keep that positive energy .
It 's a rebirth of myself . ''
