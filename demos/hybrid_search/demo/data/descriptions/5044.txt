This tale of unrequited love finds frontwoman Shirley Manson trying to untangle herself from a complicated relationship .
She told Artist Direct : `` I think that 's a really beautiful song .
It 's funny .
The title is obviously quite provocative , but the sentiment behind the song is really beautiful , gentle , and vulnerable .
It 's a universal feeling that we all endure at some points in our lives .
It 's that horrible feeling when you love someone and they do n't love you back . ''
In February 2012 , Garbage requested their fans send them `` love-hating artistic creations -- paintings , drawings , photos inspired '' by Valentine 's Day .
On the 14th , the band released a sneak-peak video of the song showcasing some of the art .
Guitarist Duke Erikson told MusicRadar.com : `` I Hate Love started out as a ballad .
I think Butch -LRB- Vig -RRB- and Shirley put their heads together and brought it in , and then we rewrote the chorus chords a bit and reworked the arrangement .
For a time , it was a slow , moody ballad -- and could still serve as that -- but we decided that the album had too many slow songs , so we sped it up . ''
