North Carolina rapper J. Cole did most of the production himself on his debut album Cole World : The Sideline Story .
However , this cut was helmed by renowned Chicago beatmaker No I.D. -LRB- Kanye West , Alicia Keys -RRB- .
He told The Boombox : `` The first person I got in with was No I.D. and it 's funny how it happened because last year we started having conversations about No I.D. but I 've been producing my stuff for so long that my concept was initially like , ' I do n't need anybody .
I 'm good . '
I 've been doing this my way for so long .
`` Cole added that he recorded tracks with other producers but found his style most similar to No I.D. 's .
`` If I was gon na get in with anybody it was the right decision to go with No I.D. , '' he said , `` because his style so closely resembles mine - or what I want to be - but he is a pro to the next level and I learned so many things from him . ''
Cole explained the lyrical content to Billboard magazine : `` Every studio session with No I.D. is always great conversation followed by work , and that 's what was happening .
` Never Told ' was the last song that we did on that first time I was there , and it was a culmination of all these conversations that we were having about life and relationships .
So when we did ` Never Told , ' all of that came out in that song . ''
