Selena concludes her first solo album , Stars Dance , with this heartfelt ballad , which mournfully chronicles the end of her relationship with Justin Bieber .
`` That 's the most personal track on the record , for sure .
I think it 's a sweet way of releasing it .
It 's not an aggressive approach to what people are probably expecting , '' she told InStyle magazine before adding quietly , `` I 'm sure he 'll love it too . ''
The song was penned by frequent Selena Gomez & The Scene collaborators Rock Mafia along with David Jost and Desmond Child .
Selena told Jam !
Music : '' ` Love Will Remember ' was actually a really fun track for me to actually go in with a producer and just work with them and the producer that worked on that album on that song , they 've known me since I was 15 so they 've been through a lot with me . ''
An audio version leaked online on July 9 , 2013 with a voicemail recording at the beginning of the song .
Though there was no official confirmation , it was assumed that it was Justin Bieber who was saying , `` Hey , Babe , it 's me .
I just want to call and tell you that I love you so , so , so much .
I just wanted to let you know that you are my princess .
You are worthy of all the love in the world .
You are the love of my life . ''
The recording was eventually cut from the official album version of the song .
