A Billboard magazine review suggested that whilst on As Cruel as school Children , frontman Travis McCoy 's lyrical `` vice of choice '' was cocaine , on The Quilt it was women .
The report referred to not only this song , but also `` Innocent '' and `` Cookie Jar '' on The Quilt as numbers about unfaithfulness in a relationship .
McCoy responded by saying that with the exception of `` Cookie Jar , '' the theme of this record has little to nothing to do with infidelity though he admitted that this song can be `` misleading , '' as it refers to his `` affair with music . ''
McCoy explained to Artist Direct why they made this the last track on the album : `` Since we put out our first record , it 's always been important for us to put emphasis on the album 's very last song .
When they get through the end of a record , a lot of people will be like , ` Oh , whatever . '
We did n't want to do that with any of our records , so there 's always been a really strong emphasis on the final song .
That 's the last impression when somebody listens to your record all the way through -- if they even do listen to it all the way through because a lot of kids have ADD -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
If they get to the end of your record , you want the last impression to be a strong one .
That way it leaves them wanting more .
We 've always taken a lot of time choosing the last song and making sure that it leaves a good impression .
` Coming Clean ' is one of my favorite songs .
Lyrically and musically , it 's like , ` Wow . '
The piano is so dark and eerie .
We definitely took our time with it . ''
