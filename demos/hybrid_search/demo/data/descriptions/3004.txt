White told NME regarding this waltzing Country tune : `` It was the bassline I wanted it to feed off , this grooving bassline .
It had such a jazzy feel to it when we started I was like , ` Wow , this is really taking off into another direction , it almost could be an eight-minute song . '
It really got off on all the musicians , it really felt good to them . ''
White said to NME regarding the song 's meaning : `` There 's this character who 's jealous of inanimate objects , a rock and the moon and the sun , because they do n't have to change , they do n't have to alter what they are , they just are and that 's it . ''
