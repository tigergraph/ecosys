The subject of this song is a gorgeous-looking girl who drives other women insane with jealousy .
Annie explained the origins of the song to Digital Spy : `` Well , a friend of mine is a really great girl who happens to hang out with a lot of guys .
One day this other girl came up to her and said , ` You 've been spending quite a lot of time with my boyfriend and I do n't really like that . '
My friend got into a lot of trouble for this , and kept telling me about it , so I thought ` Why do n't I write a song about it ? ' ''
Annie explained on her website how this song was influenced by Prince .
She said : `` When I started writing for the album I wanted to be inspired by Prince 's ` Kiss , ' and while the lyrics came later that 's how ' I Know Ur Girlfriend Hates Me ' started off . ''
