Sexsmith penned this song during a period of disillusionment about the music business caused by the difficulties in getting his previous disc , Long Player Late Bloomer , released .
He explained to UK newspaper The Sun : `` I get these feelings of anxiety from time to time and it makes me want to hide or disappear .
I wrote this one not long after ` Nowhere To Go ' so I guess I was still feeling a bit rejected by all the US labels and thought perhaps I should pack it in .
This feeling comes and goes I guess . ''
