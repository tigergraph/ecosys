Tedeschi co-wrote this track with veteran swamp rocker Tony Joe White , who penned the standard `` Rainy Night In Georgia '' back in 1962 .
Tedeschi told Billboard magazine that the Back to the River album was made quickly , though not necessarily by design .
She recalled : `` I did most of my tracks in two days .
I had to 'cause I did n't have any time in July and the label wants it for fall , which is insane .
I was free all those months - January , February , March , April I left open to make a record .
The label kept putting it off and then finally they got behind it and everything started to flow , but I was already out touring . ''
Despite being rushed the album debuted at # 71 on The Billboard 200 , the highest peak position of Tedeschi 's career .
