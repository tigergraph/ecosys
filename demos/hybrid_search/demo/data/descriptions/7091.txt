Stricken means a wound or being hurt by an action of someone or something .
In this song , the lead singer is hurt by something a woman did to him .
When he says , `` I 'm crippled by all that you 've done , into the abyss will I run , '' it means that he ca n't forgive himself for what was happened , as if it was his fault for his misfortune .
