This cover of obscure '60s psychedelic rocker Faine Jade 's song `` Introspection '' was cut at producer Dave Fridmann 's suggestion during a lull patch in recording sessions .
Keyboardist Ben Goldwasser told The Sun : `` In the studio we 'd just play for hours .
Songs came on some days and on others we 'd play what we liked and that was one of those songs that emerged in a very organic way . ''
Faine Jade was a former garage rocker from Long Island who at the age of 20 dropped an album .
The 1968 LP subsequently became a minor psychedelic cult item , but little has been heard from him since .
