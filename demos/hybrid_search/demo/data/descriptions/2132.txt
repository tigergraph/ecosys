Goulding wrote this song about her father , Arthur , who divorced her mum when she was five and then disappeared from her life .
She told The Sun : `` When I was talking about him when Lights was released , I was just on the war path .
Now , I try not to let it bother me so much - less bitterness and anger.Now I 've realised that I 'm so fortunate and my life is so incredible , so he 's not worth thinking about .
If he wants to get in touch he can but I do n't think he will .
It 's quite a thing to say but I do n't think he 'll ever be a big part of my life .
If he gets back in contact , maybe we could be mates or something .
But I 'm not worrying .
Life is pretty f -- ing good right now . ''
The Observer asked Goulding what her mother thinks of this song ?
She replied : `` I think she finds it incredibly sad .
She 's sad that we did n't have a dad in our lives , I think .
For some reason , she feels responsible , maybe every mother would .
But I do n't think she minds me using songs to help myself .
And it does help me to sing a song like that to a crowd , rather than mull over it . ''
A full version of the song features in the Dakota Fanning starring sentimental drama Now Is Good .
The music video features clips from the movie blended with scenes of Goulding performing the song in a living room .
