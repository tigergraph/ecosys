This track features Atlanta-based singer-songwriter Janelle Mon√°e , who also appears on `` Our Riotous Defects . ''
Frontman Kevin Barnes told Spin magazine : `` Meeting Janelle and her Wondaland Arts Society crew is one of the greatest things to happen in the past year .
There 's a weird disconnect between Athens and Atlanta .
I did n't really know any Atlanta musicians , but in the last few years I met Bradford Cox from Deerhunter and the Wondaland Arts Society , and it 's a beautiful artistic romance .
They 'll send me mixes of songs , and vice versa .
They 've been a huge influence and inspiration on me .
We 'll definitely work together a lot more in the future .
There are a lot of ideas in the works and those will probably be something we focus on a lot over the next year . ''
Barnes explained this song to Spin : `` It has sci-fi elements .
I 've been reading a lot of Philip K. Dick and thinking about the future -- people have a dark vision of it .
The track is about technology robbing us of our organic connection to nature .
It has a complex , semi-abstract story . ''
