Written by Nashville tunesmiths Brad and Brett Warrren and pop/rock/hiphop / dance hitmaker Kevin Rudolf , this cheerful , hopeful song was co-produced by Urban and Nathan Chapman . ''
` Little Bit Of Everything ' conveys a sentiment that 's always felt right to me , '' said Urban .
`` I connected with that from the first time I heard it .
I ` felt it ' and I loved it . ''
`` I gravitate towards the sound of a song and its instrumentation , '' he added regarding the pop-leaning , laid back tune .
`` On this song I was able to take the elements of sound that I 've used before and blend them together into a fusion of spirit and energy .
`` The song was released as the lead single from Urban 's eighth studio album , through country radio and his official app on May 13 , 2013 .
He debuted the song live on American Idol three days later .
The music video was directed by Isaac Ravishankara -LRB- K.T. Tunstall 's `` Feel It All , '' Ellie Goulding 's `` Bittersweet '' -RRB- .
Filming took place just outside of Nashville in June 2013 at Middle Tennessee State University 's Floyd Stadium and at one of Tennessee 's premiere landmark homes , Swanson Mansion .
`` I read the treatment , '' said Urban , `` and there 's elements in there that we 're going to sort of simplify as we go .
So , there 's sort of a Truman Show element to it that I really liked .
I thought that was a good way for the song to be represented in the video .
That was certainly the part of the treatment that I loved the most was this sort of duality of the surreal world and the real world and which is which . ''
