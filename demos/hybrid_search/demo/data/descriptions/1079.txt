This song , which features the rapper T.I. , was co-written and produced by the hitmaking team of The-Dream and Tricky Stewart .
Foxx explained to The Independent newspaper the inspiration behind his Man 's Intuition album : `` On my radio show I have this panel of beautiful women and they were talking about how men with a lot of money are n't all that .
But if a guy has no money , that 's no good either .
So I was thinking , ` What does a man have to do ?
What does a woman want ? '
We go from there and build the story and the songs . ''
