Jimmy Eat World 's Jim Adkins briefly explained to the hosts the grown-up sentiment behind the lyric .
`` Love songs are what make rock 'n roll go around .
It 's just sort me trying to take an honest look at what that might be in an older context .
In a non-bubblegum kind of way , '' the frontman said .
`` It 's also kind of more about bettering ourselves in the process .
It 's about focusing on making decisions instead of just resolutions . ''
