Lyrically , the song nods to the old folk tale of Chicken Little , who believes the sky is falling and the world is coming to an end when an acorn falls on its head .
Frontman Sonny Sandoval explained to Artist Direct : `` It 's that whole question of , ` What if the world is coming to an end ? '
We 're not living in the days of relaxing .
We should be conscious of what 's going on in the world we live in . ''
Aerosmith 's 1993 single `` Livin ' On The Edge '' single also references the Chicken Little fable in its lyrics .
-LRB- `` If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is fallin ' .
Even if it was n't would you still come crawling . '' -RRB-
