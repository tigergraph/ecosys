Duffy in The Sun February 29 , 2008 : `` That song is about losing somebody but not necessarily in a relationship .
It 's really about death , the cold silence that goes along with it and that feeling of fear when somebody suddenly disappears out of someone 's life .
I just wanted to create that atmosphere .
I ca n't say that I 've lost somebody that I 've lived with so I did n't perhaps sing it from a personal perspective . ''
Duffy added in the same Sun interview : `` I did n't want to make an album with every single song sounding the same .
I remember Bernard -LRB- Butler -RRB- and Jimmy -LRB- Hogarth -RRB- probably thinking I was a lunatic , you know , because they were like ` What are you looking for ? '
We 'd do one song and then I 'd try and move as far away from that as possible .
That 's why I think you just get this real mix of emotions , of light and shade . ''
