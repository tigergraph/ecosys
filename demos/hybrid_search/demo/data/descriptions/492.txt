Vero Beach , Florida .
It 's where Jake Owen grew up .
He spent his childhood there , his teenage years , and some of his adult life .
And then one day he felt the urge to pull up the anchor and sail out of town .
`` I feel like you ca n't grow in your life in any certain way without being under the shadow in the sense of your family , friends , and all that , without getting out and doing your own thing .
So I left .
It was the best thing I ever did . ''
`` My twin brother still lives there , my older brother lives there with his wife , my mom and dad live there .
And I went home this past Christmas - this was right before I wrote the song - and I went back to the same bars that I used to go to and hang out with my friends , and my same friends ' houses , my mom and dad 's house .
And even though I 'd gotten tired as a kid growing up and hearing my mom and dad preach to me all the time , my dad , he 'd say , ` Son , ' I 'd say , ` Yeah ? '
He 'd go , ` What ?! ' I 'd have to say , ` Yes , sir , ' you know ?
-LRB- laughing -RRB- And I got tired of that.But now I realize that that that those are the same reasons I still go back home , because of the morals and the values that were instilled in me and my friends .
And I would n't be the man I am today without the things that were instilled in me as a kid .
And that stems from my family and my friends , and just life in general . ''
