Guitarist Josh Cain explained to Alternative Press how this song came together : `` In November 2008 , we had come up with a very slow , pretty idea while jamming in Flower Studios in Minneapolis .
A few days later , we wrote this very dark , rocking part but had no idea where to go with it for a verse and chorus .
We decided to take that slow , pretty idea and speed it up and see if the two ideas fit together .
The parts worked well together , making it easy to write the chorus and bridge .
We were a little bummed because we loved the slow , pretty idea so much and did n't want to throw that idea away .
We tried it as an intro , and went back and forth about it without ever making a clear decision until we started pre-production with Mark , who said he liked it as the intro .
Justin wrote some intense , sad and yet uplifting words - some of my favorite on the album - pulling this angry , dark rock song together . ''
