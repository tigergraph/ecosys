This is the first single from the American Country music artist Jake Owen 's third album .
Texan singer-songwriter Eric Paslay , New Jersey native Dylan Altman and Nashville writer Terry Sawchuk , penned the song .
The homemade video was shot in Owen 's hometown of Vero Beach , Florida .
The song is the first cut that Owen did n't have a hand in writing .
`` I just want my songs to relate to people , '' he explained about choosing his material .
`` Those kinds of songs are what drive a career . ''
It was Owen 's former girlfriend who convinced him to record the song .
He recalled to The Boot : `` I was almost finished with my record .
I had that song on my email .
I listened to it over and over one night when my girlfriend at the time came downstairs , and we were breaking up .
She said , ` You 're an idiot if you do n't record this . '
I think she thought I was an idiot anyway , which is why she was leaving , but I did listen .
-LSB- Laughs -RSB- She liked it , and for a girl who never mentioned much about my music , because I think my music is the one thing that kept me away from her , so she never complimented me much on it - for her to say that , I knew .
I already knew in my mind it was a good song , but when she said that , I was like , all right , I 'm cutting it .
So it worked out .
It 's weird , I knew it would be a hit , but I did n't know it would be this big .
I do n't know what else to base it off of , because I 've never had anything like that .
I 've had hits on the radio , but this is different .
I keep telling folks , there 's a difference between a hit song and a career song , and this is a career song . ''
