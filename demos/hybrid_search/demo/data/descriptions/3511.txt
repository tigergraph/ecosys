This is the song on the album The Wall when the protagonist Pink finally yields to his inner demons and becomes a psychopathic , race-baiting fascist .
Roger Waters wanted this song to parody mindless stadium rock .
He told Rolling Stone in 2010 : `` We needed a beginning , so I went into a room with a bass guitar and went , ' I need something that 's really stupid-sounding .
Really loud , monolithic , dumb . '
And I 've grown rather fond of that riff in the intervening years . ''
Pink 's calling out of various minorities in the audience -LRB- that one looks Jewish , that one 's a coon , etc. -RRB- is a reference to the meetings of the British Union of Fascists before World War II .
in these meetings , the speakers would rant about how foreigners , minorities and socialists were destroying Britain .
Near the end of his speech , he would identify members of various minorities in the crowd , who would immediately be roughed up by the blackshirts -LRB- similar to Hitler 's brownshirts -RRB- and thrown out onto the sidewalk .
-LRB- thanks , Bill - Erie , PA , for above 2 -RRB-
