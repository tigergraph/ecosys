Martie Maguire : `` That song touches on the issue of infertility , which Emily and I both had to deal with .
I think we feel a responsibility to break down some of these barriers - it 's much more of a common problem than people realize .
Someone the other day asked me if twins ran in my family .
When I told them I did in vitro they said , ` Oh , so you took the easy way . '
I could n't believe they said that .
`` Emily Robison : `` We both got pregnant through in vitro fertilization , and people usually get all freaked out when we tell them that .
I do n't find it a stigma at all - people need to start talking about it , because it feels almost epidemic .
And it 's so wonderful that we have this technology . ''
