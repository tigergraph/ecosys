This song can either be understood as about dying or being betrayed by a friend .
It starts by saying , `` Two nights ago I was shot , a bullet sunk straight through my soul .
a friend pulled the trigger that silenced me '' and then in the sung part he says : `` I 'll watch you call , calling for me , you ca n't bring back time , close your eyes or look away / fate exposed and wo n't let me say . ''
