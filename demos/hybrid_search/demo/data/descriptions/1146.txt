In a March 2009 interview with the Dutch website FaceCulture , lead vocalist Biff Byford said this track was written atmospherically , while the band were playing ; he sang it at full volume , he said .
Usually Biff , who tends to write the lyrics to the band 's songs by himself , sits down in his own studio by candlelight to work things out .
The Valley Of The Kings is in Egypt , and contains over sixty tombs of its illustrious rulers of times long since past .
The fascination with Ancient Egypt - its history and its mythology - continues to this day , and this grandly produced track is a typical offering from Saxon , leading distinctly towards the mythological rather than the historical .
