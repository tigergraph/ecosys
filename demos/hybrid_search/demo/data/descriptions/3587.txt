Bundy wrote this with the Nashville songwriters Mike Shimshack and Luke Laird .
It 's the last track on her album Achin ' and Shakin ' , which is divided into two sides , with this song wrapping up the `` Shakin ' '' side .
In our interview with Laura Bell Bundy , she said of this song : `` Mike had done this track , got together with Luke and I , we wrote the song in 2 hours .
And we wanted a feel-good up-tempo , in-general love , not like ' I love you and you love me . '
It was like we love each other . ''
