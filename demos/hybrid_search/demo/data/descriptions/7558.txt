Ed Sheeran 's third single from his debut album + finds him using a Lego house as a metaphor for a relationship .
`` I 'm gon na pick up the pieces and build a Lego house , if things go wrong , we can knock it down , '' he sings .
Sheeran also used the plastic toy building brick as a simile on another + track , `` U.N.I. '' - `` I never wan na settle down come around break up the love like Lego now . ''
Lego originated in the workshop of Ole Kirk Christiansen , a carpenter from the small town of Billund , Denmark .
In 1932 he started making wooden toys to make a living after having lost his job during the depression and he named his new company Lego from the Danish words LEg GOdt -LRB- `` play well '' -RRB- .
Later , it was discovered that in Latin , the term `` Lego '' means `` I put together '' or `` I assemble . ''
Christiansen began making simple plastic toys as well as wooden ones after the Second World War and in 1949 began manufacturing the now famous interlocking Lego bricks .
Ole Christiansen was strongly anti-war , reflecting his Christian upbringing and the effects of the war .
Not wanting to encourage warlike construction with his new toy , he made sure that brown and green bricks , which could be used to represent camouflaged military vehicles , were virtually absent from basic Lego sets .
The song 's music video was filmed at the Forum , University of Hertfordshire and features Harry Potter actor Rupert Grint as an obsessive fan .
Sheeran told MTV UK that it was Grint 's Harry Potter colleague Tom Felton who was responsible for his starring role in the clip .
`` Tom is a fan of my music and started tweeting me , so I just took a chance and he hooked it all up , '' he explained .
`` It 's all down to him . ''
Sheeran penned the song with Producer/Songwriter Jake Gosling , who has also worked with drum and bass artist Wiley , including his hit single `` Cash In My Pocket . ''
The other credited songwriter is former Son of Dork guitarist Chris Leonard .
His resume includes co-penning `` Loving You '' from Paolo Nutini 's debut album These Streets .
Guess how Sheeran celebrated when he got the news that he 'd scored his first # 1 with + ?
He went to Hamley 's toyshop and bought a Lego Star Wars Millennium Falcon .
Then together with his pal , One Direction 's Harry Styles , they spent the night building spaceships with the coloured bricks .
Here 's some more songs that refer to Lego in their lyrics :1 -RRB- `` Xoxoxo '' by The Black Eyed Peas - `` I wan na stay connected like Lego You 're the gas to my car , you 're my petrol .
`` 2 -RRB- `` Up Out My Face '' by Mariah Carey - `` If we were two Lego blocks .
Even the Harvard University Graduating class of 2010 .
Could n't put us .
Back together again .
`` 3 -RRB- `` All Night Cinema '' by Just Jack - `` Sometimes they 're made of Lego Sometimes they 're made of gold .
And sometimes it 's hard to let go . ''
