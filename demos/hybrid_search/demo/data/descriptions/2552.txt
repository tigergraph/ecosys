The Canadian Rock band Third Day Grace close Transit Of Venus with this track .
Singer and guitarist Adam Gontier told Artist Direct : `` It ended up being a great song to finish the record on .
We were n't really sure where it was going to go in sequence on the album until the last minute when we decided .
Throughout the record , there 's some angst-y material and darker stuff .
That song is a little more positive .
It wraps up the album on a positive note .
It 's definitely one of my favorites . ''
The transit of Venus takes place when the planet Venus passes directly between the Sun and Earth and can be seen by us as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun .
The transits occur in a pattern that generally repeats every 243 years , with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121 and 105 years .
The last one took place on June 5-6 2012 , and you will have a long wait for the next transit , which will happen on December 10 -- 11 , 2117 .
Gontier told Artist Direct why he named the band 's fourth album after the astronomical event .
`` Through the whole record , there was this whole idea of how the Transit Of Venus happens once every 200 years or whatever , '' he explained .
`` You see a little speck that crosses .
In relation to the record , we write with that kind of vibe .
The songs really come down to the fact that we 're really just a little speck as well .
To wrap it up , ` Unbreakable Heart ' is a song about trying to stay strong and get through every day , taking it one day at a time . ''
