The first single from British indie rock band Wild Beasts ' third album Smother was originally written by the band 's vocalist Hayden Thorpe .
Bassist Tom Fleming explained to Drowned in Sound how the song evolved : `` Initially Hayden 's laptop piece , this was a really early signpost to what the album was going to be , all synthetic bass and cave reverbs .
We added a crappy xylophone and every bass instrument we could find .
This was always supposed to be the first single , we think it 's a calling card of the album .
We are of course aware of the other ` Albatross ' in pop music , but this is now the real one . ''
Lyrically , the song alludes to Coleridge 's classic symbol of guilt in his poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner .
With guilt comes blame and self-flagellation as Thorpe croons regretfully , `` the secrets that I should have shared . ''
Another song that references Coleridge 's 1797 poem is Rush 's `` Rime of the Ancient Mariner . ''
