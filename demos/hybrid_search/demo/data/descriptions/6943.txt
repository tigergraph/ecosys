This is the title track of Ellie Goulding 's second album .
The record describes a journey of two-and-a-half tumultuous years in her life towards hope .
Goulding recorded the set along with producer Jim Eliot -LRB- Kylie Minogue , Will Young -RRB- , in her home county of Herefordshire , near the Welsh border .
`` I think everyone thought it was recorded in a big studio somewhere , in LA or something , '' she told Billboard magazine .
`` After ` Lights ' I wanted to reground myself and record somewhere really quiet and peaceful .
-LRB- It 's -RRB- just a place I could really connect myself with again . ''
The song title does not appear in the lyrics but it is used to describe a feeling of calmness and peace that Goulding hopes for in the chorus -LRB- `` It 's gon na be better '' -RRB- .
This acoustic guitar-led track finds Goulding singing of loss and loneliness .
`` When it 's just us , you show me what it feels like to be lonely , '' she croons .
`` Loneliness has been the biggest influence on this record ; '' she said .
`` I feel like what I do is lonely . ''
