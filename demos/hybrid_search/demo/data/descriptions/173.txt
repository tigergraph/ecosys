This is the title track of the debut studio album from American Blues-Rock band Alabama Shakes .
The LP was released on April 9 , 2012 and has reached the top ten of several countries including Holland , Ireland , the UK and the US .
The song started in the late 2000s as little piano part Howard had .
She recalled to NME that bassist Zac Cockrell , `` came over and asked what key it was in and I was like , ` Ok , now it 's going to be a song . ' ''
This despondent waltz finds singer Brittany Howard recalling how she was mocked as a child for having a boy as a best friend .
`` We were best friends and we were like brother and sister , '' she told NME .
`` When we got older people always expected that we were a couple .
Then we were n't as good friends any more and it was n't fair . ''
