This is the title track of former The Czars frontman John Grant 's second solo album .
Pale Green Ghosts was recorded in Reykjavik , Iceland with Birgir Þórarinsson -LRB- a.k.a. Biggi Veira -RRB- of the Icelandic Electro-Pop group Gus Gus .
Inspired by the Russian olive trees that line Colarado 's I-25 highway , Grant would drive into Denver in the '80s to the new wave clubs .
He told Mojo magazine : `` The trees have these tiny leaves backed by silver , which glow in the moonlight like pale green ghosts .
The song is about wanting to get out of a small town , to become someone and make my mark . ''
The title refers to the Russian olive trees that stand along the I-25 highway near Grant 's family home in the small town of Parker , Colorado .
`` They have these pale green leaves with a silvery back , so they 're sort of luminescent in the moonlight , '' the enraptured singer told UK newspaper The Observer .
`` And at the end of May every year , like clockwork , they grow these tiny little yellow flowers that exude the most beautiful fragrance I 've ever smelled . ''
