The band 's lead singer/guitarist/lyricist Jon Fratelli is a very prolific writer , often squirreling away song ideas that later materialize .
He told The Sunday Mail : `` My mum will love this one - it 's a real Fratellis song title .
I wrote it about four years ago and always loved it but it never struck me right .
It took me so long to realize it 's the most typically Fratellis song I could write .
-LRB- Drummer -RRB- Mince -LRB- Fratelli -RRB- loves it and badgered me for ages to do it .
It 's typical of us lyric-wise . ''
