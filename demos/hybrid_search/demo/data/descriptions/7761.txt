West considers this a breakthrough song where he 'd learnt to come up with his own style .
He told the New York Times in a 2013 interview that when he first he wanted to perform Hip-Hop , `` my raps sounded like a bit like Cam ` ron ; they sounded a bit like Mase ; they sounded a bit like Jay-Z or whoever . ''
It was only after West started hanging out with and producing the New York hip hop duo Dead Prez that he understood how to make `` raps with a message sound cool that I was able to just write ` All Falls Down ' in 15 minutes . ''
