Kelly Rowland 's third single off her fourth studio album , Talk a Good Game , finds her speaking openly on her relationship with Beyoncé Knowles , as she admits to resentment about her former bandmate 's post-Destiny 's Child success .
`` Went our separate ways , but I was happy she was killin ' it .
Bittersweet , she was up , I was down , '' Rowland sings .
After tossing Beyoncé into her dirty laundry , the songstress then proceeds to detail a relationship with a verbally and physically abusive boyfriend .
who drove a wedge between her and `` Bey . ''
`` I was battered , he hit in a window like it was me until it shattered , '' Rowland croons .
`` He pulled me out , he said , ` Do n't nobody love you but me , not your mama , not your daddy , and especially not B. ' '' The recording of the song was so emotional for Rowland that it took her around ten takes to lay down her vocals without crying .
`` It was very emotional .
It took me days to record , '' she told Billboard magazine .
`` I had to get past being so upset and actually sing the song , not sob through it .
I always hope that my music can inspire someone , the same way other artists inspire me .
Dream said , ' I want to write you a record so that people will know exactly who you are , underneath it all . ' ''
So what does Beyoncé think of the song ?
Speaking with Washington radio station 93.9 WKYS , Rowland said that Bey 's response was endearing , telling Rowland that she `` never left '' her side .
`` She heard how real I was and was like ` I 'm so proud of you , ' '' Kelly explained .
Rowland told Fader magazine that she had a personal conversation with The-Dream , which led to them writing this song .
`` I was like , ` wait a minute , this is personal ! '
He 's just like , ` People go through this every day .
Everybody has their version of their dirty laundry and it allows people to get to know you more .
Is that a bad thing ? '
You sit there and you 're wondering what people are going to say , but in that moment after I sang it I did n't care .
For me it was therapeutic .
I felt lighter . ''
The track was penned by The-Dream , who compiled the lyrics from different personal stories that Rowland shared .
The hitmaker told Billboard magazine that he had to `` push '' Rowland to go outside her comfort zone .
`` What unfolds on TV or on the Internet , it 's never really that .
You think it is but it 's just not , '' he said .
`` When you have a stage like Kelly has , you should talk about that part of your life .
I think Kelly 's way deeper than that .
`` Rowland also teamed up with The-Dream on `` Where Have You Been ? ''
a track off the latter 's IV Play album .
The phrase ` dirty laundry ' is used to describe someone 's secrets that they do n't want anyone to find out about .
Don Henley of The Eagles had a solo hit single with the same title .
His tune had the subject matter of unscrupulous journalists prying into his personal life and doing anything for a story .
The fact that Rowland got to a place where she felt able to perform the song is enough of an accomplishment for The-Dream .
`` The first time we did it I was like , ' I know this is n't a song you sing , but I 'd rather you feel this than to hit the notes you need to hit . '
I had no idea how talented she was at vocals , and she just drove it out there , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` Forget the rest of it , about the business and all that .
Just knowing she feels and felt was great enough for me , even if nobody heard the record .
It 's an Earth-stopper .
It 's going to take a couple weeks for people to let it soak in . ''
