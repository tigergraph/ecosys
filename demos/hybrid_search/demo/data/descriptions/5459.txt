`` I can be in a dream and know that I 'm dreaming , '' Deheza explained in an interview on National Public Radio -LRB- NPR -RRB- , `` so I 'll know that I can pretty much make anything happen .
I 'll know that everything that 's there is out of my head , so I can make somebody appear , or if I want to go somewhere else , I can do that , too .
It 's pretty much having control of what you see . ''
Benjamin Curtis passed away on December 29 , 2013 aged 35 .
