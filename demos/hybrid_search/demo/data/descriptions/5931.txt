Bassist Dave Ellefson commented to MusicRadar.com regarding frontman Dave Mustaine 's lyrics for this song : `` This has one of the wittiest and funniest set of lyrics .
I know Dave 's words are sometimes kind of dark , but Wrecker represents more of the humorous side to him . ''
Ellefson called the riff `` massive , '' saying : `` It 's one of those parts where the whole band just rallied around and dug in and blew the house down .
Some riffs are good , others are great , and then there 's riffs that just rock your world .
` Wrecker ' is the last example . ''
