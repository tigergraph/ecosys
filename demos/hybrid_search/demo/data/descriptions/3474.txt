This song about losing yourself in someone else was a track on American alternative rock band Mazzy Star 's second album , So Tonight That I Might See .
The set also features Mazzy Star 's best known track , their transatlantic Top 50 hit `` Fade Into You . ''
This song has featured three times in the American teen drama series The OC , most prominently when it was the outro song in the episode where Marissa overdoses in Mexico .
The tune also featured in the House third season episode , Informed Consent .
The song was featured in a 2009 TV advertising campaign for Virgin Media in the UK .
