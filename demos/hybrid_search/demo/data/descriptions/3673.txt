This lighthearted study of a perceived mid-life crisis was inspired by onlookers ' reactions to the 27-year age gap between Paul Weller and his wife Hannah .
The singer explained on his website : `` There was an inference that I was going through a mid-life crisis , which I found really amusing : the clich√©d notion of it .
That was the impetus for -LRB- the song -RRB- even though it is n't really about that .
It 's a bit tongue in cheek , too .
I guess it 's also about how society views people of a certain age .
For me , does it really matter what age you are ?
It 's what up there in your soul that matters . ''
