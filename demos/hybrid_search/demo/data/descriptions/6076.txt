`` Minnie the Moocher '' was written by the famous band leader , jazz composer and singer Cabell `` Cab '' Calloway III , and the Jazz music publisher Irving Mills .
It was first recorded in 1931 by Cab Calloway and His Orchestra , and became their signature song for the next decade .
Beloved by audiences , `` Minnie the Moocher '' earned Calloway the nickname `` The Hi De Hi De Hi Man '' based on his unique form of scatting in the song .
In fact , the song was so popular that it came in at # 1 in the US Billboard singles charts for seventeen weeks in 1931 .
`` Minnie the Moocher '' tells the sad story of a `` red hot hoochie coocher '' girl called Minnie .
The hoochie coochie was a style of belly dancing with non-respectable gypsy origins , and was considered lecherous at the time .
The licentious Minnie gets involved with a `` kokie '' conveniently called Smokey , a `` kokie '' being someone who takes cocaine .
Kokie takes her down to Chinatown where he introduces her to opium , which is what Calloway meant when using the jive expression `` to kick the gong around '' in the lyrics .
The rest of the song describes her opium-induced wish-fulfilment fantasy in which the king of Sweden gives her many gifts , including `` a diamond car , with the puh-latinum wheels . ''
Calloway does n't tell us how this story ends , but he does wail `` Poor Min !
Poor Min '' Poo-oor Min '' at the end , which may be an indication that Minnie 's a goner .
`` Minnie the Moocher '' has very strong musical and lyric similarities with a contemporary song called `` Willie the Weeper , '' written in 1927 by the singer and Frankie `` Half-Pint '' Jaxon .
The song has been recorded and performed most notoriously by Billy Walker , Louis Armstrong and Dave van Ronk .
`` Willie the Weeper '' is also about drug addiction and an ensuing dream , but instead of the king of Sweden , Willie dreams of his adventures with the Queen of Sheba , Cleopatra , and the sultan of Turkey .
Irving Mills openly quoted lyrics from the song when he said that Minnie `` had a million dollars in nickels and dimes ; she sat around and counted it all , a million times , '' whilst Willie also `` had a million dollars , all in nickels and dimes ... Well he knew it 'cause he 'd counted them a million times . ''
In 1999 `` Minnie the Moocher '' was given a Grammy Hall of Fame Award .
Having written a dictionary of the Harlem patois in 1944 -LRB- The New Cab Calloway Hipster 's Dictionary : Language of Jive -RRB- and highly enthusiastic about the subject , `` Minnie the Moocher '' was riddled with jive slang white audiences of the time would not have recognized the meaning of .
So , despite `` Minnie the Moocher '' being quite a sordid tale , the song was not censored and reached very wide audiences , selling more than a million copies .
The thing that made this song so special to audiences was the call-and-response scat battle that Calloway used to engage them in when performing this song at the Cotton Club and other famous jazz nightclubs in Chicago .
He would start off with `` He De Hi De Hi De Hi , '' and simple variations , which the audience could repeat back easily , but then his scats would get steadily more difficult until finally he would give them a `` Skeedle-a-booka-diki biki skeedly beeka gookity woop ! ''
to respond to , leaving most people far behind in fits of laughter .
This form of scatting became Calloway 's trademark , and he wrote many more songs in a similar vein , including `` The Hi-De-Ho Miracle Man , '' and `` You Got ta Hi-De-Ho . ''
In 1932 Calloway 's music and dance steps were used in a Talkartoon short cartoon with Betty Boop entitled Minnie the Moocher , where his movements were transformed into those of a ghostly singing walrus through the technique of rotoscoping .
At the beginning of the short , he is filmed dancing to the introduction of the song , and this is the earliest existing recorded footage of Calloway .
Calloway 's performance of `` Minnie the Moocher '' in the classic 1980 film Blues Brothers , directed by John Landis , was his final movie appearance , although he lived for another 14 years and kept on performing right to the end .
Calloway 's scene was a highlight of the film , although we find it hard to choose between `` Minnie '' and Aretha Franklin 's spirited performance of `` Think .
`` Both these scenes came as a pleasant surprise , like a distantly-recalled memory of a song you once knew , but had forgotten all about .
For some , it was an all-important first exposure to a musical heritage never to be repeated .
In the film , Calloway appears at the climax and saves the Blues Brothers ' gig , for which they are late , having run into some trouble with the law .
He stalls the audience by entertaining them with a little `` He-De-Hi-De-Hi . ''
It 's a point in the movie in which it becomes difficult to suppress a child-like feeling of glee , a definite high point .
