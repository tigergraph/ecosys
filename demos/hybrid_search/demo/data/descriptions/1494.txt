Foals kick off their third album Holy Fire with this instrumental .
Their vocalist Yannis Philippakis told NME : `` We all got entranced by the groove : we 've got these recordings where it 's 25 minutes long , because there 's just something really cyclical about the loop .
We just wanted it on the record and that evoked a lot of that swampiness and there 's a menace in it .
Plus it cleans the palette , it burns away , it allows the record to start fresh . ''
Several Holy Fire tracks including this one feature the sound of bees in the mix .
The buzzing noise of the honey-producing insects was recorded Down Under with Australian musician Jono Ma long before the London sessions for the album with Flood and Alan Moulder .
Philippakis told NME : `` There 's something sonically incredible about the way bees sound .
Its fu -- ing great .
Also , we recorded some stuff in Australia with Jono Ma - he set up some mics outside , there was insect life everywhere getting recorded as we did vocal takes .
I wanted that swampy .
organic prescience .
And Bees ' fates are inextricably linked with our own .
Its such a cataclysmic event -LRB- their decline -RRB- but its tiny -LRB- in comparative scale to humans -RRB- .
I like the fact that its this tiny thing but its huge .
A weird double perspective . ''
