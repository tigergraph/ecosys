For this song , Lizz Wright was inspired by 1980s British band The Smiths .
The Georgia-born singer told Mojo magazine May 2008 : `` I was introduced to The Smiths and fell in love with the singer 's voice and their writing .
John Eventual -LRB- her co-writer -RRB- gave me this track he knew had nothing to do with the record I was making and said , ' I just want to hear your response . '
We finished it and it ended up on the album . ''
In the same interview Wright discussed the album .
She said : `` I really wanted to make a record about home .
The title refers to a pecan orchard that 's been in my family for years .
It 's watched a couple of generations grow up so it reminds me of my home and family . ''
