This piano ballad finds a heartbroken Adam Levine scared that the relationship is ending .
He sings of his personal anguish and regret for being such a jerk .
`` And I confess that I 'm only holding on by a thin , thin thread , I 'm so sad , '' Levine croons .
The vocalist penned the song with James Valentine , which was just one of four credits on Overexposed for Levine 's usual co-writer and lead guitarist .
The song was covered by Amber Carrington on NBC 's The Voice in 2013 .
Her version landed at # 92 on the Hot 100 after she sung it in the semi-finals .
Valentine started composing the song on his piano at home , before introducing the melody to Levine .
He recalled to Ultimate-Guitar .
com : `` I had woken up one morning and before I was even awake I was at my piano in my living room and I played this thing .
It was kinda cool and like the chords to the verse and I just sang that melody .
I sang that melody and there were n't any words ; it was just kind of a melody .
I recorded it on my phone and did n't even think about it .
I went into the studio and Adam sort of had this concept for a song ; he had a couple of the lines that would be the chorus . ''
