This is one of three tracks on Come to Life where Coldplay 's Chris Martin has a songwriting credit .
As a long-time Coldplay fan who attended many of the band 's early London shows , Imbruglia was thrilled to work with Martin .
She told The Daily Mirror Sept 25 , 2009 : `` It 's one thing being a fan of someone , quite another to find yourself in a studio songwriting session with them .
It was quite intimidating but wonderful too .
He 's got a thousand ideas pouring through him all the time and it 's a buzz to be around that sort of energy.He helped me rewrite one of the songs which has become the first single -LRB- `` Want '' -RRB- , and gave me a song called ` Fun ' which is one of the most beautiful I 've ever heard .
He told me it was unfinished , but then he heard my album and finished it for me .
It 's one of the best things he 's written . ''
