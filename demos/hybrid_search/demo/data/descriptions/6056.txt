This song was inspired by the Occupy movement and the band 's political frustration .
Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong told NME it , `` deals with everything , not just lefties but it goes all the way up to cops and firemen and unions , and that 's where we come from , the working class .
It 's in our DNA . ''
The song title comes from the movement 's slogan We are the 99 % , a reference to the concentration of wealth among the top 1 % of income earners compared to the other 99 percent .
Armstrong admitted to Rolling Stone , `` I feel like a 99 , but technically I 'm a 1 .
You know , -LSB- '99 Revolutions ' -RSB- was an easy song to write .
I know that 's where I come from - the 99 - even though I can afford for my kids to go to a good college . ''
Armstrong and his bandmates have been participating in the protests in Oakland since 2011 .
`` We wanted to be part of it in some way , '' the frontman explained to Rolling Stone .
`` I thought it was about working people and where we come from .
But Oakland got really complicated when the anarchists started coming in .
I 'm not into that - smashing the windows in a small business . ''
