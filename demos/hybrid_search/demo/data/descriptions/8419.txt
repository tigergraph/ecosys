This is a single and the one original composition from A Christmas Cornucopia , Scottish singer-songwriter Annie Lennox ' first Christmas album .
The singer donated all the royalties from this song to The Annie Lennox Foundation .
This song marked Lennox 's first new material since 2007 's Songs of Mass Destruction .
However , in an interview with Spinner the Scottish singer explained she was n't planning on writing a new song for A Christmas Cornucopia : `` I was planning on recording these carols , but one day , I had a title that had been going around in my mind , ` Universal Child , ' and I was like ` what is that ? '
During a break , I was playing on a keyboard and all of a sudden , some chords came and a melody .
It 's like a chicken laying an egg . ''
Lennox explained the inspiration behind this song : `` It 's really strange .
I had n't been writing any songs for a long time .
Then this title popped into my head -- I did n't even know it was a title .
It was just two words ... Safety , security , access to medical care , to love , protection , education , a future , a decent place to live -- a child must have all these things .
In the Western countries this tends to be taken for granted .
In developing countries it 's a different story.The abuse of children is just ... everywhere , '' she added with a shake of her head .
`` It truly is .
I 've been to rape crisis centers , I know what 's going on . ''
Lennox was herself a Christmas child .
She was born on December 25 , 1954 .
