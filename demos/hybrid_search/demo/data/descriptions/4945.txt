Staind guitarist Mike Mushok discussed his vision for the song in a interview with Artist Direct 's Rick Florino : `` Initially , that was something completely different musically .
That 's the one song on the record like that .
It was really heavy .
It sounded like a riff that could 've been off of Paranoid .
It was this real low Black Sabbath-style riff that went into this arpeggiated chord part .
Everybody loved the heavy riff , but -LRB- bass player -RRB- Johnny K came back and said , ` Everything Aaron -LRB- Lewis -RRB- sings on it sounds bluesy .
It does n't really fit with the way the riff is . '
I was like , ` Let 's rewrite it . '
We rewrote the verse first , and we ended up rewriting pretty much the entire song .
We originally tried to keep the same riff in there as the intro .
It was probably my favorite music .
However , the intro riff we loved to begin with did n't really fit anymore .
It felt out of place with the chorus and the bridge idea .
We came back after the weekend and we had to come up with something else for it .
We came up with that intro riff now . ''
The band came close to imploding while creating the Staind album , and at one point Aaron Lewis and Mushok were barely speaking to one another .
Mushok told Artist Direct : '' ` Paper Wings ' was the song that probably caused the biggest rift between Aaron and me .
He took the bridge and made it the verse .
He made the outro a pre-chorus .
It got down to the end , and that 's the way the song stayed .
He loved the bridge and wanted to sing over that as the verse .
It 's cool the way it is , but that song took a minute there to figure out .
We have this whole other song that we never ended up even using though . ''
