This robo-pop R&B duet with Will.I.Am from the Black Eyed Peas is the title track of Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Cole 's debut solo album .
It is also the second single from the LP .
Cole previously collaborated with Will.I.Am on a re-mixed version of his 2007 track , `` Heartbreaker , '' which was a # 4 hit in the UK .
Cole said in a promotional video that this is her favourite song on the album , adding that it was `` totally different from anything I 've done -LSB- with Girls Aloud -RSB- or liked before . ''
This is one of four tracks on 3 Words , which are Cole/Will .
I.Am collaborations .
She explained in publicity materials that after she guested on `` Heartbreaker : '' `` We became friends and he said he was interested in working with me again .
It was a massive compliment but I did n't even register it , really .
I was working hard with the Girls .
They were my complete focus . ' ''
After Girls Aloud finished their Out of Control Tour , Cole 's record company asked if she was interested in Will.I.Am 's offer and so the singer decided to take some time out to work with him in the studio .
She explained : ` The way we work with Girls Aloud is that we 'll go into the vocal booth and do our lines on a track that 's already almost completed .
With Will I was seeing music being made right from the ground up .
He 'd ask my opinion on the beats and the words .
He 'd send me off to write hooks . '
`` The recording process gathered momentum after Will and Cheryl had alighted on this song , which became the album 's title track .
Said Cole : `` I still ca n't quite believe that that song is mine .
Right from the start with this I knew what I would n't sing .
If I heard a thumping dance beat or a phrase I would n't use , it 'd go .
If I was going to make a solo record it had to be a record that I 'd play in the house .
I love what the Girls do .
I love the quirkiness and I love that it is our sound .
But this time it had to be personal . ''
