This song sounds like it might be about an overbearing parent or authority figure .
On some of their tour dates opening for Evanescence in 2004 , lead singer Adam Gontier introduced the song by saying , `` This song is about someone trying to change you , until you say , ` Hey , f -- k off and leave me alone ! ' ''
