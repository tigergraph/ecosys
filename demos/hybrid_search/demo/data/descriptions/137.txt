This is a track from Seattle post-grunge band Candlebox 's fifth studio album , Love Stories & Other Musings .
Candlebox frontman Kevin Martin told Artist Direct : `` It 's inspired by what my job does , where it takes me , and how far it takes me away from my family . ''
Martin penned the song in the dining room at his apartment .
He told Artist Direct : `` I was kicking around some simple guitar patterns .
I tried to simplify the songwriting on this record a lot more .
It was more about melodies than it was about construction .
Music is music .
It 's everywhere , and you can grab it when it 's ready .
In all honesty , it 's my favorite song on the record .
I love how the song starts with the drum beat .
It 's very Americana . ''
