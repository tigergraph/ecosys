`` Sulk '' was the last track on The Bends to be completed .
According to Q magazine April 2008 this was mainly because of Yorke 's concern that the song 's original lyric , which contained the line `` just shoot your gun , '' might be taken as a crude cash-in on the suicide of Kurt Cobain .
Thom Yorke originally wrote `` Sulk '' in 1987 as a response to suicidal gunman Michael Ryan 's shooting spree in Hungerford , in which he killed 16 people .
During a final recording session for The Bends , Radiohead revisited the song .
