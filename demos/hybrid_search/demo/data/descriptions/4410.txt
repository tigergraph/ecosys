The song was recorded in early 2013 at ICP studios in Brussels , Belgium , as part of the Big TV album sessions .
It was produced by Ed Buller -LRB- Suede , Pulp -RRB- and mixed by Mark ` Spike ' Stent .
The track got the band excited -- `` it might be the most immediate White Lies song we 've written , '' said vocalist Harry McVeigh to NME shortly after laying it down .
Cave told The Sun regarding the song : `` This is where the anti-heroine is trying to mend her relationship with someone in her home town .
Her reasoning is desperate and weak and I think this is a common story . ''
The Big TV album follows the adventures of an Eastern European girl hunting down her absentee father in a vast metropolis .
This song finds the female arguing with her boyfriend back home about her constant drifting .
Bassist and lyricist Charles Cave told NME : `` That 's the boyfriend 's point of view of her -- he 's fed up hearing the same old excuses . ''
