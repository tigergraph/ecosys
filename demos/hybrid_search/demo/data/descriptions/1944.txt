Vanessa Carlton was experiencing some serious health problems when she started writing the songs for Rabbits On The Run .
This song was inspired by her lack of physical well being at the time .
She told American Songwriter magazine : `` I had handed myself over to western doctors and it was a mistake .
The song ` Hear the Bells ' is the story of a person navigating their recovery , and making many stops along the way ... angry winter walks through the city , meditating in a church cemetery , floating on the sea with lots of wine in you in Costa Rica , finding a Chinese witchdoctor ... until you realize the remedy was pretty much there all along .
Though I still float on seas and I boil my Chinese herbs every morning . ''
