`` Lovin ' , Touchin ' , Squeezin ' '' was written by lead singer Steve Perry .
It 's a gut-wrenching tale of love-gone-wrong , with the desperate opening lines , `` You make me weep , I wan na die , '' and an extended fade of `` na na `` s , as there are no more words to describe the pain .
Perry did n't make this stuff up : according to the liner notes for Journey 's Time3 compilation , this was a true story .
He watched through the window as his girlfriend at the time got out of a Corvette and gave the driver a long , loving kiss goodbye .
He calls this song `` love justice . ''
Interesting to note that Journey showed a steady progress in the album charts towards their # 1 charting album , unlike bands who meander around before peaking their fame .
In chronological order , the studio albums go : Journey , # 138 , Look into the Future , # 100 , Next , # 85 , Infinity , # 21 , Evolution , # 20 , Departure , # 8 , and Escape , # 1 .
That means that from 1975 to 1981 , they steadily gained ground releasing one album per year , apparently always better than the one before .
Plus , the # 1 broke the pattern .
`` Lovin ' , Touchin ' , Squeezin ' '' appears in the pilot episode of the FOX TV series Glee , first broadcast after American Idol on May 19 , 2009 .
This is the highest-charting single from Journey 's fifth studio album , and the group 's first-ever single to break into the top-20 , although they had already established themselves as a headlining live act .
Progressive metal band Dream Theater sampled this song in `` The Big Medley '' on their 1995 album A Change of Seasons .
Sharing this distinction are Pink Floyd 's `` In the Flesh ?
, '' Kansas ' `` Carry On Wayward Son , '' Queen 's `` Bohemian Rhapsody , '' Dixie Dregs ' `` Cruise Control , '' and Genesis ' `` Turn It on Again '' - yes , that 's all one song !
