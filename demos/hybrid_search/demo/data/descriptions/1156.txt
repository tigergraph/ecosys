When Madonna was 6 years old , her mother died of breast cancer .
She told Q magazine that this song was a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on .
Madonna added that she had been searching for a reason for her existence since the loss of her mother .
The superstar reflected : `` Most people ask it , but they do n't dwell on it .
Do n't you really want to know why you 're here ?
Do you really think that life is just about being born , making lots of money , finding someone to have kids with , then dying ? ''
In August 2005 the Rauhofer mix of this track peaked at # 9 on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play chart .
This was Madonna 's 7th Top 10 hit from the American Life album on that chart , the most Top 10 entries any recording artist has ever had on that listing .
