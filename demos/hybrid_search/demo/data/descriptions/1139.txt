This acoustic murder ballad from the Long Live The King EP tells the story of Edgar Watson , who was accused of killing several people in the late 1800s .
He fled to Chokoloskee in Florida , which had had a reputation as being a refuge for outlaws and was eventually killed by a crowd shortly after the Southwest Florida Hurricane of 1910 .
American novelist Peter Matthiessen immortalized his story in a 1990s novel trilogy .
The song features harmonies by singer-songwriter Laura Veirs and singer/violinist Annalisa Tornfelt of post bluegrass band Bearfoot , who are both friends of The Decemberists .
