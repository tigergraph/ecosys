Stevie Nicks found storytelling inspiration in a variety of places for her In Your Dreams album .
This gothic ballad , for instance , was started off by her in the mid - '70s about her relationship with Lindsey Buckingham but finished after seeing the Twilight : New Moon film in 2009 .
She explained to Spinner UK : `` The first and the third verse in ` Moonlight ' were written in the mid - '70s .
The second verse - ` She 's lonely , lost , and disconnected ' - was written in Brisbane right after I saw the movie .
So the song , really , is ancient times up to today.The chorus - ` It 's strange , she runs from the ones she ca n't keep up with ' - is all about the love affair between Bella and Edward -LSB- in Twilight : New Moon -RSB- .
But ` Some call her strange lady from the mountains/Others say she 's not really real , ' that 's written in 1976 .
The same with the third verse : ` He loves her , but he loves his life alone as well ' -- people would think that was written about Edward , but it was written about Lindsey .
So this really is an ancient song that encompasses my strange and everlasting relationship with Lindsey Buckingham , and Bella and Edward , all mixed into one . ''
Nicks told Spinner UK how her relationship with Buckingham could be called `` vampiric . ''
She explained : `` As much as we fight and have our differences of opinion on almost everything , if anything were to happen to either of us , I would be the first one there and he would be the first one here .
So it is a story about how love never dies . ''
