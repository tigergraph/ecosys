Frontman Wayne Coyne told Uncut magazine June 2008 about this song : `` Halloween on the Barbary Coast summed up where we were during Hit to Death in the Future Head .
Back in the late '80s , we would go to Vegas a lot .
We never had any money , but as were driving through we would stop and gamble away 20 bucks .
If we were lucky , we 'd win 100 bucks and we 'd spend it all just having a kind of experience .
We walked into this one casino called the Barbary Coast .
There was a strike going on and there was a picket line .
At the time we were dyeing our hair and clothes black .
You 've got to remember , we would n't wash our clothes .
They 'd be dyed black the day that we left for a tour and we 'd wear them for three months .
The dye would get all over you , little by little , and we 'd all look slightly greyish .
We walked up to this picket line , this guy said , ` Look at this , it 's Halloween at the Barbary Coast . '
We never realized what a strange , ghoulish-looking gang we were until someone said that .
Here 's the middle of summer and we 're dressed in black .
Everybody does that now .
Back then , we were trying to look like weirdoes , and so we probably did to this group of union workers on strike .
Plus it sounded like one of our song-titles . ''
