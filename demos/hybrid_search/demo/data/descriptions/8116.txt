You do n't always need words to send a message : this instrumental song has political influence all over it .
In 2012 , guitarist Pete Holmstrom told us that the title of this song was inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement of 2011 .
Holmstrom explained that the original title was just `` Power to the People , '' but `` since all the Occupy Wall Street stuff was going on , it was really hard to tell if that was effective .
So the `` Alternative '' was added . ''
At one point , lead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor wanted to create a video for this song that would drive home the political message .
The idea was to show him with tape over his mouth , green-screened over a background of footage of political turmoil .
The lead parts to this song were created using a unique keyboard trick .
The Dandys first used the trick on their cover of Frankie Goes to Hollywood 's `` Relax , '' with two people needed to pull it off .
For this song , lead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor worked out how to play the part with only one person , and guitarist Pete Holmstrom says Taylor-Taylor does it `` to better effect .
