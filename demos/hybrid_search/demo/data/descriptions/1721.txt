A song about spending all the hours of the night with a woman , never wanting it to end , and the feelings that come when you fall in love .
Feeling like dancing , feeling like telling her everything that 's on your mind , feeling like you do n't know if your right side up or upside down , feeling like driving till morning comes .
It does n't have to be a woman , it can be about love for anyone .
