Chesney told Newsweek about this self-penned song , which he wrote in the aftermath of the breakdown of his four month marriage to Hollywood actress Renée Zellweger : `` In 2006 , I was probably as emotionally and mentally exhausted as I 'd ever been .
And that was due to a lot of things - having the foot on the gas pedal constantly , and my break-up with Renée Zellweger .
I got in a plane and went down to the Virgin Islands .
I was completely by myself .
I did n't want to be around anybody .
So the next thing you know , it 's me and a pen and I sat down and wrote a lot of lines of this song , ` Nowhere to Go , Nowhere to Be . ' ''
Newsweek asked Chesney if he was worried about writing about his break-up with Renée .
He replied : `` It 's the truth .
It 's my life .
I 've been in a lot of states of mind in the last three years .
In that way , it 's a pretty honest record .
I 've let myself be more emotionally vulnerable in some of the lyrics .
I think that was good therapy . ''
