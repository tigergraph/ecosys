Lead singer Tyler Glenn claims that `` Our War '' is his favorite track on Habits .
The song is a heartbreaking plea to a girl he dated for two years .
He even prepared for marriage by asking his aunt for a family heirloom ring .
The song traces the day things started to fall apart , when the couple were supposed to take a trip to Salt Lake City .
`` I was at a bus stop waiting in the rain all day , '' he says .
`` I walked all day in the rain .
Looking back on it , it felt cinematic .
But since then it 's bottled up and made me not trust .
Maybe the whole next Neon Trees album will be more angry . ''
