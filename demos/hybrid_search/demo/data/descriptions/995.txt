Villagers mainman Conor O'Brien first wrote this song during his time with Irish avant garde rock quartet The Immediate in the mid-2000s , and it subsequently evolved into the version that can be heard on -LRB- Awayland -RRB- .
He explained to WhiteTapes : `` In the song I 'm trying to give the expression of things that language ca n't express and I wanted to use language to describe that , which does n't make sense but I wanted to try and talk about those moments ... whether it 's physical violent action or sex or death , stuff that you ca n't , physically , put into words , really .
That 's what the song 's about .
It like ` off goes the bell , ringing through my head , signifies that 's all 's been said . '
It was an experiment .
Before the Villagers ' version I listened to lots of Bossanova stuff .
The song used to have different chords .
One of the lyrics I stole from my time from The Immediate is ` center of my skin ' etc. .
We released the song and we ca n't go back now . ''
