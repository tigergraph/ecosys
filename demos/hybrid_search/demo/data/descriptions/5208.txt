Between the release of Carpenter 's 2010 album The Age Of Miracles and 2012 's Ashes and Roses , the singer-songwriter was forced to endure her share of changes , thanks to the ending of her marriage and the death of her father .
This revealing slice of Carpenter 's life finds her reflecting on her future .
`` It 's a song I wrote when I was thinking about where I wanted to place myself next , '' she explained to Billboard magazine .
`` I was n't sure I wanted to stay where I had been living .
I felt there would be a place where I could find home again .
To all of us , it 's the thing that grounds us the most , and at the same time , I had recently lost my father .
So , it speaks to that spiritual place where you feel that even thought someone has passed on , you will always be connected .
There 's comfort there .
It was coinciding with a search on my part for a new place to live in my heart literally and spiritually .
So , there 's a lot going on in that song . ''
