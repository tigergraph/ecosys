Lead guitarist Mick Whitnall told NME that he was delighted with vocalist Peter Doherty 's contribution to this song : `` When we recorded that I was so impressed and proud of Peter , '' he said .
`` I swear to God , he did about 15 takes back to back .
He was really pushing it .
He came out of the vocal booth and he was wet through , and he says , ` My ears are like two lamb cutlets ! '
cos he 'd had the headphones on .
But honestly , his voice !
My missus -- whose opinion I respect -- she was like , ` Oh my god , it sounds like he can actually sing ! ' ''
