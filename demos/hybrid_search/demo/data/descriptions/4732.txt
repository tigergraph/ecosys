This song finds Ocean pouring his heart to a cab driver over a plaintive organ .
As they travel the city at dawn he sings of an unrequited love , with the twist of the love being a `` him '' and not a `` her . ''
The use of the masculine pronoun caused early listeners to question whether the singer was in fact detailing a relationship with a guy .
As a result Ocean took to his Tumblr page to address the speculation and shared details of falling in love with a man .
`` 4 summers ago , I met somebody .
I was 19 years old , '' he wrote .
`` He was too .
We spent that summer , and the summer after , together .
Every day almost , and on the day we were together , time would glide .
Most of the day I 'd see him , and his smile .
By the time I realized I was in love , it was malignant .
It was hopeless .
`` Ocean went on to explain that he shared his feelings with the man , who was in a relationship with a girl at the time .
Though his pal did n't reciprocate his attraction , they maintained their friendship .
Ocean performed the song on television for the first time during the July 10 , 2012 Late Night With Jimmy Fallon show .
