This song is about Michigan ; Anthony Kiedis ' home state .
The line , `` Lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck '' refers to the Detroit Lions football team and the Detroit Tigers baseball team , and how almost every year they do very poorly .
Omar Rodriguez-Lopez of The Mars Volta makes a guest appearance on this song , playing the guitar solo .
RHCP 's Flea and John Frusciante have been featured on Mars Volta songs in the past .
More lyrical analysis : `` A mitten full of fisherman '' - Because of its surroundings being the Great Lakes , many fisherman either live or vacation in Michigan .
The `` mitten '' is a reference to the shape of the state of Michigan .
`` A rainy Lithuanian is dancing like an Indian '' - Anthony Kiedis ' grandfather was from Lithuania , and his grandmother had some Indian heritage from the Mahican tribe .
The Lithuanian is rainy because of the rain-filled climate of Lithuania , and is dancing like an Indian , because he is married to an Indian .
Anthony Kiedis has mentioned his Indian heritage many times .
This was originally just going to be left off of the album , and just be a B-Side .
