London born and Jersey reared singer-songwriter Nerina Pallot penned this song after sobbing at TV footage of parents who had lost loved ones in Iraq .
Talking of that song during an interview with the BBC , she said `` there 's a human sadness and tragedy at the heart of -LSB- war -RSB- .
And that 's what I was trying to describe in the song - loss .
The senseless loss of young lives . ''
Regarding whether there was a thematic link between that and her breakthrough hit single , the anti-war song `` Everybody 's Gone to War , '' Pallot told the BBC that `` on a personal level , I feel less angry , more sad . ''
