Grimes is the alter-ego of Vancouver-born one-woman band Claire Boucher .
The waif-like songstress originally moved to Montreal to attend McGill University , where she became involved with the underground electronic and industrial music scene and met her now-manager and engineer Sebastian Cowan .
She began making music in 2010 , with two albums on local label Arbutus , but it was when this song began circulating as a mp3 in October 2011 that critics began getting interested .
The tune soon became a major highlight of Boucher 's live sets and it was released as a single on January 31 , 2012 .
The music video was directed by Emily Kai Bock and shot in Montreal at the Olympic Stadium and at McGill University 's Molson Stadium .
It finds Grimes dancing and singing amongst spectators , shirtless frat boys , as well as in a men 's locker room surrounded by cartoonish masculine athletes .
`` Art gives me an outlet where I can be aggressive in a world where I usually ca n't be , '' she told Pitchfork , `` and part of it was asserting this abstract female power in these male-dominated arenas . ''
The creepy lyrics hint at nighttime violence .
Boucher explained to Spin magazine that `` the song 's sort of about being - I was assaulted and I had a really hard time engaging in any types of relationship with men , because I was just so terrified of men for a while . ''
This was voted # 1 in Pitchfork 's list of Top 100 Tracks of 2012 .
