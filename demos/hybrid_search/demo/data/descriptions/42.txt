This is the opening track from American pop punk band Motion City Soundtrack 's fourth studio album , My Dinosaur Life .
Frontman Justin Pierre told the story of the song to Alternative Press : `` The basic outline of this song came to me one night while I was wandering around my apartment with an acoustic guitar .
I wrote almost all of the words in one sitting , and it seemed to me that this song was destined to be the opening track .
Its purpose was to pick up where -LSB- 2007 's Even If It Kills Me -RSB- ended and set out an outline or course of what is yet to come .
I went through a rough patch or two , but came out okay on the other side .
This song is about staying positive .
To be self-congratulatory defeats any act of accomplishment , therefore I had to ; it made me laugh .
Try as I might to be serious , I can not resist the tongue-in-cheek . ''
