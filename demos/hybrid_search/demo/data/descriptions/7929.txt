Bowie explained on the VH1 Storytellers series that he penned this song as a prayer to see him through the period when a debilitating coke addiction had him flirting with fascism and black magic .
Bowie said it was `` a call for help . ''
In 1980 , Bowie told NME that he believes he was blinkered by religion around the time he wrote this song : `` There was a point when I very nearly got suckered into that narrow sort of looking ... finding the cross as the salvation of mankind . ''
Bowie told the NME that the crunch point came when he was filming the Nicholas Roeg film , The Man Who Fell to Earth .
Said the Thin White Duke : `` There were days of such psychological terror when making the Roeg film that I nearly started to approach my reborn , born again thing .
It was the first time I 'd really seriously thought about Christ and God in any depth , and ` Word on a Wing ' was a protection .
It did come as a complete revolt against elements that I found in the film .
The passion in the song was genuine ... something I needed to produce from within myself to safeguard myself against some of the situations I felt were happening on the film set . ''
His cocaine addiction was so severe during its recording that nowadays , Bowie is unable to remember making Station To Station .
