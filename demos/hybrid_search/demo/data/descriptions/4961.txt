This is the title track from American singer-songwriter and guitarist M. Ward 's seventh album .
A Wasteland Companion was recorded in eight studios in the United States and the United Kingdom and released on April 10 , 2012 .
The song and album title alludes to T.S. Elliot 's 1922 modernist poem , The Waste Land .
Ward explained to UK newspaper The Sun : `` I think Eliot would agree that a wasteland can be anywhere , anytime .
A companion is anything that gets you through it .
`` The Pet Shop Boys ' breakthrough hit `` West End Girls '' was also influenced by The Waste Land , according to their singer Neil Tennant .
