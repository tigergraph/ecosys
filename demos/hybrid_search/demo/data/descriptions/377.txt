After the success of Loudon Wainwright III 's `` Dead Skunk , '' Columbia Records was eager for another `` silly animal song '' to appeal to the public .
Much to their disappointment , the singer offered what he considered an even better , yet animal-free , song called `` The Swimming Song '' for his new album , Attempted Mustache.Although it did n't prove to be a bigger hit than `` Dead Skunk , '' the nostalgic song still remains one of Wainwright 's favorites .
Fans agree , even if their interpretations can go a little off-base -LRB- is it about alcoholism , drug addiction , falling in love , sex ?
Is it about growing old or dying young ? -RRB- .
According to Wainwright , it 's just a simple song about - you guessed it - swimming .
`` I was just thinking about swimming , but you know I mentioned , ` I 'm a self-destructive fool . '
For me , it 's just about the joy of swimming , '' he told the A.V. Club .
