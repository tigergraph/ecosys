Rucker penned this song with the American record producer and songwriter Frank Rogers -LRB- `` I 'm Gon na Miss Her -LRB- The Fishin ' Song -RRB- '' -RRB- .
He recalled on his record label 's website : `` After we wrote this , I said to Frank Rogers , ` Do you love your wife ? '
and he said , ` Yeah ! '
He said , ` Do you love your wife ? '
and I said ` Yeah ! '
You would think it was written by two guys who were n't too happy with their wives .
When we first started dating , my wife thought every song I wrote was about us .
When she heard this , I thought she was going to say , ` You want a divorce ? '
which is the last thing I want .
By the time we got to ` Leave Me Alone ' in the chorus , she was on the floor laughing .
Often you can write a song and only realize a few days later what it 's about .
There were a lot of people around me going through divorce -- that 's what triggered the idea . ''
