This electro pop tune , which features Japanese Baile Funk MC Tigarah , is a track from English alternative pop band Keane 's first EP , Night Train .
The band 's London-based manager Adam Tudhope described the record to Billboard magazine as `` a very eclectic collection of songs . ''
The song was originally recorded by Japanese electropop band Yellow Magic Orchestra .
Fancy giving their version a listen ?
It can be found on their 2003 collection UC YMO : Ultimate Collection of Yellow Magic Orchestra .
Vocalist Tom Chaplin told The Sunday Times April 26 , 2010 : `` We 've become more confident about taking an idea and running with it .
You have to do something radically different for people to even notice these days , and this EP is the high point of that spirit .
I want people to listen to Keane and be bewildered .
Some bands are so cynical in what they do - mentioning no names . ''
