This features country superstar Dolly Parton .
Emmylou Harris told The Sun June 6 , 2008 `` Dolly was finally able to come in towards the end of making the album , just before we had to shut down and mix it .
She got on her bus , drove all the way to Nashville , got there at night .
The next morning , she was there at 10 o'clock , completely bedazzling in red , and just nailed it . ''
