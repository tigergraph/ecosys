Drummer Nick Hodgson claimed to The News of the World that the Kaiser Chiefs contacted David Bowie through producer Tony Visconti and asked him for some help with some lyrics on this song .
Said Hodgson : `` Tony texted David asking for his suggestions to finish off a verse and he came up with a couple of lines .
I 'm such a big Bowie fan I ca n't believe I 'm saying this , but they just were n't right , so I 've missed out on a Hodgson/Bowie writing credit .
Gutted !
`` However , Visconti refuted the claims telling NME , `` I have never asked David Bowie to write lyrics for the Kaiser Chiefs .
I was hired for the production job because of Nick 's obsession with Bowie and T. Rex , and I freely shared some of my production secrets with them , but that did not include getting Bowie to write lyrics for them .
That is absurd . ''
