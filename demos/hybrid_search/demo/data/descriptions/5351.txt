This is about drummer Bob Burns leaving the band due to the stress of heavy touring .
After release of the album , Lynyrd Skynyrd started a 90-day 61-concert tour called `` The Torture Tour . ''
Ed King walked out during this tour .
Skynyrd is one band that 's familiar with hardship .
Al Kooper relates in his memoir Backstage Passes and Backstabbing Bastards that , while he was still in the early stages of taking over management of the band , Ronnie Van Zant phoned him at 2 a.m. .
This was to report the news that Lynyrd Skynyrd 's equipment van had been stolen .
They had a tour to fulfill and no equipment .
So Van Zant asked Kooper to wire them $ 5,000 on the spot .
Kooper immediately obliged , to which Van Zant remarked , `` Al , you just bought yourself a band for five thousand dollars ! ''
An acoustic version is featured on Lynyrd Skynyrd 's 1994 album Endangered Species .
