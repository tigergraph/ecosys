This is the third single and title track from former burlesque performer turned neo-soul vamp Paloma Faith 's debut album .
Faith explained the song to the Daily Echo : `` It 's a question to the public and the media because I think we live in a culture where the idea of being iconic has been lost .
I think the reason we do n't have any contemporary icons is because we know too much about people .
It 's about what you do n't know about these people and their mystery which makes them iconic .
When you look back at Marilyn Monroe she was an icon because she was always beautiful but there was a tragedy there .
None of us knew the ins and outs of what the tragedy was and that makes her iconic .
I think that 's something I miss in contemporary culture .
Leaving the mind to accept what we do n't know . ''
