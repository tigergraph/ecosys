Mac Miller begins his second album Watching Movies With The Sound Off with this cut , which deals with themes of self-sabotage concerning fame and his personal relationship .
Miller told Artist Direct the Star Room is a real place .
`` When we were growing up , '' he explained , `` it was a room that we used to do a lot of bad things in .
It was also a room of firsts .
It was a room of losing virginity . ''
Miller told Billboard magazine in a video track by track interview : `` I wanted to start the album off really honestly , the two voices , there 's a kinda self-conscious voice in my head and it 's like a different character that 's starting the album , a circus type event where a person comes out first who 's really weird and creepy and goes ` you do n't worry ' everyone 's going like ` who the f -- k is this dude ' and the curtain opens and the show starts .
That 's why the verse starts `` But me , I 'm still , '' because it 's like boom !
then to yourself and saying s -- t. ''
