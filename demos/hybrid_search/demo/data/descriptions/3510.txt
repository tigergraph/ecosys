Dolby included this track on his Amerikana EP , which was released to members of his fan club in June , 2010 .
The EP has a bluegrass feel , and Dolby told us that it 's `` pretty much a love letter back to America .
I really enjoyed the time that I spent living there .
And during the time I was there I got very fond of American roots music .
And so if you listen to the songs in that section , you 'll hear elements of folk and country and even bluegrass music in there .
But sung definitely in an English accent and with an English twist , sort of an ex-patriot British twist to it . ''

Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits played guitar on this track , which Dolby says is `` a song about a pair of hapless lovers and a jailbreak . ''
