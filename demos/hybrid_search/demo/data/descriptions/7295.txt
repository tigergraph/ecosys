This title track of the second studio album by English Synthpop duo Hurts finds the anguished singer Theo Hutchcraft comparing his heartbreak to that of an apocalypse .
Asked about the sound of the material , singer Theo Hutchcraft told NME : `` Dirtier .
Fuzzier .
Wilder .
`` Elaborating on the meaning behind the Exile title , Hutchcraft explained that he glimpsed it on a scrolling billboard while sitting in a bar in Osaka .
The word seemed to capture a slew of familiar emotions : '' -LSB- It 's -RSB- that sense of being in a weird place , '' he said .
`` Freedom , fear , isolation , joy , religion , punishment , the decadence that comes with exile -- always being on tour , always being far from home .
It did feel like we were on the run .
Always chasing something . ''
Hutchcraft explained to Digital Spy how the album title became a foundation for the album .
`` We had the title for the record before we wrote it , '' he said , `` so that made a huge impression on all of the songs .
Everything that comes with the word exile , we thought was a great starting point of emotions to express . ''
