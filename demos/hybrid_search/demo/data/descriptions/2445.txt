Adam `` King Ad-rock '' Horovitz talks about this song in the liner notes of the Beastie Boys anthology : `` Sabotage was recorded as an instrumental , and the vocals were n't added until two weeks before the record was completed .
It was the last song on Ill Communication to be finished . ''
Adam `` MCA '' Yauch recalled to Q magazine April 2008 how the video came about : `` Adam -LRB- Ad-Rock Horovitz -RRB- wanted us to do a photo shoot as undercover cops on a stake-out , sitting in a car , surrounded by coffee cups and doughnut wrappers .
We mentioned it to Spike and he said , ` Let 's do it ' . ''
The video , which was directed by Spike Jonze , was a parody of '70s cop shows such as CHiPs and Hawaii Five-0 .
It featured the 3 Beasties with shaggy hair and huge sunglasses , running around the city chasing a man with a briefcase and doing other cop stuff .
The video won several MTV awards .
