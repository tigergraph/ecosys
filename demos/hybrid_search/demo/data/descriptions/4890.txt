This song documents a particularly bleak period in Case 's life following the loss of her grandmother and both of her parents .
`` I was going through really a hard time and pretty depressed , '' she told UK newspaper The Guardian .
`` Just grieving .
Lost a lot of family and stuff .
It had n't happened all at once , but I had never really slowed down to grieve .
And I kind of took it in a farming way , you know , like ` They 're dead .
Got ta keep going . '
But you really do as a human being have to slow down and take it in and look it in the face .
And I had avoided it for so long that my body basically said , ` Guess what ?
I 'm just going to make you super-depressed now , because you have to deal with this stuff and transmute it or whatever you 're supposed to do with it .
Or you 're gon na be really fu -- ed up . ' ''
Case added that there was no sudden descent , more a steady slide to the bottom .
`` Just a gradual , ' I ca n't shake this , I ca n't shake this ... what is this ? ' ''
she explained .
`` Just super-unhappy and acting out here and there , just not being myself . ''
