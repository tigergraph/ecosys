This song was written and originally recorded by Willie Nelson on his 1990 album Born for Trouble .
This is a song about a guy who goes home with a 10 out of 10 girl .
When he wakes up , he finds she 's a 2 .
Chesney explained to Newsweek : `` That 's definitely autobiographical .
I admit it 's not the classiest song I 've ever recorded .
It 's an old Willie Nelson song .
This is probably going to be my beer-goggles song .
There are girls who are going to listen and say , you know what , I 've been there , too .
A girl leaving a bar , thinking she 's left with Brad Pitt and waking up with me or you . ''
He added : `` That was my reality in college a lot .
All the guys who have been on the road with me , when I played this song , their jaw dropped . ''
