This song was written by Jess Cates , Ty Lacy and Dennis Matkosky .
Martina McBride explained to CMT News what made her decide to record this song : `` I love the melody and I just love the sentiment .
I think that 's something that everybody wants to hear and everybody wants somebody in their life that they can say that to ... It 's a love song .
I have n't done a lot of really vulnerable love songs , but this one , even though it basically says , ` You 're the greatest thing ever , ' which has been said a million and two times , it said it in a way that I thought was a little bit different and fresh . ''
