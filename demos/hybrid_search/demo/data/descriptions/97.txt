This is a track from Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall 's third studio album , Tiger Suit .
She said of the song : `` It 's a signature track on the album for me , as it was one of my first attempts at mixing a picked acoustic tune with electronica .
Big , magic step for me . ''
Tunstall told MusicRemedy.com , `` It 's about confronting fear rather than running away . ''
Tiger Suit was recorded at Berlin 's Hansa studio , which is located beside the site of the Berlin Wall .
