This is a track from American Heavy Metal band Mastodon 's fifth studio album , The Hunter .
The song is about a video game that mixes asteroids with hemorrhoids .
Drummer/vocalist Brann Dailor told Kerrang !
: `` The lyrics to this are really aggressive but pretty childish .
They go , ' I want to drink some f -- ing blood / I want to break some f -- ing glass .
I want to turn you inside out , I want it all . '
We named it after this video game at the studio because it sounded silly . ''
