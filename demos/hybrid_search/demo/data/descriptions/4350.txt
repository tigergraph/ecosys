This testament to the power of memory is a track from the British alternative rock band Elbow 's fifth studio album , Build a Rocket Boys ! .
The song effectively uses handclaps , piano strings and the Halle Youth Choir to carry out its message .
Elbow 's connection to the Halle Youth Choir began with a concert during 2009 's Manchester International Festival , where the band , orchestra and youth choir played specially arranged versions of Elbow songs .
