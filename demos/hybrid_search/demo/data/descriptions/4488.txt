Ke $ ha told Spin magazine how the collaboration happened .
`` They just were down , and I was down , '' she explained .
`` A friend of mine plays with Julian and we kind of knew each other , and Julian really likes Dr. Luke so they were talking , and it kind of happened oddly organically and in a strange way .
I 'm a huge fan of their music , and they 're on one of my favorite songs on the record .
They 're part of a long list of some of my favorite bands that have actually collaborated with me on this record .
It 's really exciting for me to work with people that are unexpected .
I hope people freak out .
I kind of freaked out when he was like , ` Sure . '
I was like , ` Really ?! ' '' Regarding the song 's meaning , Ke $ ha said : `` This is a story about me falling in love , sitting outside and drinking wine , while thinking about a guy I love . ''
Ke $ ha took several years to pen this track , re-writing it on several occasions .
She said : `` That song drove me crazy , but I knew it was a good song that I just could n't crack the code of how to write it .
I was never happy with the song , so I re-wrote it for many times , and then one night I erased all the lyrics , started from a scratch and wrote the honest truth . ''
