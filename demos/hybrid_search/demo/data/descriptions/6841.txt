This song , which is just frontman and chief songwriter Johnny Borrell on piano , is about a house where he imagines his father dying .
Borrell explained to Ireland 's Sunday Tribune : `` I spent a long time writing that song and I wanted to make it perfect .
I was trying to write it in strict pentameter cross-rhyme and it very nearly is .
I was working it on the page for a long , long , long time ... So I played it to the guys and the one time I played it is the one time you hear it on the record . ''
