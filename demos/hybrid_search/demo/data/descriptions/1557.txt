In a track-by-track on her website , Jewel said this is one of her favorite songs on Sweet and Wild .
She described it as , `` a song I wrote a long time ago about leaving the ranch and feeling overwhelmed in the cities , traveling all the time and on the road .
I 'm so glad this has finally made the album .
It 's definitely in the ` wild ' category . ''
The song is about an elderly woman having a mental breakdown in a Wal-Mart bathroom .
In older recordings of this song , the incident took place in K-Mart rather than Wal-Mart .
