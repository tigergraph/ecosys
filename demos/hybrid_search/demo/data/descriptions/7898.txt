The closing track of Los Angeles rootsy quartet Dawes ' second album , Nothing Is Wrong , finds the band trading their guitar-driven sound for upright piano .
Frontman Taylor Goldsmith discussed the inspiration for the song with UK newspaper The Sun : `` I wrote down the title in my notebook , unsure if I was gon na use it for anything .
I was just excited about taking a phrase that I could use for a guy who was trying to explain how the world weighs on him and at the same time , for a guy explaining what he wants to eat .
Everything else came out of that . ''
