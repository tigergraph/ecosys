Kelly Clarkson penned this song for One Direction .
The What Does n't Kill You -LRB- Stronger -RRB- singer is proud of their recording : `` It 's a really cute song , I love it , '' she said .
`` I loved that they liked it .
They sound really great on it .
I already have it -- I 'm so VIP with my copy on my computer , It does sound really good . ''
Speaking to UK newspaper The Daily Star , Kelly Clarkson said she rarely gives her own tracks to other performers .
`` Giving away my songs is not something I do lightly , '' she explained .
`` I 'm very particular about that because my songs are like my babies .
If I wanted it done I can sing it myself .
I 'm such a writer 's snob .
People have asked for songs and I 'm like , ' I ca n't stand their voice , they 're not singing my song . '
`` However , on this occasion Simon Cowell asked Clarkson if One Direction could use one of her songs , and she realized the track would work after hearing the group perform .
`` When Simon Cowell put me forward to write for One Direction I said , ` Let me hear them first , ' '' she said .
`` Simon has been really supportive since I won American Idol .
` Tell Me a Lie ' is the cut I 've got on 1D 's album as I like the story of them , how they came together as a group .
While I wrote the song for me , it did n't fit in the current album as I never want an album to sound like one thought . ''
