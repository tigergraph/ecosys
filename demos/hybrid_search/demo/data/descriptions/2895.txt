Rebecca St. James is an Australian Grammy Award winning Christian pop rock singer-songwriter .
This song is the second single from her eighth studio album , If I Had One Chance To Tell You Something .
The song expresses St. James ' desire to tell her childhood friend about God 's amazing love .
She explained : `` It 's written about a childhood friend of mine that I grew up with in Sydney .
I fell out of contact with him after leaving our Christian school to move to a different state .
I ran into a mutual friend years later and asked how our friend , Daniel , was doing .
This friend told me that Daniel had really fallen away from God and that he 'd been abusing drugs as well .
As I was thinking about what I wanted to write about on this album , he very randomly came to mind -- and I felt that this ` random ' thought was actually placed there by God .
I had the concept ... ` If I had one chance to tell Daniel something , what would I say to him ? '
The message I felt God really laid on my heart was to tell him ... ` You are loved . '
This is a song for the prodigals -- which is all of us .
God is the father that has His arms open wide waiting for us .
He wants us to run towards Him and He will run toward us .
It 's a song of hope and a message my generation needs to hear .
` No matter where you 've been and what you 've done ... you are loved . '
From this song came the album title -- and really the key theme of the project . ''
