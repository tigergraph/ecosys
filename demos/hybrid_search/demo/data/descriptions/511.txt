Frontman James Skelly -LRB- from his record label 's website -RRB- : `` This was recorded in our practice room in Hoylake , it started off a bit like John Martyn , that 's where the inspiration came from , but I ca n't play guitar like him and it turned out nothing like him , but we just started playing on it and within an hour we had the whole tune arranged and we just recorded it the following week .
