The subject matter of this song is a night out with Hitler .
Bush explained in Q magazine , November 1989 : `` Years ago this friend of mine went to a dinner and spent the whole evening chatting to this fascinating guy , incredibly charming , witty , well-read , but never found out his name .
The next day he asked someone else who 'd been there who it was .
` Oh , did n't you know ?
That 's Oppenheimer , the man who invented the atomic bomb . '
My friend was horrified because he thought he should have given the guy hell , attacked him , he did n't know what.But the point was one moment this person is charming , then when you find out who he is , he 's completely different .
So I thought , Who 's the worst person you could possibly meet in those circumstances ?
Hitler !
And the story developed .
A woman at a dance before the war and this guy comes up to her tossing a coin with this cocky chat-up line .
Heads we 're dancing .
She does n't recognise him until she sees his face in the paper later on and then she 's devastated .
She thinks that if she 'd known she might have been able to get him and change the course of history .
But he was a person who fooled a tremendous number of people and I do n't think they can be blamed .
It worries me a bit that this song could be received wrongly , though . ''
