According to vocalist/guitarist James Petralli , White Denim 's songs are the musical manifestations of abstract paintings or philosophical tracts .
He explained to UK music magazine the NME : `` The things that I like to read are generally abstract .
I like patterns , I like reading poetry and avant-garde prose and I 'm more interested in musical patterns in literature than I am in long-form narratives .
I look at paintings and try to visualise an object or image , then assimilate how that makes me feel into a series of phrases and try to make it musical . ''
Petralli told the NME the song is about , `` creating work and weighing its importance . ''
This meditative hoedown is loosely based on some excerpts from The Blue and Brown Books by Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein .
Petralli told the NME : `` The lyric-writing process is like an excavation , I 'm trying to pull words and melodies out of what 's already there . ''
Petralli 's father is former Major League Baseball catcher Geno Petralli , whose career spanned 12 years , from 1982 to 1993 .
