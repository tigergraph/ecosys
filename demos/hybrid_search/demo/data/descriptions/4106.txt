Robert Plant provides guest vocals on this track .
The acts have recorded together in the past , with Plant playing harmonica on Primal Scream 's 2002 track `` The Lord Is My Shotgun , '' but this was the first time he sung with them .
The collaboration came about after Primal Scream members Andrew Innes and Bobby Gillespie bumped into Plant in the queue at Primrose Hill post office , which is near his home and Primal Scream 's London recording studio .
Innes told The Daily Record : `` Robert has a house near our studio .
It is bizarre .
We see him in the post office all the time .
`` We were in the post office when he asked us what we were up to and Bobby told him we were working on the new record .
`` He made the mistake of asking if we needed any help , so we got back to him and asked him to come and help us out .
`` We also meet him from time to time in the nearby Russian tea room and walking down the street .
It is weird to think , ` Here 's the hammer of the gods coming ' .
But you do n't want to be at the back of the post office queue with Robert Plant on pension day . ''
Robert Plant was a `` production choice . ''
Gillespie told NME : `` We brought Robert in not because of who he is , but for the sound of his voice .
He sings beautifully on it .
You might not even know it was Robert Plant if you had n't been told . ''
Plant told Mojo magazine : `` I sang a bit on the Primal 's stuff , because I think their references on looking back on the glorious past and the way they bring them into the contemporary world are fantastic . ''
