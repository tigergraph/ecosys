This is a track from is the self-titled debut album by American Country duo Court Yard Hounds , who were founded as a side project of the Dixie Chicks by sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire .
Robison is the lead vocalist and primary writer on most of the tracks , including this one , which was inspired by the view of San Antonio from her loft .
Maguire explained to The Boot why she let her sister do most of the writing on the album .
`` We started co-writing late in the game - I did n't even know she was writing !
She was basically doing it out of boredom .
The Chicks were taking a longer hiatus than we wanted to take , so we were spending our time in different ways .
At that point , Natalie was gardening and hanging out with her kids and going to Hawaii a lot , and she had her agenda .
And then I was doing a fiddle record in my studio , recording old fiddle tunes that I used to learn as a child .
And I was trying to have another baby .
And then Emily starts sending me these songs , and I 'm like , ` Oh I guess this is what you were doing ! '
Because she had over 30 songs .
Even though we talk all of the time , I was n't aware she was in her music room turning out all of these songs .
I think , in her mind , it was her way of expressing herself musically when we could n't .
When the Chicks were n't working , it was very frustrating for both of us because we needed a musical outlet .
I co-wrote one or two on the record and I wrote one on my own , but I came to the table late in the game and she had so many songs and I loved them so much , it was n't a concern of mine at all .
For the next album , we will do more co-writing . ''
