The National is a Brooklyn-based indie rock band who comprise lead singer Matt Berninger and two pairs of brothers : Aaron and Bryce Dessner and Scott and Bryan Devendorf .
This is the opening track from their fifth album , High Violet .
In an interview with Spinner UK , the comment was made that the lyrics of High Violet seem despairing and paranoid .
Berninger responded : `` There is a lot of mental chaos and the character is overwhelmed a lot .
` Terrible Love , ' it is n't necessarily so bad , it 's just about being overwhelmed by this emotion of love , whatever that is , or if you did something wrong to someone you love .
There 's a lot of stress and anxiety on there . ''
This song 's sound is typical of the much denser and heavier instrumentation on High Violet compared to what the National has done previously .
Aaron Dessner explained to The Quietus : '' ` Loose wool ' is ` Terrible Love . '
I remember Bryce saying , ` Ok , what does loose wool sound like ? '
and Matt went , ` bam-bam-bam ' -LSB- makes much more sense audibly -RSB- so then I created this effect and turned the amp up beyond loud , tuned the guitar down and just had these harmonic pedals on that make it sound weird .
I was strumming simple chords -- the chord progression is like a Bon Jovi progression , like G , C -- but because of the weird effect it does n't sound like it .
So we ran with that idea and a lot of the songs have a similar texture . ''
