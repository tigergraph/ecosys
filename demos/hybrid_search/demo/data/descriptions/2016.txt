The song 's lyrics speak of being in love with alcohol , but also represent any kind of debilitating love that blinds .
Guitarist C.J. Pierce told Artist Direct that vocalist Ryan McCombs `` did start writing about a relationship and then we put a twist on the lyrics where it was about alcohol , but really it could be about whatever you want it to be .
It 's open enough to where it could be about a relationship -- blinded by love or blinded by alcohol or anything . ''
Pierce told Artist Direct that it took McCombs some time to get used to the song 's soft acoustic musical backing .
He explained : `` The words are very personal .
This song has such a cool vibe to it .
We never had anything that deep so I think it took Ryan a bit to get used to it .
Musically , it 's really awesome because that song really takes me to a personal place .
Back in 2002 when we were touring , before Dave -LSB- William , original Drowning Pool vocalist -RSB- passed away , we had a day off in Atlanta .
Dave had found Zakk Wylde 's Book of Shadows CD , and there 's a lot of great music on that record .
So , musically , I was influenced by Book of Shadows and that vibe with the acoustic guitar .
It takes me there , but lyrically this song is about alcohol .
It 's about being in love with alcohol .
Some people have issues with it - whatever .
We played that song at a place called Duke 's in Dallas when we were still working on it , and the vibe in the room was so awesome .
When we went in the studio , I think it turned out to be better than the demos .
It 's something so left field for Ryan that it took him a minute to get used to it .
It 's out of his comfort zone , but he sounds great .
I love that song . ''
