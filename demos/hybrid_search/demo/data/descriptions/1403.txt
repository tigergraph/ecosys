This Jackson self-penned ballad pays tribute to the comforts of long-term love and marriage .
Jackson has been married to his high school sweetheart Denise since December 15 , 1979 and this is one of several upbeat tracks on Freight Train about matters of the heart .
He told The Boot : `` A lot of my songs are positive songs about being in a relationship a long time , like ` The Best Keeps Getting Better ' .
I write what I know about , I guess , and that 's where I 'm at .
But , man , I love sad songs .
I like to write sad songs .
They 're much easier to write and you get a lot more emotion into them .
But people do n't want to hear them as much .
And radio definitely does n't ; they want that positive , uptempo thing . ''
Jackson explained in press materials why so many of his songs skew more toward contentment than sadness .
`` I 'm a real visual person , and when I 'm writing , especially if it 's a story-type song , I visualize what I know , '' he explained .
`` It 's much easier if you write about something real .
If I pick something that did n't sound like what I 'd written or was part of what people think my life is , it probably would n't ring true , you know ? ''
He added `` In ` The Best Keeps Getting Better , ' I did use a lot of images from me and Denise , and everybody can see it 's her in there .
But I do n't think it 's so direct it could n't be about anybody that 's been married for quite a while . ''
