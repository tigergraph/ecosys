`` It 's a beautiful thing that we do , you just pour your heart out onto a page , '' says Brad Arnold , explaining his inspiration for this song .
`` And I do n't mind anybody looking at my heart . ''
He especially loves when his fans interpret his lyrics in their own way , to suit their own personal situations .
`` Pouring your heart onto a page leaves you there , vulnerable , waiting for somebody to maybe even care to read what you wrote .
And then if they read it , do they really see it ?
And if they see it , do they relate ?
And is it comfortable for them ?
Or is it a crutch for them ?
And it almost seems like sometimes you hold up a lot of weight with what you say .
I mean , you 're obligated to .
`` At the same time , the lead singer says with a laugh , `` That song is just kind of griping about being a songwriter in a way .
And a lot of people kind of like that introspective view . ''
Not someone who thrives on fame , Brad enjoys relative anonymity .
But he has found himself at times fending off fans who ca n't believe they 're seeing the lead singer of 3 Doors Down in person .
He says many people are surprised when they discover that Brad himself has written hits that folks sometimes have n't even recognized as being a 3 Doors Down song .
`` I get that more than you know , '' he says .
`` And I like it .
Because I care absolutely nothing about fame .
I like the fact that we can go out and be successful , and we can still go to , like Wal-Mart .
Like , in my hometown , I think , Okay , that 's one Wal-Mart I ca n't go to .
Pull the hat down and like , ` Eee !
I do n't see you !
I do n't see you ! ' ''
he laughs .
`` But I like the fact that people sometimes do n't know , and if they say , ` What band do you play for ? '
And I tell 'em .
And they 're like , ` Oh , what songs y' all singing ? '
And they might or might not know ` Kryptonite ' and some of that stuff .
But you throw out ` Here Without You ' and things like that , they 're like , ` You sing that ? '
I 'm like , ` Yup . '
They 're like , ` Wow . ' ''
