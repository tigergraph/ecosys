This is a track from A Year Without Rain , the second album from American Pop group Selena Gomez & The Scene .
Selena 's fans inspired many of the songs on the record .
`` I wanted to make sure it made people feel good , but I also dedicated a couple songs to my fans , because there were moments onstage that I wish I could give to them , because they mean so much to me , '' the singer explained to MTV News .
`` So there are songs like ` Intuition ' and ` Spotlight ' that are specifically for my fans and a way of saying , ' I get to live such a great life , but you guys deserve the spotlight as much as I do . ' ''
