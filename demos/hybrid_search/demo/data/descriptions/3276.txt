Speaking to UK newspaper The Sun , Lana explained the background to this track : `` It 's a song about a man who thought I was one of the most exotic things he had ever seen and me indulging in his appreciation and love .
On the outside he was handsome and wholesome , but under wraps he was running an illegal electronic business which ended up taking him and his friends under , hence the chorus -- ` You look like a million dollar man , so why is my heart broke ? ' ''
Lana is quoting the opening lines of Elvis Presley/Carl Perkins '50s hit `` Blue Suede Shoes '' when she sings , `` One for the money/Two for the show . ''
Del Rey told The Sun this torch song is her favorite song to sing live .
`` It sounds best in New York City jazz clubs under a blue spot light , '' she said .
