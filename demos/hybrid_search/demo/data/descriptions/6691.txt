The song was written about John 's best friend , River Pheonix , who was an actor who died of a drug overdose on October 31 , 1993 .
John claimed that he was in communication with `` spirits '' towards the end of the song .
He said in a 1997 interview with Guitar Player magazine : '' I was having verbal communication with the spirits while I was recording ; and I started crying at the end of it .
The spirits give you ideas for things , and what 's important to them is what 's important to me .
I 'm much more concerned with my fame in their world than with my fame in this one .
That 's why it 's been difficult for me to adjust to being alive at all . ''
The first half of the song was written before River Pheonix 's death , while the second half was written afterwards .
Frusciante intended this song for his 1994 album Niandra Lades And Usually Just a T-Shirt , but he decided to leave it off .
