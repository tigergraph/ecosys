The first single from Carrie Underwood 's fourth studio album was co-penned by the American Idol winner with songwriters Chris DeStefano -LRB- Scotty McCreery 's `` Better Than This , '' Kelly Clarkson 's `` Let Me Down '' -RRB- and Ashley Gorley -LRB- Trace Adkins 's `` You 're Gon na Miss This '' and Carrie 's own hit `` All American Girl . '' -RRB-
The song was released to country radio on February 23 , 2012 .
Underwood said of the inspiration for the song in a behind-the-scenes film for its video : `` We 've all been this girl before , who just believes the best in the man that she 's with , no matter what .
But people are like , ` What 's wrong with you ? '
So we tried to take the story of dual personalities : one is good and one is knowledgeable ... She 's not bad , she 's just trying to give the good girl some knowledge and say , ` Wake up !
Open up your eyes and see this guy for what he is . ' ''
Underwood said why she channels her inner rocker in this song : `` My inner rock chick has always been there , '' she explained .
`` I grew up listening to a lot of rock music through my sisters , who were teenagers while I was young , so they had control of the radio .
Just working with different people and experiencing different things influences what happens naturally .
It 's not like a guided effort to switch directions or add different stuff in your music -- it just happens .
You do n't fight it , you just go with it . ''
The visual won the Video Of The Year prize at the 2012 CMT Awards .
Carrie explained that she and her co-writers set out to pen something that will have her fans dancing along .
`` We went into the writing session thinking we need to write something that just kicks butt , '' she said , `` and Chris DeStefano , I call him a little mad scientist on all of his Pro Tools stuff -- he , like , plays every instrument you could possibly think of , and he , like , started makin ' this track , and we started ... we just went .
It was fast .
We wrote it fast , and it 's just fun !
It 's upbeat , it 's fun , you stomp your feet , and you can dance to it .
It 's got this really rockin ' verse , and this really , like , rockin ' country chorus .
So , it 's just a really cool song . ''
Speaking to a group of Nashville journalists , Underwood discussed how she relates to the jilted character in this song : `` I 've been that stupid girl that was with this guy , '' she said .
`` Not anytime recently , but I have had people come up to me and say , ` You do n't need to be with him .
I 'm telling you as a friend . '
But they would never be blunt with me , it was always dancing around it and I would think , ` This is n't the person I know . '
So I 've been that ` Good Girl ' that needed someone to smack her .
We all have ! ''
This was the last song that Underwood co-wrote for her fourth album .
She was in Los Angeles and called Ashley Gorley to see if he had time to write with her .
`` I wanted to write a fun song for the album .
We wrote it so fast and it was so much fun to write , '' Underwood recalled to Reuters .
