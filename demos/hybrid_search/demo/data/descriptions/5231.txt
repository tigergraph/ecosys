We do n't have many wolf-related facts on this site , but here 's one : According to a January 20 , 2011 news report on Norwegian TV channel TV 2 , thirteen-year-old Walter Eikrem , who lives in the southern Norwegian town of Rakkestad , was walking home from school when four wolves appeared on the path ahead of him.Eikrem was listening to `` Overcome '' through his mobile phone and decided he 'd try and utilize Creed 's music to scare the wolves away .
He reportedly removed his headphones and turned the volume up to maximum , and yelled as loud as he could while flailing his arms about wildly to scare off the pack .
Eikrem said that when the wolves heard the music blasted at them they `` did n't really get scared , they just turned around and simply trotted away . ''
