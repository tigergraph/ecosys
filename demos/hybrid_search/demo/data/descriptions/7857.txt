Christina Milian told MTV News that this is a `` love anthem . ''
She added : `` It 's the first time -LSB- I 'm -RSB- putting out a ballad .
I think it 's a representation of what we need in this world right now .
There are people that are holding it down for somebody .
It 's important to have someone that has your back . ''
This song was Milian 's first single on Interscope , after leaving Def Jam Records in 2006 .
The song 's music video was directed by Ray Kay , who previously helmed the singer 's clips for `` Say I '' and `` Whatever U Want . ''
Milian described its set-up to MTV News as `` very Mad Max versus 300 . ''
She explained : `` I 'm in sand dunes .
And , I 'm out there ... me and my guy , -LSB- and -RSB- we probably are the last two people on Earth .
Really , I 'm on my own and I 'm searching , and finally he comes to me .
I do n't know where he 's been , and he comes back to me .
It 's very timeless .
When you see it , it 's nothing like anything you 'd see now .
I want to be iconic in every music video that I do .
I want to make a mark .
This is very different . ''
