Jewel blogged concerning this song on her MySpace site : '' -LRB- This -RRB- is an outside song that I cut because I loved the vocal range it allowed me to perform .
I kept meaning to write a big ballad , but one never came , and my friend Rachael Proctor co-wrote this one .
It 's a great song .
I love songwriters , and it 's fun to just be a singer for a song and support another songwriter ! ''
Rachel Proctor , along with Victoria Banks , also co-wrote pop singer Jessica Simpson 's debut country single `` Come on Over . ''
She has recorded several hits of her own including the Top 20 single `` Me and Emily . ''
Jewel expanded on her website regarding why she decided to cut this song : `` It was written by a friend of mine and I chose it because it was vocally challenging .
I meant to get around to writing one that pushed me as a singer , as I have always sung better live , and have tended to write wordier songs , rather than ones the showed my singing off .
It was a goal of mine to really sing better on this record than on any I had done .
This song is well written , and is a great showcase for some singing , and I want to thank the writers . ''
