New York based dance-punk outfit The Rapture 's frontman Luke Jenner found himself on an emotional roller coaster in the five year gap between the band 's third album Pieces Of The People We Love and their fourth In The Grace of Your Love .
He experienced both personal tragedy with his mother 's suicide , and great happiness with the birth of his son .
Such events , added to the long absences when the band were away touring , put pressure on his marriage .
This song was inspired by the difficulties Jenner and his wife encountered .
He explained to Spin magazine : '' ` Roller Coaster ' is about keeping my marriage together .
It 's our 10th wedding anniversary on August 25 -LRB- 2011 -RRB- , and we 've been through a lot .
My wife 's an incredible , very patient person .
I 'm on a rollercoaster being in a band - it 's record and then , ` Bye !
See you in three months ! '
We 're getting a lot better at navigating those obstacles .
` Rollercoaster ' is almost like the Beatles song ` Oh Darlin '' .
It 's saying , ` Please stay with me .
I would n't be happy if you were n't here . '
It 's a declaration of love , but it 's also acknowledging that I do n't have control over other people loving me or not . ''
