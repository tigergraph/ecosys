Buckcherry frontman and lyricist Josh Todd explained that despite the title , this song does not have religious connotations .
Said Todd : `` I was born and raised in sunny California , and when the sun comes out and beautiful women start wearing less clothes .
And with all the hottest girls migrating here , you look around some days and you find yourself saying , ` Oh my lord . '
So no , this is not my gospel song . ''
Guitarist Keith Nelson recalled regarding this song : `` Josh did a masterful job of saying those nasty things that he often says in a very clever and veiled way that 's made it so you could certainly play that song on the radio .
He called me one day , and said that he wanted to write a song that had some of the same feel and the same sense of space as great old songs like ` All Right Now ' or ` Highway to Hell . '
It 's hard to leave the space anymore , and that 's part of the problem with lots of modern music .
The guys in this band can play their asses off , but part of the secret is not always playing .
I think it 's my favorite song on the album . ''
