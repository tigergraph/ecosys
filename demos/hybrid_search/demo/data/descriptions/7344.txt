After releasing their debut album , Coming to Terms , on Atlantic Records , L.A.-based rock quartet Carolina Liar 's sophomore set Wild Blessed Freedom was self-released through RED .
This anthemic tune is the first single from the record .
Singer/guitarist Chad Wolf told Billboard magazine : `` It 's a song about coming to terms with the decision to start a new life .
In a lot of ways , it 's about where the band is now .
We 've parted ways with Atlantic and are now on our own and like any new adventure , it 's something that 's both daunting and exciting .
We 're looking forward to the journey . ''
The Kevin Adamson-directed music video finds the band drowned in paint as they perform the song .
Wolf told AOL Music the clip was an enjoyable shoot .
Said the frontman : `` Believe it or not that was so much fun for everyone .
It really did n't take too long - it was two hours at the most - and it was all shot at three times the speed of the song so we could create some slow motion .
From the confetti and the paint , I would say it took a week to get all of that out ! ''
Wolf told Alternative Addiction how this Max Martin produced tune came about : `` The crazy thing with that song is it kind of came along and developed over time .
Max discovered it and kept us working on the track , '' he explained .
`` It developed out of this idea that sometimes you just have to throw yourself into something completely and kind of drown in it to create something new .
Basically what that song became was the theme of the whole record .
That idea began to permeate every single thing that we did .
It became the red thread for every track on the album . ''
