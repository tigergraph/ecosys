An earlier version of Angles was produced by Joe Chiccarelli , whose impressive CV includes work with U2 and The White Stripes .
However , the original material was largely scrapped by The Strokes and this is the only track held over from the original sessions .
The other nine tracks ended up being produced by the band themselves .
The Strokes debuted this song when they were the musical guest on the March 5 , 2011 episode of Saturday Night Live .
Lead singer Julian Casablancas told the NME : `` That 's probably my favourite on the album .
The verse was a random old Brazilian thing I had , but it works well with the chorus .
I like the chorus : it gives me cheesy/happy vibes . ''
