This is the second single and title track from Canadian singer/songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen 's debut EP .
Like much of the record , it was penned with her long-time collaborator , writer/producer Ryan Stewart , who is also the frontman of the Canadian pop-punk band Marianas Trench .
It was released on February 24 , 2012 .
The song finds Carly singing about a bad boy who treats her badly , but she ca n't get out of her mind .
It came out differently to anything she 'd done previously - more poppy than her other folk-styled tunes .
`` I was singing it in the mic , to demo it out , with these guts that I did n't know I had , '' Carly recalled .
`` And it was exciting .
It was like a braver version of me that I never had experimented with before , at least not out loud to people .
`` Carly did n't know what to do about the new song , wondering how it would fit on the record .
For eight months , she and Stewart wrestled with it , before concluding that pop had just as much a place on the EP as folk .
