This song was not supposed to make sense , and the chorus was written to certify this song as nonsense : `` If you have to ask , you 'll never know . ''
The clapping at the end of the song is for John Frusciante 's improvised guitar solo .
-LRB- thanks , evan - Paramus , New Jersey -RRB- Although a single was made for this song , it was banned from radio stations because the line after `` If you have to ask , you 'll never know '' was `` Funky motherf -- kers will not be told to go . ''
The funky motherf -- kers were the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
-LRB- thanks , Spencer - Equinunk , PA , for above 2 -RRB-
