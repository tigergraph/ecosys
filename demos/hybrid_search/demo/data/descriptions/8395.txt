Lead singer Thom Yorke : `` The first essay I ever wrote in school was , ` you are an alien from another planet .
You have landed , and you are standing in the middle of Oxford , and write an essay about what you see if you 're an alien form another planet , how would you see these people ? '
and that 's where a lot of it came from , really . ''
On this song , the band was trying to mimic the sound of Miles Davis ' album Bitches Brew using synthesizers and guitars .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France , for all above -RRB- An influence on this song was an experience Yorke had when he was driving down a country road and hit a pheasant .
After stepping out of the car to investigate he began thinking about alien abduction .
The title is a play on the Bob Dylan song `` Subterranean Homesick Blues . ''
In Humo magazine July 22 , 1997 , Yorke said : `` A tribute to Dylan 's ` Subterranean Homesick Blues . '
-LRB- sings -RRB- ` Jonny 's in the basement mixing up the medicine , I 'm on the pavement thinking about the government . '
Do I really hope to be on a spaceship ?
Why not .
I believe there are aliens under the ground .
I want to see them .
I want to see ghosts .
I want to walk on the street smiling , knowing that there are little green creatures with incredible large brains and big , beautiful , black eyes , that are filming us with their video cameras . ''
This was originally titled `` Uptight . ''
