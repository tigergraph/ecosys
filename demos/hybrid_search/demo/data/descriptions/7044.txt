This song finds lead singer Jon Davis questioning whether he really wants all this fame .
This was a common theme for his songwriting at the time , as Korn had released two successful albums and was under increasing pressure from their record company .
The band delivered a # 1 album with Follow The Leader thanks in large part to this song , which was one of just two singles released from it -LRB- the other was `` Freak on a Leash '' -RRB- .
The entire band contributes to Korn 's songwriting , and they share the composer credits equally .
In our interview with their guitarist Brian `` Head '' Welch , he explained that this track materialized quickly , but its Disco leanings were a serious concern .
`` I was stoked , because I lived in Redondo Beach at the time .
The studio where we wrote was about 15 minutes from my house , '' he said .
`` We were going in there for like eight hours a day .
We would n't take that many breaks , we were just going at it .
And I remember when ` Got the Life ' happened , he -LSB- drummer David Silveria -RSB- did that disco beat .
All of us looked at each other .
It 's a haunting guitar line and melody , but the drums were a little happier than metal .
And so we were like , ` Is this good or is this kind of cheesy ? '
Because it 's kind of like a Disco beat .
So we were kind of scared of it .
We were like , ' I do n't know if our fans would like this . '
It was so unique , and the more we sat with it and added to the song , we were like , ` Wow , this is crazy different .
Let 's go with this . '
It ended up being one of the biggest hits .
You 've got to be open to try new things in music is what that proved . ''
