Bad Meets Evil is an American Hip Hop duo comprising Eminem and Royce da 5 ' 9 .
The pair first teamed up in the late '90s when they were underground Detroit MC 's .
After releasing a few recordings , the rappers pursued solo careers after their initial work together and became embroiled in a feud .
After reconciling they revived their project a decade later and released their Hell : The Sequel EP on Shady/Interscope Records on June 14 , 2011 .
Royce 's verse finds him recalling his dad hanging up his postal carrier uniform .
`` I cried plenty tears , my daddy got ta bad back , '' he rap-sings .
`` So it 's only right , that I write till he can march right/In to that post office and tell 'em to hang it up . ''
`` It was always a goal of mine to hopefully retire my father someday , '' Royce explained to The Boombox .
He added : `` I 'm so tired of hearing him complain about his back .
I was always a daddy 's boy ; always looked up to my daddy .
So that 's just a goal of mine for my parents to chill , while they are still young .
If they could spend their 60s and 70s just chillin ' , that 'd be good for me . ''
This soft-hop track features Bruno Mars and was produced by his production team The Smeezingtons along with Eminem and Battle Roy .
Mars ' refrain gives the tune similar dynamics to his collaboration with B.O.B. , `` Nothin ' on You . ''
Hell : The Sequel topped the Billboard 200 in its debut week , having sold 171,000 copies .
Though Eminem has reached the summit many times previously , Royce 's previous best chart position had been the # 110 ranking of 2009 's Street Hop .
