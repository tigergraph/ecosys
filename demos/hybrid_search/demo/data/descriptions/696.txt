The first promotional single from American band Selena Gomez & The Scene 's album When The Sun Goes Down got the singer 's fans busy blogging .
It finds the Monte Carlo star dismissing a former boyfriend in favor of a far better beau with more swagger .
Is Selena singing about her relationship with Justin Bieber ?
And who is the ex she claims was an inferior model - Nick Jonas ?
Taylor Lautner ?
In an interview with Billboard magazine , Selena gave little away to whom the lyrics are addressed , though she admitted it was her who came up with second verse .
Said Selena : '' ` Bang , Bang , Bang ' was one of the first ones that I picked out to put on the record .
It 's a really fun , it 's a cheeky song .
It 's kind of an insult/compliment song about someone that used to be in your life and now someone who is in your life who 's amazing .
It 's a sweet song and I feel like a lot of girls can related to it especially .
Priscilla Renea and Toby Gad are the ones behind that genius song .
I got to incorporate my personal lyrics in the second verse which was pretty nice . ''
Selena penned the song with American songwriter Priscilla Renea , who previously wrote Gomez ' song `` Who Says . ''
Renea also co-wrote Cheryl Cole 's 2010 UK # 1 hit `` Promise This , '' which referenced the nursery rhyme `` Alouette . ''
There was another UK top ten single in 2010 that borrowed from the same children 's song , which was written and recorded by Mark Ronson .
Its title was ... `` Bang Bang Bang . ''
