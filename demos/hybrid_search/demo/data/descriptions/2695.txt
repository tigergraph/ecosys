Lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong wrote this when his girlfriend moved to Ecuador .
He tried to be levelheaded about it , but to show his anger , he named the song `` Good Riddance '' and made `` Time Of Your Life '' the subtitle .
The song shows us about life , how we are not to question it and keep moving on .

Armstrong recalled to Spin Magazine in a 2010 interview : `` That was really the first time we attempted a ballad .
The first time we ever played that song was during an encore in New Jersey - I had to pound a beer backstage to get up the courage .
I knew we were gon na take a tomato to the face . ''
This was used on the TV show ER in an episode where a young boy dies of cancer .
-LRB- thanks , Natalie - Little Rock , AR -RRB- The album version begins with guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong playing a wrong note .
