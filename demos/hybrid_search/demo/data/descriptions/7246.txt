This dreamy ballad was released as the first single from the `` Paradise '' edition of Born To Die .
It is one of nine additional nine tracks on the set .
Del Rey recorded the song at the Shangri-La Studios in Malibu , California .
The Shangri-La has been the home to the likes of Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton , as well as The Band who made recordings there for their documentary/movie , The Last Waltz .
The song was produced by legendary knobmeister Rick Rubin and written by Del Rey and Justin Parker , who also co-penned the singer 's breakout hit `` Video Games . ''
The song 's ten minute music video was directed by Anthony Mandler -LRB- Rihanna , Fun , Drake -RRB- and finds Del Rey taking shelter in a series of different men .
Del Rey told Radio.com that she considers Mandler , who also helmed the singer 's clip for `` National Anthem '' and her short film Tropico to be her `` directorial soulmate , '' She explained : `` I always give him these mood boards and storyboards that he goes through and makes all of the visions I have come to life .
He never says no and he asks me why do I want it to be about the kindness of strangers , like in the case of ` Ride ' -- why am I with different men and things like that ?
I tell him it 's not about being submissive to men or anything like that .
It 's about not really knowing anyone close to you who can help you , and being really lucky enough to finding people who you just meet randomly , who can take care of you until you can take care of yourself . ''
