Clarkson explained on her record label 's website that this is actually about two different people in the verse and the chorus .
She said : `` That 's the first time I ever did that .
The lyrics are about something very true to me .
You know how you want someone , but ca n't have them because they 're off-limits ?
In the chorus , I sing that , even if you had 'em , you know you 'd screw it up .
You always want what you ca n't have .
It 's a funny , ironic song . ''
