Madness formed as a ska-pop band in 1978 and were one of the most successful acts during the two-tone movement in the UK in the early 1980s .
The Liberty of Norton Folgate was their first album release for ten years .
The song name checks Jewish boxers Battling Levinsky and Jackie Berg .
Suggs told The Sun May 22 , 2009 : `` I thought The Liberty of Norton Folgate was such a great name for a record .
Every British person 's dream is to live slightly outside the law , under the radar , running their own village society .
It 's a very romantic notion . ''
This 10-minute title track recounts the social history of a corner of east London that until 1900 was controlled by St. Paul 's Cathedral and as such was legally independent from its surroundings .
Frontman Suggs told Uncut magazine February 2008 that the song tries to do what Peter Ackroyd did in his book , London : The Biography .
He explained : `` It 's about the city as entity , called ` The Liberty Of Norton Folgate . '
The places outside the city gates were called ` liberties , ' because that 's where the police took liberties with young boys and prostitutes and where new immigrants arrived .
They established their own communities outside the gates because they could n't get in .
The song is a history of Shoreditch -LRB- a place in East London -RRB- - from the Huguenots through to the Bangladeshis .
It 's about how the joy of living in London is that it 's always changing .
In the current climate , it seemed worth saying .
The last line is ` And in the beginning was the fear of the immigrant . '
We 've moved on from there so , let 's get on with it . ''
Suggs told Mojo magazine February 2008 that the album has : `` a semi-autobiographical , everyday-life-in-London theme .
All seven of us have written for it . ''
