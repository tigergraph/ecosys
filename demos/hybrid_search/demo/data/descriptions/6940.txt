This funky , festive tune is set in a strip club , and finds vocalist Anthony Kiedis pausing to , `` take a look at my last decision . ''
Apparently bassist Flea spent a good deal of time during the writing and recording of the song listening to late '70s Rolling Stones numbers , and it shows .
The song was released as the third single from I 'm With You on January 25 , 2012 .
The Robert Hales directed video pans four different rooms , each containing a member of the band .
`` I can say that the band were great to work with - real gentlemen - and it was a genuinely collaborative process , '' said Hales to Spinner .
`` They were all extremely involved creatively .
Each room loosely represented the band members ' personalities , so almost all the props and artwork in the rooms came from their personal collections .
`` In Kiedis ' room we see him noodling with model Charlotte Free , his dog and son Everly , whilst a blue-haired , shaving cream-covered Flea is dancing around in his room with his girlfriend , Sandha Khin .
Chad Smith is in a bathroom working a punching bag , whilst Josh Klinghoffer hangs out in his room , which is empty bar a table and a lamp .
All four rooms were filmed simultaneously and video was done in just four whole takes which , according to Hales , is `` very impressive . ''
`` They had a very clear idea of how they wanted to perform and they nailed it , '' he said .
`` All in all it was a fantastic experience and I 'm very proud of what we created . ''
