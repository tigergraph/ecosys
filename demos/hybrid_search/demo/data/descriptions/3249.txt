This Britpop ballad finds Alex Turner in a reflective , almost melancholic mood as he recounts a tale of drunken advances at a party : `` As all the signals are sent , her eyes invite you to approach And it seems as though those lumps in your throat .
That you just swallowed have got you going . ''
The girl is a `` certified mind blower '' and aware of the effect that she 's having on Alex. He 's waiting for the perfect song , a `` No. 1 Party Anthem , '' to give him the courage to hit it off with her .
Several well-known songs are quoted in the lyrics , including Dusty Springfield 's `` The Look Of Love , '' Coldplay 's `` A Rush Of Blood To The Head '' and `` the number one party anthem , '' Madness ' `` House Of Fun . ''
The song starts : `` So you 're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not Leather jacket , collar popped like Cantona . ''
Eric Cantona is a retired French footballer turned actor , who famously played for Manchester United with his collar popped up .
