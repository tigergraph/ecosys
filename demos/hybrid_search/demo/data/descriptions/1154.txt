This is about Ozzy 's fans .
They are what `` gets him through . ''
The video contained images of fire and blood .
When the US was attacked by terrorists , MTV sent it back and refused to air it until it was edited to be more sensitive .
Ozzy cut a new version which the network aired .
The video was directed by Jonas Ackerland , who has also worked with U2 and Madonna .
The song was an attempt to clean up Ozzy 's image .
He claims that he is `` not the antichrist , '' something he has been accused of by many people over the years .
The tour to support this opened on Halloween , 2001 .
It was going to be the `` Black Christmas '' tour , but after the terrorist attacks , it was changed to the `` Merry Mayhem '' tour .
Ozzy was in New York and saw the World Trade Center collapse .
This was the first single from the album .
Zakk Wylde , who has played on many of Ozzy 's projects , played guitar on the album .
