This is the first single from 3 Doors Down 's fifth studio album , Time of My Life .
The single was released to iTunes on February 1 , 2011 .
Arnold explained to Artist Direct what the song means to him : `` So many times , older people look at young kids and say , ` Enjoy this time !
It 's the best time of your life , ' when it 's really not .
Being young is hard .
Everything 's in front of you for the first time .
Those things that are in front of you seem so much bigger than they do when you 're looking back on them .
I 'm 32 now and looking back on my teenage years and before , a lot of it does n't seem as hard as it did then because now it 's behind me and I hardly remember it .
You get the responsibilities of the world as an adult .
However , when you were in high school , there was nothing bigger than that test on Friday .
Now , you do n't even remember what test it was -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
It 's hard to be young .
The song discusses that . ''
Lead singer Brad Arnold wrote the song with Aerosmith and Def Leppard producer Marti Frederiksen .
Arnold described the track to Billboard magazine as , `` almost a mockery of how easy people think it is to be young .
Young people always hear , ` This is the greatest time of your life ... , ' but it 's not always that way , y' know ? ''
The song 's music video was uploaded to YouTube on March 23 , 2011 .
Arnold told Noisecreep about the clip : `` This video symbolizes the struggles that we face as we fight to make our way through the seemingly narrow passages of our lives .
It reflects our fight and our vulnerability .
Ryan Smith and his team have done a wonderful job bringing the song to life through this edgy , cinematic delivery .
I hope that everyone can see themselves in some way within the characters of this video . ''
