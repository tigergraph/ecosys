This was the first P.O.D. album to feature guitarist Marcos Curiel since their 2001 Satellite album .
He left the band in controversial circumstances in early 2003 and rejoined them in December 2006 .
Lead singer Sonny Sandoval explained to Christian Music Today about the album title : `` Marcos brought the idea to the table and it initially started with the idea of not always seeing eye to eye .
Obviously everybody knows we 're getting back together and everyone knows -LSB- we 've had -RSB- our differences , so that sparked it .
Then I ran with the idea that it 's also the every day dance you have with life .
When you dance , only one half can lead and the other half can follow .
What 's in your life that pushes you in the direction that you 're going in ?
That 's of course open to interpretation , but it could be thought of as the inner struggle of good and evil , or this way and that way . ''
