Written and performed by American satirist Tom Lehrer , this song has been called macabre .
Lehrer himself said of it , `` You know , of all the songs I have ever sung , that is the one I 've had the most requests not to '' .
It might be described as a borderline ode to necrophilia/murder ballad with a touch of madness - but not the Aldo Nova kind .
