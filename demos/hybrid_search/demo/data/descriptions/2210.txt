The name of the band , as well as song titles such as this one , plays off of Nick Jonas ' much-publicized fascination with the presidency .
Nick told Billboard magazine : `` I 've always been fascinated with it , and partially because I hope to be the president one day - I hope to run .
Another -LRB- reason is -RRB- I think that it really reflects a lot of things about who we are in this country and the culture .
It 's amazing how you can tie stuff in with it - conspiracy theories , state of emergency , olive and an arrow , rose garden - all of these things you think just relate to one thing can really expand .
You can find a whole song about it . ''
Nick explained to Shine On Media : `` It 's a song about my fascination with conspiracy theories and mostly aliens . ''
