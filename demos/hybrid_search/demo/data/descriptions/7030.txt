Josh Homme 's Them Crooked Vultures bandmate Dave Grohl plays drums on this song as well as on `` My God Is The Sun , '' `` If I Had A Tail , '' `` Fairweather Friends '' and `` I Appear Missing . ''
Homme told NME : `` Our relationship is based as much on telling each other to shut up as making each other laugh , which means its honest .
So he 'll play something ridiculous , then do it for 45 seconds , then a minute and just see how long he can get away with doing that s -- t. '' The song was used to soundtrack a commercial for the soda drink Mountain Dew .
The 30-second `` This Is How We Dew '' ad also featured pro snowboarder Danny Davis .
Homme told The Quietus that this was an `` early demo that looked so promising but just never came together until the very end . ''
He added that the band got sick of saying `` aah this is a bummer . ''
Eventually it became the defining moment of the record where he sings about hitting back - `` a direct face punch in the mirror . ''
