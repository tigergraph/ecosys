Corbin penned this song with Carson Chamberlain and Mark D. Sanders .
He explained in press materials : `` We took a trip out to Colorado and this is the first song we wrote out there .
I came up with the melody here at home and Carson had the idea ' I never knew the blues could get this far from Memphis . '
I 've always liked traveling songs . ''
