Lonerism has a theme running through it of discovering you 're a loner .
Frontman Kevin Parker told NME about the album 's closing track : `` The straw that breaks the camel 's back .
It 's about this final release of just becoming an absolute drifter .
An absolute loner , I guess .
Because all this s -- t has happened , all these crazy tumbling synths and emotions have happened before .
And this song at the end is really sombre .
All the other songs were immensely layered , and this one is really just a piano and a voice , singing about how I ca n't be f -- ed any more , how I 'm gon na detach myself completely . ''
