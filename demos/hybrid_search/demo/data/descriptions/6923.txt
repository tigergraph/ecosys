This was the opening track from Roxy Music 's second album , For Your Pleasure .
Frontman Bryan Ferry told The Mail on Sunday June 28 , 2009 : `` I had long been a fan of Cole Porter and other songwriters from his era . ''
He added that this song , `` was an attempt to emulate that style of writing , with a lot of cultural references that I found interesting . ''
German synthpop band Alphaville covered this on their 2003 album , CrazyShow .
Brian Eno , who went on to become a very successful and influential producer , played synthesizer in Roxy Music , leaving after the For Your Pleasure album .
One of the many groups he inspired was OMD , whose lead singer Andy McCluskey told us , `` Apart from loving the first 2 Roxy Music albums , Eno was our hero because he taught how to make interesting music on ordinary instruments .
We could n't afford synths in the early days .
He also championed music on cheap instruments .
That 's all we had . ''
