When Take That 's Gary Barlow was asked by BBC Children in Need organizers to come-up with an idea for their 2011 official single , he came up with covering Massive Attack 's 1998 single , `` Teardrop . ''
To record the new version , Barlow assembled a group featuring some of UK 's leading urban artists , including Ed Sheeran , Rizzle Kicks , N-Dubz , Miss Dynamite , Wretch 32 , Tinchy Stryder , Mz Bratt and Dot Rotton .
The artists were mainly suggested by Barlow 's fellow X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos and the Take That member confessed to The Guardian that there were `` a couple '' that he had n't heard of .
Barlow 's Children In Need all-star supergroup was christened after The Sun asked its readers to suggest names and the newspaper was inundated with suggestions .
Barlow said one name stood out and `` The Collective '' was adopted as their moniker .
Barlow recruited to produce the track Labrinth , who is the knob twiddler on Tinie Tempah 's hit singles `` Pass Out '' and `` Frisky . ''
Labrinth told The Sun : `` It 's not a your usual cheesy or comical Children In Need record .
It 's a bit more meaningful .
Gary wanted it to be more urban , which is why he came to me , and I 've worked with most of the artists .
He wanted it to be an honest record and come from somewhere else .
`` Barlow added : `` Children In Need has a history of doing upbeat singles with comedians but it 's a serious charity doing a lot of hard work for serious causes .
It 's time to do something with artists who young people actually listen to .
I 've done these things before , I 'm used to doing group situations , I like it - it 's a challenge .
It has n't been easy .
But bless him , Labrinth and his manager have been the key to the whole thing . ''
