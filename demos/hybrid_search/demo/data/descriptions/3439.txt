This is the opening track from alternative metal band Drowning Pool 's self-titled fourth studio album .
Guitarist C.J. Pierce told Artist Direct : `` It 's a fan song ; it 's a people song .
We all go through good times and bad times .
We all feel like s -- t or we all have a great day .
It 's an anthem .
It 's a rock song that just includes fans as part of it .
That 's the whole idea about it .
We all have those days , and we all feel it together . ''
