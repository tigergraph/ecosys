Lyrically , Little Broken Hearts is a break-up album , and the record finds Jones exorcising the ghost of the failed relationship in a variety of different reactions .
For example , this song is the first hint of her anger and bitterness at her beau 's failings .
Sonically , this is the most far-reaching track Jones has recorded to date .
She told The Sun : `` That 's one of my proudest moments .
It sounds electronic but it was actually a live track and I play bass on it . ''
Jones teamed up with Brian `` Danger Mouse '' Burton , the multi-instrumentalist/producer best known for his work with Gnarls Barkley , for the set .
When the singer arrived in L.A. ready to work with him , she brought with her several new tunes that she 'd penned in the wake of her failed romance .
`` I never really intended to write about -LSB- my breakup -RSB- and it 's still kind of encrypted , '' Jones told Exclaim !
Magazine .
`` We 've all gone through things and had those moments .
Whether you 're going through a breakup that 's serious or casual or you 're jealous of something .
We 've all had twinges of these feelings at some point .
Or , the older you get , you will .
It became more about me and Brian being a little bit more philosophical about relationships .
We definitely got inside each other 's heads .
I would n't have been able to write these kinds of songs with somebody I did n't know that well .
We would take a feeling and kind of run with it ... but the album 's not a diary .
I was never nervous about writing it , because I know what 's real and what 's not . ''
UK newspaper The Independent on Sunday asked Jones if her ex knows which songs on Little Broken Hearts are about him ?
She replied , faltering : `` Yeah , it 's fine , it 's totally ... yeah , '' before adding .
`` He probably knows what 's real and what 's not more than anyone .
I 'm not too worried about it . ''
