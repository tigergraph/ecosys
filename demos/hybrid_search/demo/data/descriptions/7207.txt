This is the first single from New York based indie pop singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson 's 4th studio album , Everybody .
Everybody is a 12 song cycle chronicling an intense and volatile relationship , which is based on true live events .
This is the final track in which the relationship has been dissolved .
Having completed her emotional pilgrimage , Michaelson acknowledges the future 's uncertainty but also discovers the prospect of revived love .
She declared : `` This is my big girl record .
It 's almost a loss of innocence .
I 'm 29 years old and I should n't worry if my mom and dad know that I kissed a boy from listening to one of my songs ... This album is very autobiographical , it 's about the past year-and-a-half of my life and choices that I 've made . ''
