Dave wrote this when he was starting to become famous .
Along with his fame came other people 's greed .
Many people were grabbing for as much money as they could get , and forgot about the real meaning of the music .
The song shows how Dave was saddened by it .
Key lines include , `` All at once the ghosts come back '' and `` Remember when I used to play for all of the loneliness that nobody notices now '' .

-LRB- thanks , David - Charlottesville , VA -RRB-
