Most of the regulations that govern boxing today are based on 12 famous rules drawn up in 1867 by John Sholto Douglas , the 8th Marquess of Queensberry , who was a patron of the sport .
His innovations changed boxing completely .
They provided for the use of padded gloves , canvas and stipulated the length of each round at three minutes with a one-minute interval .
In this song , Turner calls for violent teens to throw their knives into the Thames .
He explained to The Sun May 1 , 2009 : `` Violence , as a whole , is pretty futile .
It 's important because I really believe that something needs to be said about the current fad that rules the streets of London right now .
We need to bring our troops home , end the second Vietnam we are a part of and focus on saving the lives of the teenagers being killed right on our doorsteps . ''
Gallows vocalist Frank Carter -LRB- From Kerrang !
magazine April 18 , 2009 -RRB- : `` They are boxing rules and this song is about knife crime .
I 'm harking back to a better day where men could settle disputes like men , and get in the ring and sort it out in ten rounds .
Nowadays , if you think you have a problem with someone - before you 've even had the chance to sort it out - they have stabbed you from behind and you 'll probably die .
There is no honour or anything gentlemanly about that .
When kids are finding a reason to carry a knife to school , then you have to realise this is the war that we should be fighting .
Not in Iraq - but on the streets of London - making sure that our children are safe . ''
