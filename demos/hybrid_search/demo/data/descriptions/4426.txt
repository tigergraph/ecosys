This is about Chris Cornell 's life and how he regrets some things in his past .
Some lyric analysis : `` Born too young '' - Cornell had immature views in his former career as a lyricist and singer .
`` Top of my lungs '' - He sang in a high-pitched voice when he was in early Soundgarden .
`` Sitting on the bottom rug '' - On the back of the Louder Than Love CD , there is a portrait of a band , and there is a transparent rug over them .
