This is a track from British boy band JLS ' self-titled debut album .
In 2010 a re-mixed version featuring rapper Chipmunk was released as the b-side to the boys ' 2010 single , `` The Club Is Alive . ''
Marvin Humes told The Daily Record about the song : `` The synths at the beginning take me back to Eighties Old Skool .
It 's about having your last night with someone before they leave you . ''
JLS wrote this tune with the Danish production/songwriting team DEEKAY who have written and produced for artists like Diddy , Allison Iraheta , Fat Joe , Orianthi , Mis-Teeq , Ashley Tisdale .
On the track-by-track commentary that comes with the album on iTunes , the boys said they wrote the song within a couple of hours in west London .
Marvin explained the band 's name to PopEater : `` JLS stands for Jack the Lad Swing , and originally we had invented this name as a genre of music that we developed by taking an American style of music -LRB- New Jack Swing -RRB- with British swagger -LRB- Jack the Lad -RRB- and merged the two .
We were originally called UFO but had to change our name , so we though it made sense to change our name to what was originally our style of music !
JLS ! ''
