In this song Dylan speaks to a nation tired of being at war .
Many commentators have noted the war theme on Seeing Things and drawn comparison to his father 's early songs such as `` A Hard Rain 's A-Gonna Fall . ''
Jakob told The Sun July 25,2008 : `` I think the concept of war is timeless .
There 's physical war and there 's emotional war and the imagery is boundless .
I come to it not from a political perspective but as a human concern . ''
Rick Rubin produced this song along with the rest of the album .
