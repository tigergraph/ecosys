This song is about a dying relationship .
It was produced by R&B / pop production duo The Underdogs .
They are best known for producing the soundtrack for the musical Dreamgirls .
This was the first ever single by an American Idol winner to reach the Top 3 of the UK singles chart .
The previous best placing had been Sparks ' reality show contemporary Kelly Clarkson , who peaked at # 5 with `` Since U Been Gone . ''
This spent seven weeks at # 1 on the New Zealand singles chart , and was the best selling song of 2008 in that country .
It also topped the charts in Australia and Israel .
`` No Air '' is a duet with Sparks ' label mate Chris Brown .
They originally met at the 2007 BET Awards when the former American Idol winner suggested that they work together .
Sparks admitted to Live Daily that she recorded her vocal separately to Brown : `` Unfortunately I did n't actually get to work with him , which was really sad .
I was supposed to be there .
We had set the whole thing up .
But there was a mix-up and I was at another studio recording a different song .
And he was across town recording ` No Air , ' so it was really sad .
But I got to see him at the American Music Awards and that was the first time I saw him since he laid his vocal down .
I got to tell him thank you and all that good stuff .
He 's a really cool kid .
It 's very nice .
He 's very sweet .
He talked to my parents and my brother and made everybody feel really welcome . ''
In the UK chart for w/e July 5th 2008 Chris Brown was featured on two songs in the UK Top 5 , this tune and `` Forever . ''
It was the first time that an artist had achieved this feat since September 2003 , when Sean Paul was in the Top 5 , both as a featured artist on Blue Cantrell 's `` Breathe '' and on his own with `` Like Glue . ''
