This song is about sin and redemption that traverses the dark side of Los Angeles .
It references Christ 's parable of the prodigal son , who after running away and squandering his share of his father 's inheritance , returns and is welcomed back by his forgiving dad .
The father then celebrates his repentant son 's homecoming by organizing a feast .
Another biblical allusion in this song is the first line , `` as I walk through the valley of the shadow of LA , '' which references a line from the 23rd -LRB- `` The Lord Is My Shepherd '' -RRB- Psalm , `` though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death . ''
This song features the vocalist M. Shadows and guitarist Synyster Gates from Avenged Sevenfold .
It was the first time Good Charlotte has officially collaborated with other artists on an album .
Frontman Joel Madden explained about the collaboration on goodcharlotte.com : `` We 've been friends with Avenged for a long time .
This was n't planned , but it ended up working out .
We were sitting around listening to some new music and they liked that song so we asked them to jump on .
It felt right and sounded really cool .
Aside from being friends of ours , we 're also fans of their music and since this is our first collaboration , we could n't be happier that they 're a part of our record . ''
