This propulsive rocker features Peaches on vocals .
The band hooked up with the Canadian Electro-diva after vocalist Michael Stripe bumped into her in a Berlin bar .
The song features added guitar from veteran musician/producer and long-time Patti Smith collaborator Lenny Kaye .
Said Peter Buck to Mojo magazine : `` Lenny nailed it .
I 'm really proud that I get to play with a guy who 's been such a big influence on my life .
With the exception of the Beatles and Stones , anyone I 've ever respected since 1972 I 've played with : Bruce Springsteen , Neil Young , Patti Smith , Warren Zevon , Roger McGuinn , I 've played with The Replacements , Husker Du , John Fogerty ... to have actually been on stage playing guitar with these guys - man , how lucky did I get ? ''
Stipe 's stream-of-conscious lyrics are summed up by the nonsensical song title .
It compares with another R.E.M. track with scattergun words , `` It 's the End of the World As We Know It . ''
