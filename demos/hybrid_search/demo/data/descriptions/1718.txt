Singer Max Bemis told Alternative Press that he penned this song at the tail-end of the relationship that was chronicled on In Defense Of the Genre .
`` This is the only song on this record that really references that time as the relationship was over and I began writing for this record , '' he explained .
`` I was going through the stage with this person where you 're trying to be cordial and be friends , but it 's too weird and you both eventually just have to cut it off - or one person has to .
In this particular instance , this relationship was really unhealthy and had a really negative effect on me and my self-worth .
Cutting off this relationship was a spiritual act of self-empowerment . ''
`` When you listen to In Defense Of the Genre , you can tell that there was more to it than just being someone 's fault , '' Bemis continued .
`` It had to do with me placing myself in a situation because I felt bad about myself or felt bad about things in society .
I wanted to solve the world 's problems by trying to help this one person and help them overcome certain things that they just never would .
`` The cool thing about ` Eloise ' is that it 's not just a break-up song , '' he added , `` but a getting-over-a-girl song .
It talks a lot about why we even get into these types of relationships and why letting go of them is such a good idea in terms of the biggest scope of spirituality and society .
This is kind of a running theme on the record .
While most songs on the record can be explained simply , there 's more to each song , and they talk about the grander issues in life .
This was definitely my closure song as well as my new-beginning song .
Because there has to be closure to the relationship before there can be a new beginning with someone else . ''
