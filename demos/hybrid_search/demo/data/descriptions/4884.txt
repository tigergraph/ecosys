This song is about reaching your potential .
Everyone has secrets they keep in their own head about themselves , and we rarely confront those secrets .
It 's a self reflecting song : `` Is someone getting the best , the best , the best of you '' could be interpreted as asking yourself a question you do n't really want to think about .

What an honor to be covered by one of your heroes . ''
