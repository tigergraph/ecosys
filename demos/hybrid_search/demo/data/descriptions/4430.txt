This simple ballad anchored by Country-Gospel piano features a classic Cohen sentiment : `` Show me the place where the Word became a man / Show me the place where the suffering began , '' he whispers .
Cohen penned the song with Patrick Leonard , who is best known for co-writing many of Madonna 's late '80s hits .
The song features backing vocals from singer-songwriter Jennifer Warnes , whose biggest hits include two Oscar winning duets : `` Up Where We Belong '' -LRB- with Joe Cocker , from An Officer and a Gentleman -RRB- and '' '' -LRB- I 've Had -RRB- The Time of My Life '' -LRB- with Bill Medley from Dirty Dancer -RRB- .
In 1971 , she met Cohen , and they became lifelong friends .
Warnes has toured Europe with Cohen 's band and featured as vocal arranger and guest singer on many of his albums .
In 1987 she recorded the LP Famous Blue Raincoat , which was made up entirely of Cohen-penned songs .
The song is one of four tracks on Old Ideas that Leonard helped Cohen to pen .
The Canadian singer-poet was appreciative of his songwriting partner 's talent .
He told Mojo magazine : `` His musical sense is so inventive , so imaginative and so appropriate , and he has no ego in this process .
If you do n't like something , he does n't argue for it .
And when I understood the level at which he was working , I was also ready to reconsider a lyric - which I 'm usually not ready to do , because by the time I get something I give to somebody to look at , it has already gone through a lot of changes and permutations .
But working with Pat , his approach was so delicate - perhaps we needed another word in a line ?
- And the combinations he made were so appropriate to the lyric , I would very seriously consider an accommodation he suggested . ''
