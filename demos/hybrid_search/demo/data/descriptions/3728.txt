American indie rock singer-songwriter Liz Phair 's debut album , Exile in Guyville was a song-by-song reply to the Rolling Stones ' 1972 record , Exile on Main Street and this song corresponds to `` Rip This Joint . ''
Phair explained how to Rolling Stone : '' ` Rip This Joint ' is totally about their lifestyle and I 'm like , sitting in the apartment when these rock stars come in being like , and look at the mess you make , I feel extremely uncomfortable with you here .
It was Nash -LSB- Kato -RSB- and Blackie -LSB- Onassis -RSB- and all those guys from Urge Overkill and Material Issue and stuff .
I 'm like , did you guys not realize how you impact me ?
` Soul Survivor ' is such a song about like , coming through on the other end , battered , bashed , but kind of at peace with it .
And so is the last song on my record .
It 's sort of saying , all right , I understand my part in this , and I do n't really understand it either .
The first song is an accusation and the last song is yes , I 've played a part in this too . ''
