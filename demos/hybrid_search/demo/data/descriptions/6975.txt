This Reggae-tinged jam finds Rihanna paying tribute to her Barbados heritage in much the same way as 2010 's `` Man Down '' did .
Rihanna co-penned the song herself one of eleven Unapologetic tracks that she helped co-write .
She only had four songwriting credits on her previous album , Talk That Talk and none on the one before that , Loud .
