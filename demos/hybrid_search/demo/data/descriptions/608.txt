This features The-Dream singing the chorus with frontman Travis McCoy .
Drummer Matt McGinley told Artist Direct that the band titled the album The Quilt because , `` it feels like a musical patchwork of different influences and songs . ''
With a hit record under their belt , Gym Class Heroes felt free to take more chances on The Quilt album and on this song in particular .
McCoy said , `` I feel like we 've proven ourselves at this point , which is why we can make a song like ` Cookie Jar . '
The last thing we wanted to do was go into this record with a preconceived vibe ; instead we just wanted to write songs that felt good to us -- and if they 're cohesive and well-written you wo n't have to worry about if they do n't all sound alike . ''
This adulterous analogy is about those who want to be faithful , but ca n't keep their hands out the cookie jar .
Some people have interpreted this song as an admission of infidelity by Travis McCoy in his relationship with Katy Perry .
The GCH frontman told MTV News : `` I 've gotten a lot of flak in interviews like , ` You know , you 're talking about cheating , but you 're with Katy right now . '
And I 'm like , ` Yeah , but the song was written before . '
And not only that , but like , if I can deal with her singing about kissing girls all day , she can deal with me singing about eating cookies for a little while . ''
