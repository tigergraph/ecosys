This Missy Elliott-produced track is the lead single from American singer Monica 's sixth studio album , Still Standing .
The song 's music video was shot by director Benny Boom in Los Angeles on February 8 , 2010 , and was inspired by the Beyonc√© film , Obsessed .
The clip features Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chad Ochocinco as Monica 's love interest .
Ochocinco was Chad Johnson before legally changing is surname to his nickname , which is a reference to his number : 85 .
Monica is the fifth act to have garnered # 1 R&B singles in three decades , the others being Michael Jackson , Janet Jackson , James Brown and Marvin Gaye .
Jazmine Sullivan , Cainon Lamb and Missy Elliott wrote the song , which incorporates elements of Denise Williams ' recording of `` Silly , '' a # 53 hit for her in 1981 .
Monica explained to PopEater who chose the sample : `` It was Missy -LSB- Elliott -RSB- .
I 'm an eighties baby all day , and Missy like to hear me sing over those older beats .
So anytime she works with me , she goes in the crates and finds those songs that ring true to that era .
That 's what she did this time around . ''
This was Monica 's sixth # 1 on the R&B / Hip-Hop Songs chart , and her first in close to seven years .
Her previous chart-topper on that tally was `` So Gone , '' which began a five-week reign in June 2003 .
