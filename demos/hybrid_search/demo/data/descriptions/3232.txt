Little Hell was the third album released by the Canadian musician Dallas Green as City and Colour .
`` Fragile Bird '' was the big hit from the album , setting a record for the most non-consecutive weeks at # 1 on the Canadian Alternative Rock Chart .
Green says he chose the song as a single because it 's different and weird .
With Little Hell , he believed that he 'd grown as an artist and that picking this song to put out to radio would be a good test to see if people were ready to grow with him , which they were - Green got a fantastic response to the song .
When talking to Aux TV about the video for this song , City and Colour 's Dallas Green joked that it was his `` Hip-Hop video '' and that `` it was time to make a video with a bunch of babes in it . ''
Michael Maxxis , who 's also directed videos for Billy Talent and Alexisonfire , says his vision for the video for this song aligned with City & Colour 's music and tastes .
Maxxis came up with the idea of shooting in an empty , abandoned room , which he describes as `` subtle , sexy , and dark . ''
City & Colour 's Dallas Green says this song is about the night terrors experienced by his wife , the TV personality Leah Miller .
Green says she gets them `` all the time '' and that although they can be funny , they 're `` mostly really spooky . ''
In 2011 , the CBC 's Hockey Night in Canada used this song during the intro for game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Vancouver Canucks and the Boston Bruins .
