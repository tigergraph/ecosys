This is third single by the American Pop-Punk band Runner Runner , from their self-titled debut studio album .
The band discussed the song in a track-by-track interview with http://PropertyOfZack: `` Rather than sing another broken-hearted ballad , we decided to write an ode to falling in love , and going great lengths to help that special someone realize their dream .
We want to pay tribute to the tradition of awesome power-pop ballads about a girl named Allison . ''
