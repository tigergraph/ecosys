Frontwoman Jehnny Beth dedicated this twisted tale of `` doing things with you that I would never tell my mum '' to her boyfriend and co-producer of Silence Yourself , Johnny Hostile .
The black-and-white video was helmed by French director Antoine Carlier , who previously collaborated with the band on their artwork .
It was filmed on the beaches of Gironde in South-West France and was inspired by a murder scene in Albert Camus ' novel The Stranger .
The clip shows two men played by Leo Pochat and Richard Duval fighting on a vacant beach to a tragic end .
Savages explained `` We wanted to make a video that focused on a timeless human physicality and physical expression , a search for understanding through the movement , action and reaction of two characters .
We chose the classical landscape of the empty beach .
A fight ensues between two men : one older , one younger ; a tragic outcome , and death . ''
Camus published The Stranger in 1942 .
It describes how the main character seemingly irrationally kills an Arab man whom he recognises in French Algiers .
The Cure 's debut single , `` Killing An Arab , '' was inspired by the same novel .
