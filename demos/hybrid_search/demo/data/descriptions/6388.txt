This is the opening track from the British indie group Kasabian 's fourth studio album , Velociraptor ! .
Guitarist and principal songwriter Serge Pizzorno told Q magazine : `` We 've always started each album off with a banger , ` Club Foot , ' 'Em pire ' ` Underdog . '
This time we wanted to do something different .
It 's a mental tune .
All the classic albums draw you in and that 's what ` Let 's Roll ' ... does . ''
The song describes two kids on a wasteland looking to the horizon .
Pizzorno told Q they are the young him and Tom -LRB- Meighan , vocals -RRB- .
`` The song 's kind of a love letter to Tom , really .
That 's us on the farm where we lived when we were writing our first album .
Smoking weed morning , noon and night .
We 'd sit out looking for aliens . ''
