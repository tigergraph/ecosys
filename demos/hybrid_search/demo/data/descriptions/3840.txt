This song was co-written and produced by Tony Kanal , who is the bassist for the American rock band No Doubt .
His musical work outside of the band includes producing and songwriting for his fellow No Doubt bandmate Gwen Stefani , among others .
Shontelle explained to Sound-Savvy about this collaboration with Kanal : `` We wanted to make a song that does n't sound like anything else .
I feel like that is what really establishes you as an artist and really sets you apart .
They were just like `` No , we know you can sing .
We know you have swag .
We know you can deliver .
But you need to do something that is really going to make people 's ears perk up like oh , what 's that ? '' .
That was what we really were attempting on that one and I 'm really happy that the feedback has been so good . ''
