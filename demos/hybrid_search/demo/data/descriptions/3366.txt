`` All For Leyna '' is of course written by Billy Joel , as the fifth track on his seventh album Glass Houses .
This is the same album that produced the hit singles `` You May Be Right , '' `` It 's Still Rock And Roll To Me , '' `` Do n't Ask Me Why , '' and `` Sometimes A Fantasy . ''
The other four singles scored higher.Glass Houses was produced by Phil Ramone -LRB- no relation to the band -RRB- .
Ramone is the technically brilliant South African prodigy who began playing the violin at age three and performing for Queen Elizabeth II at age ten .
Amongst his innovations , his studio - A&R Recording - was the first to release an album on compact disk -LRB- not the first to be recorded , however , just the first to get commercial release -RRB- .
That album ?
None other than Billy Joel 's 52nd Street .
Ramone in fact has worked closely with Billy Joel on and off in his career.Getting back to Glass Houses , this album garnered Joel a Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance .
The album art has Billy Joel poised to throw a rock through what is actually the front of his own house , in Oyster Bay , New York .
He moved there in 1977 , after getting turned down for residency by the legendary Dakota apartments , traditional home to celebrity stars in New York .
The Dakota 's board has drawn criticism for its snobbery in recent years .
Other people to be rejected by the Dakota staff include Melanie Griffith , Antonio Banderas , and Gene Simmons .
