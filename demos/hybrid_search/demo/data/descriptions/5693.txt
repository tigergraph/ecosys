Toby Keith wrote this song over the 2009 Christmas break .
He discussed the cut on his website : `` I absolutely loved the melody , but the idea is probably something I 've said or heard and it stuck with me .
I ca n't remember where or why , but I just thought it was funny to say , `` Yeah , you 're gone and I do n't miss you too much , but I think about you all the time . ''
Which is basically the same thing .
He 's willing to admit he heard she 's in town with a handsome man , but says he did n't catch it all .
He caught it second-hand .
Well , of course it was second-hand if you heard it from somebody .
There 's a lot of that kind of doubling back in the song .
I wrote one years ago that went , `` We 'd still be together , but she left me . ''
Well , of course !
Those kinds of things crack me up . ''
