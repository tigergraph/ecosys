This is the first single and title track from American country music artist Jason Michael Carroll 's third album .
The record was released by QuarterBack/GrassRoots/Cracker Barrel partnership and sold exclusively through Cracker Barrel stores .
Said Carroll : '' ` Numbers ' is a song that got my attention the first time I heard it .
It was written by Patrick Davis and Rodney Clausen and it 's about the way certain numbers , like dates and times , can represent some of life 's most significant moments .
Moments like your first date , meeting the love of your life and the day your child is born .
Those dates and times have real meaning in our lives .
I think everyone can identify with that concept .
Most numbers mean absolutely nothing but some of them , like the date you meet the person you are going to spend the rest of your life with , mean everything . ''
