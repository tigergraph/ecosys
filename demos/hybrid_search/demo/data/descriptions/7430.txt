This is made up of two songs , `` Mass Hysteria '' and `` Modern World . ''
Vocalist and chief songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong explained to Q magazine May 2009 : `` It swirls all the information that 's going on in the record around in an emotional blender .
At the end it 's going to sound like a wall of TV screens .
It 's sensory overload . ''
Green Day were recording the drums for this two-part song on election night in November 2009 , when Barack Obama was elected president .
Drummer Tr√© Cool recalled to Q magazine May 2009 : `` It was pretty insane .
We were running in and telling Butch -LRB- Vig , producer -RRB- , Yeah , we got another state ! ''
Cool added that the song title is `` kind of fitting , especially if Obama would have lost .
We 'd be busy trying to start a revolution if McCain had won . ''
