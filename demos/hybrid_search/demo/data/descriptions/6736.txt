The Performance features eleven tracks each written by a different songwriter .
This closing track was written by The Pet Shop Boys .
Billboard magazine asked Dame Shirley if she had a favorite track on The Performance .
She replied : `` I love all of them .
But the Pet Shop Boys ' song got right into my head and made me sob , and not many songs do that .
You can get too carried away with a song , especially onstage , but you ca n't be crying during every one .
When I heard that , after doing all the other songs , it was just too much for me .
I do n't need to write a book .
The record is my autobiography . ''
