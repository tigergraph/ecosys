Joe Goddard -LRB- vocals , synthesizer and percussion -RRB- told The NME February 6 , 2010 : '' -LRB- Guitarist -RRB- Al Doyle plays the flugelhorn , which he learned especially .
He has this incredible but annoying ability of being able to pick up an instrument and play it immediately , which if you were a superhero would be a rubbish power , but as a musician it 's good .
`` Another example of the use of the flugelhorn in popular music is by American bebop trumpeter Marvin Stamn 's on Paul McCartney 's `` Uncle Albert - Admiral Halsey . ''
The song features the additional vocals of Charles Hayward from 1970s prog-rockers This Heat .
Taylor told Pitchfork : `` Charles Hayward plays and sings harmony on ` Slush , ' and that 's one of the most special things about the album for me because he 's someone that I really look up to and love .
It was exciting that he really wanted to do it , and that his children were excited that he was going to play on a Hot Chip album .
`` Taylor added that he felt that the song 's backing vocals sounded like a vocal exercise , using `` the same cadence as many very famous melodies '' and he likened it to Willie Nelson 's `` Crazy . ''
Vocalist Alexis Taylor wrote this ambient ballad in a 6/8 time signature .
A number of the tunes on One Life Stand were inspired by the birth of Taylor 's daughter , Prudence .
He told Rolling Stone that he worked on many of the melodies in the company of his newborn at home .
`` I would play piano while holding her with the other hand , '' he said .
`` That was such a nice feeling . ''
