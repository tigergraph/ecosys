The inspiration for this song came from Scottish singer Amy MacDonald 's admiration for the actor Jake Gyllenhaal .
On BBC Berkshire she explained : `` Well I was just thinking and I thought everyone has somebody that they idolize - be it an actor or a sports player or a singer or whatnot .
But I think in general that people should value their own dreams and their own achievements , even if we do n't do things as great as being in a Hollywood blockbuster .
Just be proud of what we achieve ourselves . ''
The Glaswegian singer / songwriter admitted on her internet blog that she never really liked this song much herself .
She wrote on her MySpace : `` So I 've thrown myself right back in at the deep end and have been rewarded with a lovely chart position of 48 !
It 's more embarrassing than anything else .
If I 'm honest I really do n't like ` LA ' all that much and do n't think it represents the album one bit . ''
Since then her UK chart placing improved by 7 places after being played on both the UK 's top viewed soaps , EastEnders and Coronation Street .
The song was more successful in her native Scotland , peaking at # 5 .
