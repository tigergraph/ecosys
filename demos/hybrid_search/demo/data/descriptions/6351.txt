On this song about a lost wallet , Spektor sings about tracking down its owner via their Blockbuster Video card .
Spin magazine asked if this actually happened to her ?
She replied : `` Well , I do n't want to destroy someone 's relationship with my songs by talking about them - why limit something that could be so limitless ?
But the one thing about that song that perplexes me the most is what 's going to happen in 10 years .
Will anyone even know what the hell I 'm talking about ?
Do you think Blockbuster will even exist anymore ? ''
This was one of the tracks on Far that was produced by Jeff Lynne , who Spektor requested after discovering he produced Tom Petty 's Highway Companion album .
Spektor told Pitchfork Media : `` I wrote that song a bunch of years ago and I remember playing it on tour and thinking , ` Do they even know what Blockbuster is in other countries ? '
Now I might need to change it to Netflix .
-LSB- laughs -RSB- It 's like one of those songs that you listen to from the 20s and ask , ` What 's a kaputnik ? '
It 's this thing that was obviously very important because they 're singing about it , but it just does n't exist anymore .
That 's why Bach and Mozart had it right by not putting in any words and making timeless instrumental music .
In 300 years , when our great-great-great-grandchildren are checking out music by putting their finger into entertainment sockets , they 're not going to know what ` Blockbuster ' or ` Netflix ' or ` Juicy Fruit ' are .
They 'll be like , ` What 's fruit ? '
They 'll probably be living in a cement pod and eating food through intravenous tubes .
They 're not going to know any of this s -- t. ''
