This retro confessional has been around for a while - Monroe started the tune when she was seventeen and was helped by singer-songwriter Lori McKenna and frequent Taylor Smith collaborator Liz Rose .
The song finds Monroe addressing more than just a hangover , though .
`` Obviously , the first thing you think about a `` Morning After '' is when you 've drank too much , and most of us have been through , '' she told Billboard magazine .
`` But , it could also be about heartbreak in general .
Anytime you go through one , and you wake up the morning after , it hurts .
I think you just keep going through the morning after , as it never stops coming . ''
When Monroe is singing one of her songs she sees `` it like a movie '' in her head .
She explained to The Boot : `` That 's why a lot of times I close my eyes when I 'm singing .
I 've had people tell me before , ` Open your eyes . '
I do , but sometimes when I 'm so deep in a song , like ` Morning After , ' when I 'm singing it , it almost physically hurts because I feel it so much and I see the same scene in my head every time .
So if you see be closing my eyes , it 's because I 'm living it . ''
