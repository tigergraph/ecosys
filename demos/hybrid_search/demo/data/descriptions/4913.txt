Speaking with MTV News in February 2013 , frontman Nate Ruess said that the song is , `` about constantly being on the move . ''
He added , `` That is something that we 've been for the last ten years , but more so this year than any , '' Ruess said .
`` For example , right now , I live nowhere .
I do n't have an apartment , I do n't have anything .
-LSB- In the past -RSB- , I moved from Phoenix to New York , and now I 'm moving from New York to who knows where ?
But it 's all I 've known , so I 'm used to it . ''
The song 's music video was filmed in Seattle and finds the band following the path of a lost piece of luggage .
`` I think there 's a lot of metaphors in -LSB- the clip -RSB- that you could draw with us and the past year we 've had , but it 's a video that I hope will make people feel very different the next time they go to the airport and give their bag away , '' guitarist Jack Antonoff told MTV News .
`` It 's a very serious video that , on paper , might seem a little tongue in cheek , but at least the way it 's written , it 's meant to be pretty deep .
`` And I think that 's OK , it 's exciting and it 's valuable for the fans of the music to know that , that it 's not just this giant dream sequence , '' he continued .
`` There 's a level of sacrifice that makes it worth it even more ; so , to me , there 's a romanticism to it , when you look at the dark side . ''
