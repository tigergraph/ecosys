Written by Police drummer Stewart Copeland , this song seems to be about all the things that life throws at us , and the problems we face on a really bad day .
We could deal with them all , if only on any other day .
-LRB- thanks , Pippin - Rhye , CA -RRB- From the book MTV Ruled the World - The Early Years of Music Video , here 's Stewart Copeland talking about the early days of music videos at the dawn of MTV : `` Up until that point , videos were not an art form .
The only place I 'd seen them was in England , on shows like Top of the Pops .
When there would be an American group that actually could n't show up , they would send video , which was usually just a camera following a band around a park while they walk around , and someone says , ` Hey , get an ice cream !
Let 's have all the lads eating ice cream ! '
They were sort of like Monkees ' videos . ''
