Spiteri wrote and recorded this album after splitting with her boyfriend Ashley Heath , the father of the singer 's daughter Misty Kyd .
A number of the tracks , including this one , reflect on their breakup .
She told the Daily Record May 10 , 2008 : `` The lyrics are pretty hardcore .
` Something inside just died - it was YOU . '
That 's quite tough .
When I told -LRB- producer -RRB- Bernard -LRB- Butler -RRB- it was going to be the first track , he said , ` You 're brave ' .
But I do n't think it is because it says a lot about what the album is about .
I 'm proud of the fact it sounds very ` now ' but it still sounds different because it 's coming from an older woman 's perspective . ''
