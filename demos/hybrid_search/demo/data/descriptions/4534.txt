In Rolling Stone magazine , Springsteen explained : `` The song ` Magic ' is about living in a time when anything that is true can be made to seem like a lie , and anything that is a lie can be made to seem true .
There are people that have taken that as their credo .
The classic quote was from one of the Bushies in The New York Times : ` We make our own reality .
You guys report it , we make it . '
I may loathe that statement - the unbelievable stupidity and arrogance of it - more than I loathe ` Bring it on ' and ` Mission accomplished . '
That song , it 's all about illusion .
That 's the heart of my record right there . ''
Magic won for Best Rock Album at the 2008 Grammy Awards .
