This was one of two original songs on Bob Dylan 's eponymous first album .
It describes his feelings on arriving in New York , and the initial difficulty he had finding gigs .
The line , `` Now , a very great man once said .
That some people rob you with a fountain pen , '' is a nod to Dylan 's hero Woody Guthrie .
It is a specific reference to `` Pretty Boy Floyd , '' Guthrie 's 1939 ballad about the 1930s gangster .
