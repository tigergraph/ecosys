Atoms For Peace is an Electro-Rock supergroup comprising Radiohead vocalist Thom Yorke , Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea , longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich , drummer Joey Waronker and percussionist Mauro Refosco .
Yorke originally formed the group to play live the songs from his laptop-driven 2006 solo album , The Eraser , but they were so good in rehearsal that Yorke arranged for three days of studio recording in Los Angeles .
After taking a break in the first part of 2011 whilst Radiohead released and toured their The King of Limbs album , the quintet got together to record their debut album , Amok .
This is Atom For Peace 's debut single , which was released as a digital download on September 10 , 2012 .
The band took its name from a song on Eraser , which itself was taken from a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower .
On Atom For Peace 's website , under their name , is the Cornish phrase `` Nerth Nuclerek ?
Na Vynnav , '' which translates as `` Nuclear Energy ?
I Do n't Want . ''
The song originated with a mistake on a sampler in Yorke 's studio .
He told Rolling Stone : `` I had n't patched it in right .
It was giving me a tone that , when I put it with a melody , I was like ` That 's nice ! '
I had that when Nigel and I were doing The Eraser . ''
The song 's music video finds Thom Yorke and contemporary dancer Fukiko Takase engaged in some avant garde moves in an empty auditorium .
The clip was conceived and directed by Garth Jennings and choreographed by Wayne McGregor , the same team who were behind Yorke 's manic dancing in the visual for Radiohead 's `` Lotus Flower . ''
