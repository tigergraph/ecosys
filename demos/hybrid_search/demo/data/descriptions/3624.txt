This song 's title `` Diamonds and Coal '' represents how a relationship between a couple may become or begin badly to symbolize coal .
We have to understand that there are trails and conflicts we encounter in a relationship , but if we try we can keep things together and go from coal to a diamond .
The song 's meaning is actually quite literal actual at one point , `` Love is n't perfect even diamonds start out as coal . ''
