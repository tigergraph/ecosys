Speaking about its concept JoJo said `` Were going to be seeing the inner workings of a relationship that starts off good and turns out to be disastrous , my boyfriend in this video is a motorcyclist so he runs a stoplight and there 's an accident and it 's not good '' .
JoJo explained to AOL Music that the song tackles the perils of a disastrous relationship . ''
` Disaster ' is basically about how sometimes you get so deep into a relationship , and it gets progressively horrifying and real disastrous , '' she explained .
`` Whether it be emotional abuse or another type of abuse , it 's like , ` How did I end up in this storm ? '
So it 's an emotional record , but it 's definitely resilient in the end . ''
