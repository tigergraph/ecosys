Vocalist Justin Young explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` It starts off describing a woman 's beauty , then when the chorus kicks in you realise ' I do n't want to f -- her , I want to be her . '
I was wondering if being beautiful made life any easier .
I 'm pretty sure it does n't , but it 's something I was exploring .
Say what you want about my lyrics , but I feel I 've been quite brave on this record . ''
Justin Young told NME : `` I wanted the title to be direct .
I wrote it on tour .
I was in Bridlington , looking out on the beach and the sea from the dressing room when I wrote the music , then the lyrics came when I was watching pretty girls walk by from my hotel window . ''
