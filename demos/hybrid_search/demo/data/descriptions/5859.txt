This is the title track of iCarly star Miranda Cosgrove 's second EP .
The song is a collaboration with Weezer 's Rivers Cuomo .
`` It 's the first duet I 've ever done , and it was really fun , '' Miranda told Billboard magazine .
`` My part of the song is this girl who 's high maintenance , and Rivers is this guy who 's having to put up with it .
I really enjoyed working with -LRB- Cuomo -RRB- .
He 's really cool .
I 've worked with Dr. Luke for a while , and he ended up introducing me to Rivers . ''
The song finds Miranda singing , `` So what if I break a few glasses , kick a few asses . ''
The iCarly actress told AOL that she 's not as difficult as the girl she portrays in the song : `` In a way , I felt like I was playing a character because I 'm definitely not that high maintenance but everybody has their moments where they kinda have a fit .
It was fun to be in the studio and play that .
The girl in the song is kinda a jerk so it was fun to get to be like that . ''
