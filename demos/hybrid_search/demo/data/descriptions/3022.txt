On this updated version of the classic folk tune , Pitbull spits lyrics about a provincial farm girl being coaxed to leave her shyness behind and catch up with the times .
He explained to Billboard magazine : `` It 's the same ` Guantanamera ' everyone knows but we flipped it .
We just made it modern .
And also , how should I say , humorous .
When I say ` no te hagas la guajira , deja eso en la finca . '
I 'm saying , ` C'mon baby you got ta catch up to the times ! '
Women now are independent , powerful and sexy . ''
