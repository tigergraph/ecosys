Williams sings here of a three day relationship unexpectedly cut short .
During an interview with NPR 's Bob Edwards , she was asked : `` Those Three Days , Somebody thought this was going to go on longer than that ? ''
Williams replied : `` Right but it did n't , and she was pretty hurt and angry , she had a chip on her shoulder about it and she needed to write a song about it to get it out of her system ... ` Scorpions call across my screen , ' you have to sort of read between the lines but that has to do with scorpion , as in Aquarius , Scorpio Whoever that is , yeah , he knows .
That got my point across .
That 's what happens when you get involved with a songwriter . ''
