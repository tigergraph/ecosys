This mid-tempo ballad is the second single from Country music artist Jason Michael Carroll 's second studio album , Growing Up Is Getting Old .
The song was written by Zane Williams , and was originally the title track of his 2005 album .
Williams ' rendition won him a $ 20,000 prize at the John Lennon Songwriting Contest .
The song is about a father who is very concerned about his daughter as she has ran away from home .
Carroll told Michigan radio station B93 that though he did n't write the song himself , it reminds him of a very personal and painful family situation .
He explained : `` My mom 's older sister , my Aunt Jean , ran away when I was two , from an abusive husband .
I remember for 16 years of my life we prayed for her .
Every night we said our prayers , and my mom would tag each prayer with , ` Please be with Aunt Jean wherever she 's at . '
`` Then during a Christmas get together at his grandmother 's house , the telephone rang .
Carroll recalled , `` I answered it .
The lady asked to speak to my grandmother .
About halfway through that conversation we realized she was speaking to her daughter that she had n't spoken to in 16 years . ''
