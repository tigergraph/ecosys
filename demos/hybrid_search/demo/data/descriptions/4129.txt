Jackson was going to do a remake of the Martha Reeves and the Vandellas ' 1965 hit `` Nowhere to Run , '' but Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , who were her songwriters and producers , suggested they do an original song with a similar beat , which meant they would keep more of the songwriting royalties .
Jam and Lewis pulled the word `` Escapade '' from a notebook they kept of song title ideas , and came up with the track while Jackson wrote the lyrics .
This album proved that Jackson 's previous release , the breakthrough album Control , was not a fluke .
Including this song , it brought her seven US Top-5 singles , an unheard of number of -LRB- Top-5 -RRB- hits for one album .
Jimmy Jam remembered how the song came together : `` While -LSB- Janet -RSB- was sitting in one room coming up with lyrics , I put it on the 24-track .
We hooked the drum machine up .
On my left hand I played the bass , on the right hand I played the chord .
And it was just enough for her to sing to , which we do a lot .
Because we like to let her sing to as minimum of a track as we can do , then fill in the track around her so that her part is the main part of the song .
With ` Escapade , ' she sang it and we kept saying we 'll go back and redo the track ... we never redid the track . ''
Former New Edition member Johnny Gill contributed finger snaps .
Jackson embarked on her very first concert tour - `` The Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 '' - the same week this song hit # 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 .
