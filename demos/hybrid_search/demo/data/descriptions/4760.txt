This song is a tribute to Kristofferson 's friend , the Irish singer Sinead O'Connor .
Kristofferson comforted O'Connor on stage in 1992 when she was booed by the crowd during a Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary concert a fortnight after tearing up a picture of the Pope on Saturday Night Live .
O'Connor regularly shaved her hair as a statement against the superficialities of the record industry , which Kristofferson alludes to in the lyric , `` that bald-headed brave little girl . ''
