This was inspired by the Walt Whitman -LRB- 1819 -- 1892 -RRB- poem called Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking , which came out around 1858 .
This poem is about loss and love and life then death , and the rhythm that is given to life from the beginning that continues throughout .
It is a grand and spectacular poem !
When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed and O Captain !
My Captain !
-LRB- 1866 -RRB- are two of Whitman 's more famous poems .
A poet who was ardently singing on life and himself , Whitman is today claimed as one of the few truly great American men of letters .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Mountlake Terrace , Washington , for all above -RRB- The `` sunbeam '' that illuminated a great deal of Whitman 's poetry was Music .
It was one of the major sources of his inspiration .
Many of his four hundred poems contain musical terms , names of instruments , and names of composers .
He insisted that music was `` greater than wealth , greater than buildings , ships , religions , paintings . ''
