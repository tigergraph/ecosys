One of Hatebreed 's most popular songs , this one opens with a drum intro followed by lead singer Jamey Jasta screaming : `` You f -- king bleed now . ''
The song started out as a joke , with the band playing up to their image as a group that leaves mayhem in their wake .
In out interview with Jasta , he explained : `` At that time everybody was saying that when we would get done with the show , there would be blood on the floor of the club every night of the tour , and blood in the bathrooms .
People would Twitter us pictures of blood in the sink of the club bathroom or blood on the floor or at the theater or the club or whatever .
So I said , ` I 'm just going to yell that . ' ''

Jasta tells us that there is more to this song than just the title .
`` I changed the lyrics so that it would be a little more meaningful , '' he said .
`` But the initial thing that I yell is what everybody latches onto .
Hopefully , they read the lyrics and they know that it 's not just about violence . ''
