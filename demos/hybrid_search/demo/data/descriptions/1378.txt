Katy said regarding On A Mission : `` It 's me , just as a young woman , partying , relationships ... the album 's definitely where I 'm coming from .
Tracks like ` Disappear ' and ` Easy Please Me ' are all experiences in my life and emotions that I 've felt . ''
Katy grumbles on this song : `` I love a bad boy mentality/But I do n't wan na be visiting no jail . ''
The NME asked her if this had been a problem in the past .
She replied : `` Look , I do n't want a guy who 's got an attitude problem but I want them to look after me .
If anyone fits that bill then they should , er , write in . ''

`` I just remember being in the vocal booth swaying , '' she blushed to the NME .
The song is n't about anybody in particular - just guys in general .
Katy told The Sun : '' ` Easy Please Me ' is about how men need to be honest about their intentions and not sleazy or creepy .
Most guys approach relationships all wrong . ''
