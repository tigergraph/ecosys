`` This one comes straight from my wife - girlfriend at the time , '' reveals Marc Roberge , founding member and front man for O.A.R. `` I 'd say to her , ` I 'm leaving on Wednesday for tour . '
And it 's always a very sensitive and tough situation .
But then I 'd always end up leaving Tuesday night at four in the morning or whatever .
And my way of justifying it was saying , ` Oh , I 'm leaving on Wednesday . '
And she would always say , ` Ca n't you just say you 're leaving Tuesday and just be honest about it ? '
It was kind of like this funny little thing we had .
So dareh meyod means `` it 's coming , '' and Sehshambeh dareh meyod means `` Tuesday is coming . ''
Because she 's Persian and she speaks Farsi , it was just a little ` Hey ' to her .
It 's basically a love song about having a hard time leaving , but saying the same road that takes me out will be the same one that 'll bring me back .
And the title 's kind of for her . ''
Roberge offers up a little lesson in Farsi : `` Shambeh is ` day , ' so Yekshambeh would be Monday , Sehshambeh ... in that order .
So it means Tuesday -- Sehshambeh .
` Tuesday is coming ' is what that little sentence means .
And I shortened it because I figured , why make it that hard ? ''
`` It 's pretty cool because we 'll be playing a show , and very rarely a couple of Persian people will come and they 'll always request that song .
They 're just like , ` It 's so cool , there 's no rock band with Persian words . ' ''
