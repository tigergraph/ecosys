This is a rewritten , re-recorded version of a song from Slipknot 's self-released CD Mate , Feed , Kill , Repeat .
Slipknot drummer Chris Fehn told us : `` That song was called ` Slipknot ' at the beginning .
It had some guitar solos in there that got X 'd out and I think it was a little slower back in the day .
You know , ` dun dun , dun dun dun , dun dun dun , dun dun dun dun . '
And then it got sped up . ''

The sample at the start , `` Here Come the Pain , '' was taken from the film Carlito 's Way , it occurs just as Al Pacino runs into an empty room after fleeing to the toilets - the scene is actually quite uneventful .
-LRB- thanks , Nick - Paramus , NJ , for above 2 -RRB- -LRB- sic -RRB- is a literary term which stands for `` said in context '' and is used to represent something that an author knows is wrong , but includes it in the writing anyway .
Lead singer Corey Taylor is a fan of Author Edgar Allen Poe 's work , who would use the term a lot .
