This song was inspired by Ned Sublette 's book , The World That Made New Orleans , which is about the connection between Haiti , Cuba , New Orleans , and the colonial and African slaves whose paths crossed there .
Frontman Joey Burns explained to Consequence of Sound : `` It 's a great book , and it got me thinking about this connection .
I never realized there was such a strong connection in the past between these cities and countries .
Having gone to Cuba , it reminded me of those parts of New Orleans that I love.You know , '' he continued , `` a strong sense of music , a strong sense of African influence , strong colonial architecture and stuff ... great food , great vibes .
So , on one of the songs , I wanted to bridge that influence , and that wound up being the song ` Sinner in the Sea , ' which was the first song that we were recording in Tucson that felt like we 've finally arrived here at material that I think is defining the heart of this new record . ''
