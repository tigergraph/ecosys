In a note posted on his website , Springsteen wrote about how he was energized to create a new album soon after Magic as a result of recording this song .
He explained : `` During the last weeks of mixing Magic , we recorded a song called ` What Love Can Do . '
It was sort of a ` love in the time of Bush ' meditation .
It was a great track but felt more like a first song of new record rather than something that would fit on Magic .
So our producer Brendan O'Brien said , ` Hey , let 's make another one right now ! '
I thought , no , I have n't done that since my first two records came out in the same year .
And usually I do n't write that quickly .
But that night I went back to my hotel in Atlanta and over the next week , I wrote several songs -LRB- `` This Life , '' `` My Lucky Day , '' `` Life Itself , '' along with `` Good Eye '' and `` Tomorrow Never Knows '' -RRB- that formed the beginnings of our new album .
Excited by the sounds we made on Magic I found there was more than enough fuel for the fire to keep going .
Brendan and I demo 'd these songs before we left the studio and agreed we 'd somehow find time during the touring year to get this record made . ''
