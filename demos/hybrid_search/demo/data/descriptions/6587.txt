This was the first single released from English trip hop musician Tricky 's debut album , Maxinquaye .
In 1991 , when Tricky was a member of Massive Attack , he met a 15-year-old girl named Martina Topley-Bird .
She mentioned to the musician that she could sing and they recorded this song together .
Tricky recalled to the NME September 4 , 2010 : `` I met Martina and we went down to the studio and recorded it .
It sat around for four years .
I used to play it to my cousin and she 'd say , ` You need to get this out . '
I pressed up 500 and put them around to Djs and then Island got in contact with me .
It was just playing around , really .
I was still considered being in Massive Attack .
I gave it to Massive Attack and they did n't like it , so I kept it .
`` The track was eventually released as Tricky 's debut solo single after he left Massive Attack , charting at # 69 in the UK .
By this time Martina Topley-Bird had become his girlfriend and muse and she was a featured vocalist on Maxinquaye .
Among the movies this song has appeared in are Alien Autopsy , Veronica Guerin and Silent Cry .
The song samples Marvin Gaye 's 1969 cover of the Isley Brothers ' song , `` That 's the Way Love Is . ''
Maxinquaye was named after Tricky 's late mother Maxine Quaye and it received great critical acclaim upon release .
Both the NME and Melody Maker ranked it the best CD of 1995 .
