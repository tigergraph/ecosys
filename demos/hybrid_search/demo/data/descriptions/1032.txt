Burn Halo is a hard rock band originating from Orange County , California and Tulsa , Oklahoma .
They comprise lead vocalist James Hart , lead guitarist Joey Cuhna , rhythm guitarist Brandon Lynn , bassist Aaron Boehler and drummer Dillon Ray .
Their second album , Up From The Ashes , was the group 's first effort written and recorded as a band , as their self-titled debut set was all written by frontman James Hart himself with outside writers , and recorded by the singer with session musicians .
It was released on June 28 , 2011 , through Rawkhead Records .
Hart explained the song 's meaning to AntiMusic : `` Lyrically , the song is about breaking free from the expectations and standards that can hold a person back from becoming their true selves and reaching their full potential .
We waste too much precious time trying to work our way up the social or industrial ladder that we lose sight of who we really are . ''
This is the lead single , which was released on iTunes on April 19 , 2011 .
Hart told the story of the song in an interview with AntiMusic : '' ` Tear It Down ' was one of the last songs that was brought to the table when we were finishing writing the album .
Aaron had been working on it in Tulsa , OK with Brandon and Dillon .
On the first day of our pre-production sessions they played the song for Roxx and me and we were immediately blown away .
I knew this had the impact , energy and aggression we were looking for in a first track on the album .
The intro to the song had been around for quite a while .
It was a piece that Brandon had for a song he 'd written that just was n't as far along as the other songs .
We scrapped the song along with quite a few more , but I was in love with the intro bit .
We had talked about trying to work it into a song and onto the album and it just so happened to work with ` Tear It Down . '
I feel it gives the drama and anticipation you look for when kicking off an album . ''
