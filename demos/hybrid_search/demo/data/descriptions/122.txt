This song about a couple standing by each other through rough times as well as the good times was penned by producer Simon Climie and Dennis Morgan .
The duo previously wrote Aretha Franklin and George Michael 's hit '' I Knew You Were Waiting -LRB- For Me -RRB- . ''
The song 's music video is set in winter-time Chicago .
Hicks told Birmingham News : `` I wanted to create that alone , James Dean feel , and get across my point of what true love is .
There 's a couple with something to overcome , an obstacle .
But when you know it 's real , what happens with one person happens with another .
It also brings out the idea that there might be a little bit of longing for true love in me .
I know true , real love is out there . ''
Hicks commented to the Birmingham News : `` Soul Song 101 .
The saxophone subtone in the solo is kind of like a little music lesson .
You can really hear the instrument breathe . ''
