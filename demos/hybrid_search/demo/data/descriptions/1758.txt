Allegedly , Bruce Springsteen was a major influence on Green Day frontman and chief songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong 's writing during the making of 21st Century Breakdown .
Armstrong touched on the Boss ' influence when he explained this song to Q magazine May 2009 .
He said : `` I love old punk flyers .
You 'd see things like a crucifixion of Mickey Mouse : two things that are n't supposed to go together .
That 's kind of what the song is about .
The music is almost Springsteenish . ''
