Not to be confused with at least two other songs of the same name , this uptempo electric folk/country type track runs to 3 minutes 45 seconds , and was inspired by the divorce of her parents when she was sixteen.Mary Chapin Carpenter was born at Princeton , New Jersey in 1958 , and but for the domestic discord , appears to have had a fairly privileged upper middle class upbringing .
Her father was at least partly responsible for her embarking on a musical career .
`` House Of Cards '' was released as a single , performing creditably in both the US and Canadian Country charts .
