This is sometimes titled `` I Told You Twice -LRB- Leftovers -RRB- . ''
This song was inspired by a short story , In The Heart of the Heart of the Country , by the American author William H. Gass .
Cocker explained to The London Times May 16 , 2009 : `` I 'd never read that writer before , but it seemed to be autobiographical , about this middle-aged guy in this backwoods town who 's mourning the breakdown of a relationship .
And there was one phrase that stuck in me mind .
He was describing his mixture of disgust and surprise at the fact that he still had desire left .
He likened it to still having some sweets in the bottom of the paper bag the day after Hallowe'en . ''
Cocker added that he knew the feeling .
`` In some ways I wish I was out of that .
I wish I could retire from the -LRB- sexual -RRB- game ... .
And just be a neutral , reasonably friendly person .
'cause it takes you to problematic places .
But then I realised that wish was kind of ridiculous .
So there is an anger to it in a way .
There 's one part of me wants things to be a bit flat and under control . ''
Cocker explained to The Independent May 9 , 2009 , that the song concerns a forty-something man who `` had anticipated that he would by now have grown out of sexual desire in favour of simply giving out sweets to small children , but instead the leftovers of desire continue to plague him . ''
