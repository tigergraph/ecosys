The first single from British Boy Band JLS ' third album features American alternative artist , Dev , who also provided the female vocals on the Far East Movement 's hit single , `` Like a G6 . ''
The floor-filler was serviced to radio stations on May 25 , 2011 and was debuted by the band at the Capital Summertime Ball on June 12 .
It was released for digital download on July 24 , 2011 .
The JLS boys explained why they hooked up with Dev during an interview with MTV UK .
Said JB : `` We wanted to have a female feature on one of our singles , as we just collaborated with Tinie Tempah , and we thought it was right that we have a female feature.We 're huge fans of her stuff , ` Like A G6 ' is a massive hit around the world , and her solo stuff - like ` Bass Down Low ' and her new song , ` In The Dark ' is wicked .
We think she 's going to be massive , so she was like the perfect choice for us really .
`` Marvin added : `` It 's was the first time she worked with a UK act and the first time we worked with a US act actually .
The vibe was just right , it was the perfect song for us to team up together on . ''
The song was co-written and produced by Moe Faisal and RedOne , after the group bid # 30,000 for a recording session with the frequent Lady Gaga collaborator at Alicia Keys ' Black Charity Ball in 2010 .
