This song finds frontman Adam Gontier harking back to a difficult time in his life when he was penning Three Days Grace 's One-X album .
The vocalist was forced into rehabilitation after becoming addicted to the painkiller , OxyContin .
He told Artist Direct : `` When we did One-X was a dark period in my life .
For me when we play that song , ` Happiness ' is a reminder of where I was at one point in my life and where I do n't want to be again .
It comes from that .
I always have to remember where I was and where I do n't want to be again . ''
