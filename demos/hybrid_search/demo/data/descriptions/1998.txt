This is a track from British Pop group Take That 's first EP Progressed .
It actually is two songs stitched together .
Gary Barlow already had the verse and chorus and Mark Owen came up with the spoken word part .
Barlow said on his website : `` It was a lot of fun to make this track and continues our theme of evolution and the question it evokes . ''
A snippet of this song was played in the intro music before Take That entered the stage on their Progress Live tour .
