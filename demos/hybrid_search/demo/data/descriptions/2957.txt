The lyrics indicate that STP stands for `` Secret Tweaker Pad . ''
A tweaker is someone under the influence of methamphetamines .
On the live Stand By Your Van album , Bradley Nowell adds the word `` speed '' to the end of the line , `` I 'm even learning how to cook . ''
-LRB- thanks , Conrad - Austin , TX -RRB- The lyrics at the end of the song are from `` I Second That Emotion '' by Smokey Robinson : `` Baby you wan na give me kisses sweet , only for a night with no repeat .
Baby you wan na leave and never go , but the taste of honey is worse than none at all . ''
