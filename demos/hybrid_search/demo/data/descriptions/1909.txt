This somber late-night lounge ballad finds Cohen reflecting on his bad behavior to an ex-lover .
He croons : `` Dreamed about you , baby / You were wearing half your dress / I know you have to hate me / But could you hate me less ? ''
Cohen co-wrote the song with the American songwriter-producer Patrick Leonard , who is best known for co-penning many of Madonna 's late '80s .
The Canadian poet-singer met Patrick Leonard through his son Adam , whose album he produced .
He told Mojo magazine : `` I know the work he did with Madonna .
I think he 's a seminal figure in modern American music , very brilliant .
I was listening to some of his solo piano work , too .
I bumped into him with Adam several times , and somehow we got together and these four songs we did together came very quickly , ` Going Home , ' ` Show Me The Place ' ` Anyhow ' and ` Come Healing . ' ''
