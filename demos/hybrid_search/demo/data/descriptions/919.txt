This song is a homage to singer Jeff Buckley .
In a Rolling Stone interview , Legend said : `` I had this really interesting whispering vibrato .
It sounded so intimate and spiritual and ethereal , and it reminded me of Jeff a bit .
I think I can sing with just about anybody , but he 's one of the few singers who truly intimidates me .
He 's one of the best I 've ever heard . ''
