This previously unreleased somber ballad is from Songbook , a solo acoustic album recorded live by Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell .
On the record you hear him explaining to the audience , before playing the song , `` It 's about a guy who loses the love of his life and decides to maybe take himself out .
Or at least he 's thinking about it .
He 's writing a song is what he 's doing . ''
The song is based on the concept of a running joke that Cornell used to have with a friend of his when he used to work at a restaurant .
He explained to Spinner : `` It 's a joke about when somebody was feeling suicidal and went home and sort of pretended they 're cleaning their gun and blow their head off .
It was a metaphor for somebody who was in a bad way or a bad mood or feeling depressed .
I remembered that and felt it would be an interesting approach to writing a lament like that - somebody who was down and out , and in that mood without necessarily using those words , without spelling it out . ''
