This is one of ten tracks pulled from the Rolling Stones ' archives and released by the band on the 2010 update of their 1972 album , Exile on Main St. .
Keith Richards told The Sunday Times May 9 , 2010 that listening to this 38 years later he realised it was the precursor of what became Exile 's big hit single .
`` Suddenly , I realised it was Tumbling Dice , '' Richards said .
`` Some songs , you have the basics , but it 's not really formed yet .
You just wait for that day where suddenly it 's like it 's been there for ever . ''
