This song is about dissidents of the Soviet Union and their fate .
-LRB- thanks , Sarah - Canada -RRB- In the UK , this was not released as a single in its own right , but was the B-side of `` Head Over Heels , '' which peaked at # 25 on the UK charts , ABBA 's lowest chart placing since 1975 - starting the decline of the group 's popularity .
-LRB- thanks , Martin - London , United Kingdom -RRB-
