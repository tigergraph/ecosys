Copperhead Road is a real road in East Tennessee where moonshine was made and two generations later , marijuana was grown .
The song tells the story of a soldier who returns home from Vietnam and starts trafficking marijuana .
Copperhead Road is a highly-acclaimed album that came after an interesting year for Earle : he spent New Year 's Day of 1988 in a Dallas jail charged with assaulting a policeman , had to deal with various legal and business issues , and at one point had a message on his answering machine that said , `` This is Steve .
I 'm probably out shooting heroin , chasing thirteen-year-olds and beatin ' up cops .
But I 'm old and I tire easily , so leave a message and I 'll get back to you . ''
He also married his fifth wife around the time the album was released .
