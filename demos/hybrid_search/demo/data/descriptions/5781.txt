Black Label Society frontman Zakk Wylde wrote this song after the September 11 attacks on America .
The `` doomsday Jesus '' refers to the vengeful God depicted in the Old Testament .
Wylde felt that forgiveness was not the answer , and that the attackers were due retribution .
`` It 's about kill or be killed , '' he told Total Guitar .
`` After a while you get smacked around for so f -- king long , which is what these other c -- ksuckers have been doing to America , it 's like that 's enough .
We 're putting the hammer down .
That 's what ` Doomsday Jesus ' is about . ''
