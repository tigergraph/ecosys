The song 's title refers to a US hospital that involuntarily sterilized 4,000 patients deemed `` unfit '' to reproduce between 1920 and 1972 .
Manics lyricist and guitarist Richey Edwards was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Cardiff and , later , to the Priory in London for treatment having shown signs of emotional instability for several years .
The therapy he received appeared to have helped him .
However in February 1995 , Edwards disappeared , leaving a folder containing various lyrics including the words of this song , which targets an institutional approach to care .
Frontman James Dean Bradfield discussed the track with the NME May 16 , 2009 : `` You get the overall cynicism of treatment trying to subjugate the intelligence of the patient .
Somebody saying , ` There 's not one thing you 've told me that is gon na make me better . '
You get the overall cynicism of someone saying , ` Just get the f -- k out of my room and let me try and solve these problems myself . '
And it is heavily laced with sarcasm .
I also feel it 's Richey doing a bit of research here and integrating the story of the Virginia State Epileptic Colony into his own experience . ''
