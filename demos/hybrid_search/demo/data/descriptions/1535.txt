The title track of Dead Set on Living tells of a friend of vocalist Liam Cormier , who found himself in hospital with the realization that if he did n't change up his life he was going to die .
The experience of his buddy affected Cormier and influenced his writing for the album .
He explained to Terrorizer magazine : '' ` The Void ' is a reaction to the whole D.S.O.L thing , it 's like when bad events happen , it 's easy to get sucked into just looking at yourself and looking at the negative side of things and being consumed with that and where that 's your only thought .
So that 's kinda why I put that next to 'D .
S.O.L ' as well , because those two songs kinda play into each other . ''
