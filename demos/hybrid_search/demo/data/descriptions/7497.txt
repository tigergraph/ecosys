Toby Keith -LRB- from a press release -RRB- : `` The part I love most about this is where he says , ` You can do better than me , maybe . '
He 's telling her all these things he 's done wrong .
Then this line pops up in the song that says I know I messed all this up and I know you can do better than me .
But he ca n't just leave it there .
He 's got ta say , ` Maybe . '
You might could , but it 's too late .
We 'll never know , you already love me .
Deal with it . ''
