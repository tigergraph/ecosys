This was the last song Audioslave wrote before they broke up in 2007 .
Revelations was originally complete with 11 songs , but producer Brendan O'Brien insisted he wanted a big , loud closer for the album .
The next day , the band came up with `` Moth . ''
The last lyrics Chris Cornell ever sang for Audioslave were , `` I wo n't fly around your fire anymore , '' before he left the band to pursue his solo career .
