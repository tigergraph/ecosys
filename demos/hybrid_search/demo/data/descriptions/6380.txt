Lead singer Raine Maida started writing this by thinking about a woman who lived alone in her apartment .
She had little going on in her life , and the apartment was dingy , without much of a view .
She had boxes from her childhood , and one day she took out a pop-up book and opened it to a garden with pop-up flowers .
Whenever she wanted to cheer herself up , she opened the book .
He did n't put the entire history in the lyrics , just traces of it - `` Crying , crying/She could n't afford the view/Crying , crying/These automatic flowers wo n't do . ''
