The most un-Mastodon track on The Hunter , this song features a Moog intro , punctuated with maniacal laughter before morphing into a bass refrain with multi-layered chanted vocals added to the mix .
Drummer/vocalist Brann Dailor told Kerrang !
: `` When we played it to Brent -LRB- Hinds , vocals/guitar -RRB- , we were nervous he would n't like it .
But he got goosebumps .
He just said , ' I f -- ing love it . '
It 's weird song . ''
Dailor said to Rolling Stone of this catchy , Hard Rock tune : `` We never had a real sing-along kind of song before .
When I wrote it , in my head , I remember driving around thinking about that . ''
This song marked the first time that Brann Dailor composed and sung a Mastodon song in its entirety .
