Frontman Win Butler told The A.V. Club why he chose the title ` Neon Bible ' for the album : `` I just jotted it down in my notebook and kept coming back to it .
The song was very much off-the-cuff , written in one night and recorded the next day .
Lyrically , there 's a lot of stuff dealing with religion and culture , which I 'm really interested in .
It 's an image that I kept coming back to that really felt like it was the title of the record .
And everyone else in the band agreed . ''
