This is a track from Mid Air , the debut solo album by The Blue Nile frontman Paul Buchanan .
Speaking with Spinner , he explained the background to the song .
`` Weddings can be like Christmas or Thanksgiving : It all comes to the surface - emotion , family , love , memories , hopes and long held hurts .
This was in my mind , started by a sign I saw in a local hotel : Wedding Party - one sign for all these couples starting out .
All of this , and the memory of leaving a wedding one night , helping an old man to his taxi .
` The band were good , ' he said .
Except there had been no band , only a disc jockey spinning records .
Of such frailty and happiness 's are we made . ''
