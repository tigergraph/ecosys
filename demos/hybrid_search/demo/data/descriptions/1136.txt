This is a parody of David Bowie 's song , `` Breaking Glass . ''
Lowe had previously poked fun at Bowie in 1977 , when he released an EP titled Bowi , in humorous response to Bowie releasing an album titled Low , which lacked the final ` e ' of Lowe 's surname .
Lowe told KLRU that he no longer feels comfortable performing this song live : `` If I played it with just an acoustic guitar , I think the audience would give it a clap , but after about a minute , they would start looking around and waiting for the next tune . ''
This was the first ever single to be released by Radar Records , a UK label formed by the entrepreneurs , Martin Davis and Andrew Lauder .
The single was lifted from Lowe 's debut solo album , Jesus of Cool , which was also the first album to be released by Radar Records .
So to not offend Christians , Jesus of Cool was renamed Pure Pop for Now People in the US .
Steve Goulding , Andy Bodnar and Bob Andrews -- Lowe 's session musicians -- helped to compose this song .
Lowe told The A.V. Club : `` That was a song which was sort of made up in the studio .
I had the vague idea of the tune , and that 's why in the writing credits , I cut the bass player and the drummer in on the song , because they made it , really .
The drums and bass are really great on that song .
Steve Goulding and Andy Bodnar used to play with Graham Parker And The Rumour , whose records I produced , and they played bass and drums on ' -LRB- I Love the Sound of -RRB- Breaking Glass . '
Their contribution was so great , I gave them a third each .
In fact , I should have actually given Bob Andrews , who played piano on it , a taste of the record .
The piano is so great . ''
This was Lowe 's highest charting hit in the UK , where it peaked at # 7 .
