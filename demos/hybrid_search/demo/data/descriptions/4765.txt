Wainwright told the Sun newspaper why she named the album after a line from this song : `` I thought it was funny .
I write phrases like that which are almost nonsensical or a bit off the wall .
I find it provocative .
I was very nervous about naming the album .
I do n't even like naming songs until I absolutely have to .
I call everything ` the something ' song .
Bleeding All Over was obviously going to be the title track and I thought it was really obvious and really menstrual .
It 's clear my music and my person is bleeding all over people so I just wanted to give them a break .
I did n't want it to be me on the cover with my wrists split open .
They were pressurizing me to come with a title and I kept coming back to I Know You 're Married But I 've Got Feelings Too .
So I thought , ` F -- k it , we 'll go with it . ' ''
Wainwright told Uncutmagazine February 2008 about the album : `` It 's less singer-songwriter .
Martha Wainwright was all navel-gazing songs about me and my family .
The new songs are more demented , and more concerned for other people . ''
