`` Sally '' is an inflatable sex doll .
This is made clear by a short poem written and recited by Andy Summers during the middle section of the song .
The rest of the track was based on an unfinished Sting piece .
A song like this is an example of one that would get selective radio play when it came out , but would n't be considered for air on most commercial radio stations these days .
In the book MTV Ruled the World - The Early Years of Music Video , Police drummer Stewart Copeland says that the early - '80s music business felt like a `` mom-n-pop '' operation compared to modern big-business juggernauts : `` With each radio station , the chain of command would go up to the owner of that station in that city , and it would n't go any further than that .
The MD -LRB- music director -RRB- and the owner of the station - they were right there in your face .
Nowadays , the record company A&M is owned by Universal , which is owned by Seagrams , which is owned by Halliburton , which is owned by the dark planet .
And there is no upper echelon that you could even get to .
It 's sort of like it disappears into the haze , the hierarchy .
Directives come down , and it 's difficult to make requests that go up , to get permits , licenses , or decisions . ''
This was an early example of the band 's twisted sense of humor , which would resurface in later Police songs such as `` On Any Other Day '' , `` Bombs Away '' and `` Murder By Numbers . ''
