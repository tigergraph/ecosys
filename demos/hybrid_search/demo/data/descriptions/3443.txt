Stevie Nicks recorded In Your Dreams with producer Dave Stewart -LRB- along with Glen Ballard -RRB- at a house she owns in Los Angeles .
This was one of several tracks that Nicks pulled out of her song vault for the record .
She explained to The Ventura County Star : `` We have a song I wrote when I was 17 that is the words to an Edgar Allan Poem called ` Annabel Lee . '
It 's just lived in my head since I was 17 .
I did n't record it about until 10 years ago .
We found the demo and I 'm not sure why I did n't put it in Trouble in Shangri-la , but I guess things got misplaced.Dave and Glen loved it , so we recorded it .
It 's all my song except they wrote this 30-second English minuet thing that goes in the middle that is very Annabel Lee-esque .
It 's fantastic .
That was a good song without Dave , but with Dave and my musical director and lead guitarist Waddy Wachtel , between all of them they wrote this amazingly beautiful little piece of music .
It just enhanced the song .
I only know four chords so I could never write that .
I took a month of guitar lessons when I was 15 .
I play with one note .
I play well enough to write , but I do n't play enough to really play . ''
The song is an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe 's 1839 poem of everlasting love beyond the grave .
Other tracks inspired by the same work include Black Rebel Motorcycle Club 's `` Annabel Lee '' and Alesana 's `` The Thespian . ''
Nicks recalled to The Ventura County Star penning the song as a teenager : `` I remember sitting on my bed , in my mom and dad 's house , writing that song and being so overwhelmed with the romanticism of it . ''
