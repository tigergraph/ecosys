The single version of this song was remixed by Steve Fitzmaurice and is not the same as the album release .
In the video for this song , Ian Brown pays tribute to his own childhood hero Bruce Lee .
Ex Sex Pistols Steve Jones and Paul Cook and a 32-piece orchestra provide backing on this song .
The former Stone Roses vocalist Brown told Uncut magazine that The World Is Yours was the most ambitious and political album he 'd made so far : `` I tried to make something that was beautiful and at the same time says the thoughts that are on everybody 's mind : poverty , the Iraq war , street kids , the power of the churches , all the things that were wrong with the world .
But I tried to make it beautiful at the same time . ''
