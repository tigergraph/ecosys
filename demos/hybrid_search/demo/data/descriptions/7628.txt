Black Country Communion is an Anglo/American rock supergroup featuring vocalist/bassist Glenn Hughes -LRB- Deep Purple , Black Sabbath , Trapeze -RRB- , drummer Jason Bonham -LRB- Led Zeppelin -RRB- , keyboardist Derek Sherinian -LRB- Dream Theater -RRB- and blues rock guitarist Joe Bonamassa .
Though Hughes acts as elder statesman , all four band members are very strong minded individuals .
Hughes told Nightwatcher 's House of Rock regarding the recording of this song : `` I wrote that in half the time that you hear it .
At the end of the session Jason just started playing , picked up the groove , and moved it 40 bps higher than what I had it .
I was infuriated at first .
I was like , ` How can you do that ? '
But when you listen to the way he plays it , it 's like , ` Okay you 've got a point . '
This is a band where we challenge each other .
It 's not all tea and biscuits .
We 're four fiery people .
So that also shows . ''
