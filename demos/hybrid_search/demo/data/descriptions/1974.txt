This track contains lyrics borrowed from the Irish folk song `` The Men Behind The Wire . ''
The protest tune , which was originally written by Paddy McGuigan , is associated with extreme republican movements such as the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA and was once banned by the BBC .
The lyrics in question include : `` Armored cars and tanks and guns / Came to take away our sons / But every man must stand behind / The men behind the wire . ''
Gregory Campbell , a member of the Democratic Unionist party and MP for East Londonderry in Northern Ireland , criticized Dido , who is of Irish descent .
He declared to The Daily Mail : `` Given her Irish roots , it is inconceivable that she does n't know the background of the wording .
She must know it was written about people who were murderers , arsonists and terrorists .
She should clarify her position so that her fans and the wider public knows where she stands on these things . ''
