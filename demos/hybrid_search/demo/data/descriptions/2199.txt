This track features production from Francis & the Lights frontman Francis Farewell Starlite , whose New York City based band opened up for Drake on his Campus Consciousness/Away From Home college tour .
After he signed on to tour with Drake , Starlite was asked by the Young Money MC 's people if he had any music available .
The New Yorker told MTV News that he struggled to come up with a suitable number , before deciding to give up a track he was saving for himself .
Said Starlite : `` My immediate reaction was to go into the studio with -LSB- my producer -RSB- , who I work with on most of my things , and we tried to make beats .
And we sent one and heard nothing ; we sent another and heard nothing .
And I sort of realized : It has to be deeper than that .
-LSB- For -RSB- Drake and his people , it has to be good above all , before it 's any genre or anything .
So I had a song that I had been working on for a while that I knew was good .
I knew it was something special .
And I made the decision to give it to him and let it go in that way .
So I tracked -LSB- ` Karaoke ' -RSB- in one night in the middle of -LSB- recording -RSB- my record .
I sent it to them , and I heard back in , like , three minutes , '' he laughed .
Starlite added that Drake did n't alter the music much , but admitted the Canadian star 's vocals enhanced the song .
`` He made it better , unquestionably , from what I had , '' the singer said .
`` And that 's a good feeling .
He made it very personal , but making some very subtle changes and doing his thing on it , obviously , with the verses .
He actually made it make sense in a way that did n't make sense to me before . ''
At a listening party held at MSR studios , Drake explained the song is a true story about a girl he grew up with and has been in love with since he was 11-years-old .
However , the lady in question is not interested in being with him , as she does n't like the spotlight .
`` That always cut away at me , '' he said .
