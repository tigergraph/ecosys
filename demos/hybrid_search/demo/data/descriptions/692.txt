This is the first single from Texan rock band Los Lonely Boys ' fourth studio album .
Bassist JoJo Garza explained the song 's meaning to AOL Music : `` The song is about love .
It 's about inspiration from the one you love for the one you love .
It 's about having the will to fall deeper in love with that person whoever she or he may be , going beyond the distance for that love .
The inspiration for myself was the woman I 'm with ... I 'm sure it was the same for my brothers and their wives , but the general inspiration is love itself and about those who know love - real love . ''
The music video was filmed in Austin at the Continental Club .
JoJo Garza told AOL Music : `` The concept based around this one is Los Lonely Boys going back to the roots and playing music on a street corner where people are gathering around to watch as we sing and play our hearts out , to spread love as well as our music and at the same time we make a few tips in the guitar case tip jar .
It 's pretty cool . ''
