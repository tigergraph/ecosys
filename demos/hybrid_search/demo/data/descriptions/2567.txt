Like Rascal 's 2008 UK # 1 single , `` Dance Wiv Me , '' this is a collaboration with electro producer Calvin Harris .
Dizzee told the NME June 13 , 2009 : `` it 's some knight in shining armour s -- t. It 's got some trance sounds , but the tempo is quite slow-its danceable , though it 's got a really summery feel . ''
Harris added : `` I do n't sing on it , which is a bonus for everyone I think - I 'm just producing it , and I wrote the music . ''
Rascal told The Sun August 28 , 2009 about the song 's music video , which shows Dizzee partying in Ibiza surrounded by bikined beauties and 1990s drum 'n' bass star Goldie .
He said : `` I was looking for a Boogie Nights feel .
`` Dizzee is clad in an Oswald Boateng white suit : `` I had to look around for that one but I had my little discount because I 'd seen him -LRB- Boateng -RRB- that week backstage at a Lenny Kravitz concert .
He was cool . ''
R&B vocalist Chrome , who also performed vocals on `` Dance Wiv Me , '' sings the hook on this song .
Harris originally penned this song for British five-piece girl group The Saturdays .
He told The Independent on Sunday August 2 , 2009 `` But they did n't like it .
Or their A&R guy did n't like it .
But Dizzee liked it .
It happens . ''
Tongue N ' Cheek marked Dizzee Rascal 's move away from his Grime roots , in favour of more mainstream Pop music .
He explained to The Daily Telegraph August 10 , 2009 : '' ' I live in a country house in Kent now , big pond , big fish , big whatever , and when I first moved in , I had a little pool party kind of thing .
Where I lived before I did n't really invite anyone round , but this time there were about 20 people there , and I suddenly realised that what I needed to do was make an album you could play all the way through without spoiling the party . ''
