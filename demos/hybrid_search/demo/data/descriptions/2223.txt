Frankie & The Heartstrings are a five-piece rock band from Sunderland in the Northeast of England .
This was their debut single , which was released at the beginning of 2010 .
Frontman Frankie Francis told NME : `` I do feel more creative when I 'm not happy .
Like in the Knut Hamsun book Hunger , he was never more creative or ambitious than when he was living on the streets with not a penny to his name .
It 's about making positives out of extreme adversity . ''
The song title and lyrics pay homage to the Norwegian author Knut Hamsun 's 1890 semiautobiographical novel Hunger , which describes a young writer 's descent into near madness as a result of famine , poverty and homelessness .
