Though Jackson penned this break-up song himself , he maintained to Reuters that 's he 's never personally had to look at a girl in the eye and lie .
`` I do n't know where that line came from , '' said the Georgia singer-songwriter .
`` I keep these pieces of paper around so that whenever I hear something or think of an idea for a song I can write it down .
That line had been on my list since my last album , and I just pulled it out and wrote it . ''
