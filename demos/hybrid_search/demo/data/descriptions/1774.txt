This is the first single from Butterfly House , the fifth full-length studio album by English indie rock band The Coral .
The music video was shot with a '70s California-style vibe showcasing an astronaut on a mission .
The three-day shoot took place in Almeria , Spain , known as the `` Spanish Hollywood '' because of the spaghetti westerns shot there .
It was directed by James Slater and was inspired by the films El Topo and Lucifer Rising .
`` He filmed it all on an old Super 8 camera .
You have to send all the film off to America to get developed , '' explained frontman James Skelly to the NME .
