This ethereal electronic track closes Evanesence 's third album and completes a trilogy of sea-themed songs following `` Never Go Back '' and `` Oceans . ''
Frontwoman Amy Lee explained its meaning to Kerrang !
magazine : `` It 's goodbye , '' she said .
`` It 's partly about the acceptance of death .
I love that song because it 's not angry and it 's not perfectly happy .
It 's sad but it 's accepting the things in life that are hard - like someone leaving this world and feeling the peace of crossing over .
`` She continued : `` I 've been through plenty of loss in my life .
A big part of my early childhood was loss and understanding death and I think that this is me expressing that in a beautiful way .
That 's a part of life and it 's okay . ''
