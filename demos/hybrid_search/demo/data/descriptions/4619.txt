This Ryan Tedder-penned song is the title track of Westlife 's tenth studio album .
Shane Filan of Westlife discussed this song in publicity materials : `` It 's an amazing song , it was the first song he -LRB- Ryan Tedder -RRB- played to us when we went to a studio .
Again we wanted to work with him for a long time .
He 's done a lot of great songs in the last few years this is a very uplifting song , it 's great and kinda in a way the title track of the album kinda represents where we are as a band .
It just made sense to call the album that and the song itself as well , kinda you can feel that in the song .
You know , ` Where we are is where we 're supposed to be ' it feels like we could 've wrote it , you know .
It 's got bit to it , it 's uptempo , it 's uplifting and I think it will be a fans ' favourite on the album . ''
