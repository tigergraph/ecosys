Gallows Frontman Frank Carter -LRB- From Kerrang !
April 18 , 2009 -RRB- : `` The lyrics at the beginning of the album were pretty condemning and suggest there is nothing left , whereas this point - the beginning of the second half - is a bit more positive , in the most negative way .
The words are very family orientated and are about us as brothers in the band .
When the end comes , I know I wo n't be alone .
I know I will never be as lonely as I have been .
I have overcome a few things in the past year and I know I will never feel as alone as I did then . ''
