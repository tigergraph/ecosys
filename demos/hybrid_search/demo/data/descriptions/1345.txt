The third single from Gloria Estefan 's eleventh studio album features a mixture of Spanish and English lyrics and also combines modern dance music with a 1920s and 30s swing sound .
Estefan told Billboard magazine : `` We wanted a very woody , old fashioned sound , cause its jitterbuggy this song .
It 's got clarinets , it 's got saxes , and a whole different vibe - it just sounds like you could be in the 20s but with hardcore dance . ''
