Flo Rida 's second single from his Wild Ones features vocals from Sia Furler .
The Australian singer songwriter 's single , `` Taken for Granted '' was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom in 2000 and a few years later her composition `` Breathe Me '' was used at the end of the last episode of the TV show Six Feet Under .
The song was co-produced by the French team soFLY and Nius along with Axwell , who is a member of Swedish House Mafia .
Sia has also collaborated and performed with Christina Aguilera and David Guetta amongst others .
In fact both the Aussie songstress -LRB- `` Titanium '' -RRB- and Flo Rida -LRB- `` Where Them Girls At '' -RRB- appeared on Guetta 's Nothing But The Beat album .
Sia penned the song in 15 minutes but then had to be persuaded to record the vocal as she 'd been intending to concentrate on songwriting .
`` They asked me to record -LSB- `` Wild Ones '' -RSB- over and over for almost six months , '' she told Billboard magazine .
`` Eventually I said , ` OK , but do n't put my name on it . ' ''
However , Sia was credited as a featured artist , which made her exchange cross words with her manager Jonathan Daniel .
`` I was angry because we had already had this discussion , '' said Sia .
`` Jonathan said to me , ' I do n't think I really believed you that you did n't want to be credited or get the recognition you deserve . ' ''
