This song features Regina Spektor .
Ben Folds told Rolling Stone magazine about their collaboration .
He explained : `` It 's real simple I just called her up and we went up and did it .
I had a part I wanted her to sing it , but she added a lot .
There 's stuff that just came out of her mouth that was n't the plan , which is great .
That 's kinda what I wanted .
The song chords were so simple there was n't much room for that , but she 's one of those talented people .
When she works it 's scary good .
She 's just all talent . ''
