Carpenter based this song on a true story .
In the early hours of October 11 , 1945 , a scantily dressed black youth was found by 2 police officers rummaging in an alleyway in Jacksonville , Illinois .
He was believed to be mentally retarded , and because of his bizarre behavior he was committed to an institution later that month where he became known as John Doe No. 2 .
John Doe -LRB- or Jane Doe -RRB- is the generic name given to unidentified bodies , including , apparently , live ones .
In spite of attempts to trace his family , John Doe No. 2 - later John Doe No. 24 - was never positively identified , and he would spend the rest of his life being cared for by the state .
In 1976 , his name was changed for social security reasons to John Doe Boyd -LRB- date of birth unknown -RRB- .
He died November 28 , 1993 .
Carpenter read his obituary in the New York Times while sitting in a Starbucks caf√© in Washington , and wrote the song from his perspective .
In 2000 , a biography of John Doe by Dave Bakke was published by Southern Illinois University Press ; it was called God Knows His Name : The True Story Of John Doe No. 24 ; Carpenter wrote the foreword and also purchased the headstone for his grave , a photograph of which appears between pages 92 and 93 of the book .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander - London , England , for above 2 -RRB-
