It 's pretty fast the way my process is - I do n't over-think ; I do n't sit down and come up with concepts .
Usually the music kinda tells me what to say .
I kinda figure out instantly what I feel like a track is gon na say .
With ` Mr. Wrong , ' I felt like it described myself and my relationships that I have with women .
Same as -LSB- Melanie Fiona 's -RSB- ' 4AM ' -- it 's kinda autobiographical for me .
I 'm just describing what I 've heard women in my life say to me . ''

The songwriter told Rap-Up .
com that he based it on his own chequered lovelife : `` It 's an extremely soulful song that expresses the true level of love that a woman can have for a man who simply is no good for her , '' said Love .
`` I wrote it because in many ways I am Mr. Wrong . ''
