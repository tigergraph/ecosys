Paul Weller : `` This was one of the first songs we recorded .
It 's about the new season coming on .
That feeling of optimism and hope you get as the days get lighter and longer .
The folk guitarist John McCusker plays on it , top man . ''
The closing track `` Night Lights '' ends with this opening song 's introduction .
Weller explained why on his website : `` I wanted to make an album with a beginning , a middle and an end .
That 's why the two songs ` Light Nights ' and ` Night Light 's ' are at the first and last tracks .
It 's designed to be listened to in one sitting , in the same way that Pet Sounds or Sgt Pepper were . ''
