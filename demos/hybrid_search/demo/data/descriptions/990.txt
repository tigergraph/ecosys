Allan penned this Set You Free track with Matt Warren and Hillary Lindsey .
It was written out of the same session that yielded `` Every Storm -LRB- Runs Out of Rain -RRB- . ''
`` We wanted to write an introspective song , '' he recalled to The Boot .
`` I had just lost my dad , and we talked about the people we had lost in our lives .
We kept thinking , ` What would you say when you get to the pearly gates ? '
And that was how the song started .
I said I would want one more time , I 'm not ready to be here .
It 's very therapeutic to write with Hillary and Matt because we kick our emotions around so much . ''
Allan particularly enjoys his collaborations with Warren and Lindsey .
`` Every time I 've written with her and my buddy Matt Warren , we end up with like nine starts of a song , because it seemed like we were always branching off into some other subject , '' he noted .
`` Then we 'd come back and we 'd write one or two of those and have four or five more ideas .
Eventually , we would come back and finish writing one or two more of those .
It 's an amazing thing that we have .
We 've written nine or ten songs , but we 've only been written together three times .
It 's quality .
Once you get those kind of rhythm going , you try to ride it out the best you can . ''
