Devendra Banhart comments in the October 2007 edition of Q Magazine : `` We recorded this on a ship with a really rad Armenian captain and this half-Gypsy , half Hawaiian first mate .
We used a vintage church mic .
There 's only one in all of Los Angeles . ''
The album Smokey Rolls Down Thunder was Banhart 's first album to reach the Billboard 200 chart .
It was recorded in California 's Topanga Canyon , erstwhile home to Neil Young , Gram Parsons and Charles Manson .
Devendra Banhart comments in the same Magazine : `` It was pretty intense .
Everyone at the house suffered shingles and exhaustion .
Because our studio was our house !
In one way , how convenient .
In another way , how difficult .
The only incentive to stop working is blacking out .
And now it 's done and everyone 's in a little bit of shock .
But y' know , it was fun .
The view from my window , man , I could see Neil 's house where he recorded After The Goldrush and Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere .
