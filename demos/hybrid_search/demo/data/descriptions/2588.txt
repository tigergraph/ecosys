Tricky named his debut solo album , Maxinquaye , after his mother , Maxine Quaye , who committed suicide when he was only four years old .
However , the musician states in this song that he does n't believe in death .
Tricky told The Guardian : `` The weird thing with me is I 've had close people die , like my Mum , but I do n't get sad at death .
I miss them , obviously , but move on .
That 's not because I 'm a bad person or emotionally numb , but there must be a reason it do n't affect me .
I think it 's because death does n't really exist .
I do n't believe in it . ''
