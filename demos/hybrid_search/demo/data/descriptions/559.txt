The name Clifton Grange does not appear anywhere in this Phil Lynott composition , and judging by Eric Bell 's showboating , an uninformed person might think the lyrics - such as they are - were incidental , and that it was written purely as a vehicle for a young but talented lead guitarist .
Informed persons know different!The Clifton Grange Hotel in Manchester was run by Lynott 's mother and Dennis Keeley .
In the 1996 authorised biography of Phil and the band , Stuart Baillie says it was known as The Showbiz or simply The Biz , and was on the corner of Wallington Road , Whalley Range .
Its clientelle were exclusively entertainers and showbusiness types including conjurers , strippers , Maori dancers and a transsexual ventriloquist!It was also patronised by George Best -LRB- a drinking pal of Phil who gets a mention in `` Black Rose '' -RRB- , and by `` lots of Manchester United players '' for parties .
`` The Biz '' is mentioned affectionately by Deke Leonard in Rhinos , Winos & Lunatics : The legend of Man a rock 'n' roll band .
Sadly , it was demolished when the area was redeveloped .
