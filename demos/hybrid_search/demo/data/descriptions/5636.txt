Need You Now is bookended with two of its most emotionally naked numbers .
This closing track provides a sort of answer to the album opener , `` Need You Now . ''
Whilst songs like '' ` Something ` Bout a Woman '' and `` When You Got A Good Thing '' were inspired by co-vocalist Charles Kelley 's newly-wedded bliss , other tracks on Need You Now such as this song reveal the other side of the emotional coin .
That 's no accident , Kelley told The Toronto Sun : `` Well , I just got married , so there is a lot of that .
I was definitely feeling in that romantic place .
But people do n't want to hear a whole record about that .
We do n't either .
And at the same time , Hillary was going through a lot of stuff .
That 's where ` Ready to Love Again ' and some of the other songs about having to pick yourself back up came from .
So we ended up with a balanced record . ''
Co-vocalist Hillary Scott told CMT News that that this cut `` is really , really special to me . ''
She explained : `` It 's the one that I relate to the most .
It 's very personal , so we really allowed ourselves to go there and be vulnerable and show the fans that we feel and we hurt and we love just like anybody else does .
I hope they feel that when they hear it . ''
