This is a semi-autobiographical song about Joel 's early career as a musician , knowing that if he did n't continue producing hits , he would soon be forgotten .
It 's a very pragmatic look at the life of a Pop star , covering the unsavory aspects of fame as well as the excitement .
Perhaps it was Joel 's understanding of the trappings of fame that led to a long and successful career in the music industry .
The lyrics , `` If you 're gon na have a hit you got ta make it fit , so they cut it down to 3:05 '' are a reference to his song `` Piano Man , '' which was edited down for airplay .
