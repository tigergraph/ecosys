Gene Simmons : `` The genesis of the song ` Calling Dr. Love ' originally came from ` Bad Bad Lovin ' which had n't made it into the KISS recording repertoire .
Nobody seemed to like it well enough .
So I kept refining it .
Then one day I was watching The Three Stooges and something jumped out at me .
It was a passage where the Three Stooges had snuck into a hospital , donned surgical equipment and made believe they were doctors and kept running back and forth from room to room with a public address system saying ` Calling Dr. Howard , Dr. Fine , Dr. Howard . '
And then I thought of rewriting the chorus idea into ` Calling Dr. Love ' who has a peculiar way of injecting his patients .
By the time KISS had started earning gold and platinum records and filling every arena around the world , Paul and I naturally started kidding each other about our individual writing styles and song titles , both of us taking a turn at each other . ''
