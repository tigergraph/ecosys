This is one of several tracks on Charmer inspired by watching trashy TV shows . ''
` Soon Enough , ' is about an intervention , '' explained Mann .
`` Everybody 's reading their letters and everybody 's crying , while once again , the target of the intervention is like ` F -- k all y' all . '
It 's so classic .
So the narrator of the song is like , ` Yeah , I know , we 're all a bunch of a -- holes -- we 're all against you .
Just sit and listen to the letters , and soon enough you can say what a bunch of jerks we are .
We get it . ' ''
Mann wrote this song with US comic actor/musician Tim Heidecker of Tim & Eric fame , who also directed a video for the tune .
