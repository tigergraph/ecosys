Asking Alexandria is a Post-Hardcore/Metalcore band from the city of York in north England .
They formed in 2007 when rhythm guitarist and synth player Ben Bruce contacted some of his old pals after moving back to England from Dubai .
The line-up for their second album Reckless and Relentless consisted of Bruce , vocalist Danny Worsnop , lead guitarist Cameron Liddell , bass guitarist Sam Bettley and drummer James Cassells .
Worsnop told Artist Direct that there is a lyrical thread that runs throughout the Reckless and Relentless album .
He explained it , `` is all about my drug , sex , and alcohol addictions .
It 's basically a document of stuff that I was going through or had done . ''
Bruce explained the album title to Artist Direct : `` The title is something that we felt summed up the whole album and our two years of touring so far .
It has been ` Reckless and Relentless . '
We have n't stopped touring since before the first album came out .
We went on tour about a month before the first album came out and we have n't stopped since then .
We took a break to go into the studio and had a week off for Christmas and that 's it .
It 's constant touring .
After we named the album , Children of Bodom came out with a record called The Reckless Relentless , and I was like , ` That f -- king sucks ! '
-LSB- Laughs -RSB- We were n't going to change it though because we felt like it was the perfect name for this album , and it tells the story we wanted to tell . ''
