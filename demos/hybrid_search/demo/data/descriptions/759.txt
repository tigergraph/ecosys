Taylor wrote this track for the soundtrack of the movie , The Hunger Games .
The film is set in a damaged post-apocalyptic world where teenagers fight to the death in an event aired annually on live television and this song finds her attempting to hang on as others watch her struggle .
`` Everybody 's waiting for you to break down/Everybody 's watching to see the fallout/Even when you 're sleeping , keep your eyes open , '' she sings of the trials and tribulations that the youngsters portrayed in the film are forced to undergo .
Taylor told Rolling Stone that it was an enjoyable change of pace penning tunes for the fictional character , Katniss Everdeen , rather than writing confessional songs about her own past .
`` Slipping into her mind was such a wonderful break , '' she said .
`` It 's pretty intense writing about my own life , my own struggles .
It was almost like a vacation to get to write from someone else 's perspective . ''
Taylor also contributed a second song to the soundtrack , the collaboration with The Civil Wars titled `` Safe and Sound . ''
