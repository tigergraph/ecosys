This transformative ballad about regaining one 's self is one of six Pioneer tracks co-written with Brian Henningsen , his son Aaron and daughter Clara .
The Heningsens also co-penned several tracks on The Band Perry 's debut album , including the singles `` All Your Life '' and `` You Lie . ''
Kimberly Perry explained to Billboard magazine , what makes their writing partnership work .
`` They 're a family .
We 're a family , '' she said .
`` They grew up in rural Illinois , we grew up in the deep south .
There 's so much sensibility when we sit down to write .
They 're avid readers , as we love to read , so we really get each other on those levels .
It 's cool to take a seemingly complex thought and fit it into a creative bed of music and lyric that resonates universally .
I feel that we have really discovered this really cool art between the six of us . ''
