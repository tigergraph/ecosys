Conor Oberst explained the meaning of this haunting atmospheric ballad to NME : `` It 's the idea of when in the not-so-distant future , artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence and humanity as a notion is just kind of quaint . ''
This is one of a handful of songs that Oberst wrote before sessions for The People 's Key commenced .
He told Billboard magazine the rest of the songs `` were closely related and tied together and more deliberate ... to where I saw -LSB- the album -RSB- was headed . ''
The result weaves together topical , social and political issues , to help tie things together .
`` I do n't think it 's overtly political , '' Oberst explained .
`` There 's a certain desire for common ground between people , just the idea that we 're all kind of in the same boat and are all the same as far as the way human beings go .
There 's this future that 's coming that 's really trying to , I think , divide us more and in a lot of ways strip us of our human nature in the sense that now when you walk into a room it 's like 20 people all staring down at this little screen in their hands , typing away , not looking at each other .
That 's kind of scary , and it 's going to just keep going that way .
I think it 's a dangerous position to put ourselves in because our only chance of solving problems or disagreements is by talking to each other and seeing ourselves in each other . ''
