This was written in 1947 by the Country & Western guitarist and songwriter Merle Travis .
It is based on his coal miner father , whose favorite saying , `` Another day older and deeper in debt , '' became part of the chorus .
At the time , this was the fastest-selling single in the history of Capitol Records - impressive when you consider they had Frank Sinatra on their roster .
Some of the many artists who covered this song include Eddy Arnold , Big Bill Broonzy , Eric Burdon , Johnny Cash , Jimmy Dean , Charlie Daniels , Joe Cocker , The Platters , Leon Russell , Johnnie Taylor and The Weavers .
When Diddley appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1955 , he was asked to play this , but performed his hit Bo Diddley instead , defying the host and getting himself banned from the program .
According to the book 1000 UK # 1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh , Tennessee Ernie Ford was so busy with a 5-day-a-week daytime show that he fell behind with his recording commitments for Capitol Records .
He recalled , `` Capitol told me I 'd be in breach of contract if I did n't record soon , but I was always thumbing through songbooks looking for music .
I liked Merle Travis ' songbook .
He 'd lived in the coal mining community , and my grandfather and my uncle had mined coal .
I showed Sixteen Tons to my conductor as I liked it very much .
Capitol kept telling me to get over there so we went with Sixteen Tons and You Do n't Have To Be A Baby To Cry and we recorded them with a six-piece band .
Lee Gillette -LRB- the producer -RRB- said from the control , `` What tempo do you want it in ? ''
and I snapped my fingers to show him .
He said `` Leave that in , '' and that snapping on Sixteen Tons is me . ''
General Electric used this in a commercial television advertisement campaign .
