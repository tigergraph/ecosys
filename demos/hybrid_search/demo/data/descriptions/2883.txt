This is one of several acoustic tracks on Surfers Paradise , where Cody adopts a surf-and-sun sound not that far removed from beach troubadour Jack Johnson .
`` I grew up playing the acoustic guitar and I decided I really wanted to go back to my roots on this album , '' the singer told Radio.com .
`` I grew up listening to Jack Johnson , Jason Mraz , and John Mayer so they definitely inspired a lot of the album too .
There 's a really mellow , acoustic sound to it . ''
Cody added that this is his favorite track on Surfers Paradise : `` It 's an all-around beautiful record , '' he said of the song .
`` Acoustic guitar , ukulele and vocal and that 's it .
It 's definitely an indicator to how I 'm growing as an artist , how my music and sound is evolving . ''
