Dave ` Avey Tare ' Portner wonders , `` how I even wrote this song , does this not occur to almost everyone ? ''
as he croons about the state of our planet .
Josh `` Deakin '' Dibb told AUX Magazine : `` I was really psyched on the lyrical content of it from Dave 's perspective in terms of liability .
I guess it 's one of the closest things we have to an environmental song .
That 's him struggling with the reality of our environmental footprint .
I get really pysched on that side of it .
It almost reminds me , energy-wise , like what was cool about the JB 's .
And Bob Marley .
Not that I think most people would pick up on any sort of message in that regards , but I think that 's sort of cool , that it kind of feels like that to me when playing it . ''
