This reflective tune about remembering what was great about one 's hometown , years after moving away was penned by Nashville songwriters Luke Laird , Ashley Gorley and Hillary Lindsey .
Underwood first heard the song on her drive back to her hometown of Checotah , Oklaholma , where her parents still live .
Carrie admitted to The Boot that she was n't interested in the song at first glance .
`` I saw the title , ` Thank God For Hometowns ' and I thought -LSB- here is -RSB- another ' I love my truck .
I love my hometown .
I love my mama , ' another one of those .
There are so many great ones about small towns , but there 's just a lot out there .
I was thinking , ` That 's just going to be another static song ' and then I listened to it and just the way it starts , talking to your mom , I was like ` these are all things my mom would say . ' ''
The song 's narrator learns to embrace the comforts of her hometown , years after its discomforts drove her away .
Speaking with NPR 's Guy Ruz , Underwood said the song 's lyrics reflects how she feels about Checotah .
She said : `` That line about thank God for county lines that welcome you back in when you were dying to get out , that was me , you know ?
I 'd sit around - and everyone does this .
There 's always nothing to do in your town , right ?
So when I was younger , I would just think , oh , my gosh , like , there 's a whole world out there and I 'm not seeing it .
I 'm here , you know , I ca n't wait to leave .
And soon as I left , all I wanted to do was go home . ''
