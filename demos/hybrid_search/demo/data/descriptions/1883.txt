Chesney told CMT that this is the most personal song on his album : `` It 's the most brutally honest song on this record about me and about my reality .
That whole song is a letter that I 've written to several girls .
It 's very honest .
It 's a brutally honest song .
It really is .
And they will definitely open up the book a little bit and see inside just a touch . ''
