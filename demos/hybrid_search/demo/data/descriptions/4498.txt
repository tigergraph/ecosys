Cook wrote this piano-driven number with Jess Cates and David Hodge , who also co-penned David Archuleta 's debut single , `` Crush . ''
When Cook won the seventh season of American Idol , Archuleta was the runner-up .
The other co-writer was Lindy Robbins , who also co-penned Demi Lovato 's hit single , `` Here We Go Again '' and Selena Gomez & the Scene 's `` A Year Without Rain . ''
The song finds Cook singing at the beginning , `` When did you lose any sense ?
And when did you find that you ca n't hold on ? ''
By the end he is pleading , `` Just stay with me ! ''
`` We were n't exactly sure how it -LSB- the song -RSB- was going to pan out , '' Cook told Billboard magazine , `` but it became a really important piece to the puzzle really quick . ''
