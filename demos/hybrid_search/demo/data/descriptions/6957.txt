Rizzle Kicks is a British Hip-Hop/Pop duo comprising Jordan `` Rizzle '' and Harley `` Sylvester . ''
They first knew each other in the mid 1990s when they were kids at primary school , but went their own separate ways .
The pair reunited several years later at the BRIT School , which they both attended .
They soon realized how nicely their styles fit together and formed a duo .
Jordan and Harley were signed by Island Records after making a series of videos to accompany their songs .
Jordan explained to The Brighton Source : `` The short story is that YouTube got us a record deal .
We made the song ` Down With The Trumpets ' and put it on our MySpace last February and , well , people liked it but no one really said that much about it .
Then we made a video and people seemed to understand what we 're about more . ''
Even though this song became Rizzle Kicks calling card , the duo admitted to The Sun it was never meant to happen .
Harley explained : `` To be honest , we did n't want to release ` Trumpets . '
It was the second song we ever made .
`` Jordan added : `` I bought the demo beat for # 50 in 2008 and wrote a really simple chorus .
It led to us getting signed and the label were intent on releasing it first .
It was summery and I think that 's why people liked it . ''
This was released as the second single from Rizzle Kicks ' debut album .
Harley told Hollyoaks Music Show the song does n't have any particular meaning , its just a vibe inspired by the mariachi trumpet sample .
`` We got sent the beat and we wrote to that beat , and basically the beat gave off , a summery vibe , '' he explained .
