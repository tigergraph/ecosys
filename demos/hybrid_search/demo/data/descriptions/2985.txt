This is the lead single from KT Tunstall 's fourth studio album Invisible Empire / / Crescent Moon .
Tunstall described the two part set as `` full of songs from the heart . ''
The first batch focuses on the themes of mortality , and the second evokes a more ethereal mood .
Tunstall recorded two versions of this song , a more stripped back , melancholic one with PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish on drumming duty , which can be found on the album .
The second ` band jam ' version , which was recorded live in Tucson , Arizona , was chosen for the radio release .
Tunstall started this song just before the death of her father , and finished it after splitting up with her husband Luke Bullen .
`` It 's probably the most personal song on the album , '' she said .
`` So it was absolutely birthed out of the intensity of those two things happening .
It was real medicine for me , that song . ''
The single was debuted on April 29 , 2013 , on BBC Radio 2 , during the Ken Bruce Show .
The music video was directed by Isaac Ravishankara , who previously worked with The Lumineers and Ellie Goulding , and was shot in Arizona 's Tucson Desert .
