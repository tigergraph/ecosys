This song , which Quatro performed with Chris Norman , the front man for Smokie , was a departure from her Hard Rock sound , as the pair sing about stumbling into love with someone they never expected to be with .
This song turned out to be by far the biggest hit for both performers .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA -RRB- In the US , Quatro is known for her role as Leather Tuscadero on the TV show Happy Days .
She had a string of hits in the UK , but this is her only hit single in the US .
