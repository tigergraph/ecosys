Churchill are an Indie-Folk five-piece from Denver , Colorado comprising Tim Bruns -LRB- guitar/vocals -RRB- , Bethany Kelly -LRB- keyboards/vocals -RRB- , Mike Morter -LRB- mandolin/guitar -RRB- , Tyler Rima -LRB- bass -RRB- and Joe Richmond -LRB- drums -RRB- .
After playing a couple of shows with no name , the band decided to adopt as their moniker a saying they often used .
`` We had this thing when someone did something embarrassing or funny we would say that they `` Churchilled '' it , '' explained Richmond to 303 magazine .
Bruns and Kelly share lead vocals on the track .
Bruns told The ALT Vault it was `` a really good learning process '' for Bethany and him singing together .
He said : `` I have always thought she has the better voice , so when we first started the band there were times when I knew that a song would sound better if Bethany sang it .
` Change ' is a good example of that .
We are still learning to sing together and starting to really understand each others voices and styles . ''
This is the title track and lead single from their Change EP , which was self-recorded and produced by the band and re-released in October 2012 after they signed with the A&M / Octone Records label .
Tim Twinem directed the song 's music video , which features a man named Dennis dancing on rollerskates .
It was the band who suggested the concept to Twinem `` We met Dennis at a show we played in Boulder and what you see in the video is 100 % him , '' explained Richmond to 303 magazine .
He just loves to skate dance and he was doing that at our show and we asked him to be in our video .
We did n't ask him to do anything besides be himself .
We love Dennis . ''
