This song from Canadian Alternative Rock band Evans Blue 's fourth album was debuted on December 9 , 2012 on Revolver 's website .
Vocalist Dan Chandler explained the inspiration behind the track to the magazine : `` The song was written about a moment in my life when I felt things/people were being taken from me without reason .
Something a lot of us have unfortunately had to deal with .
Parker -LSB- Lauzon , guitarist -RSB- sent me the music when I was going through a hard time .
Many questions .
When you lose something important to you , it 's almost like you ca n't stop your mind from revisiting the past .
The song came to me quick because of the mood I had been in .
It was a very medicinal writing for me ... The song is personal and people close to me know me well , so they immediately understood what the song had to say . ''
