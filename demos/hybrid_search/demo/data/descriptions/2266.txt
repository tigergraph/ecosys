This song has just one line repeated over and over : `` My brother and my sister do n't speak to me but I do n't blame them . ''
Blake explained the lyric to Q magazine : `` Well , I 'm an only child .
You could psychologically pick that apart but it was an in-joke .
I did n't resent being an only child , but I saw that other people had brothers and sisters and I always felt slightly sorry for myself that I did n't learn to socialize , -LRB- but -RRB- there 's a contentment with your own company . ''
