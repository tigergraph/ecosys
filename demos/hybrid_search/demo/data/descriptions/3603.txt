Drummer Aaron Gillespie explained this song to Punkbands.com : `` I wrote those lyrics on a plane on my phone .
I think in our band we know what our purpose is here and we know why we 're here but it 's hard to not take advantage of that sometimes and , you know , I 'm in a band and it 's easy sometimes but it 's just a cry to God .
Like , is it too late for you to help us out and help us realize that what we have is special ? ''
