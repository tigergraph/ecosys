This dance-pop tune was released by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue as a single to coincide with the celebration of the singer 's quarter century in the music business .
The song was dropped on May 25 , 2012 , two months short of twenty-five years after her debut single , a cover of Little Eva 's `` The Loco-Motion , '' came out in Australia , Sweden and Italy .
The Christian Larson directed video was shot in London 's Soho area .
We see Kylie striding down Old Compton Street singing aloud .
`` When we were shooting down the busiest street in Soho , I worked with an in-ear monitor , '' she told Vevo .
`` I must have looked like a complete idiot because I 'm strutting down the street singing to absolutely nothing !
`` After Kylie removes her jacket , we see she 's wearing a provocative black mini dress .
She told Vevo : `` That was a very cheeky little outfit .
People do n't believe it , but I do get very shy and timid .
I was like , ` Oh god please , ca n't there be more to this ? ' ''
