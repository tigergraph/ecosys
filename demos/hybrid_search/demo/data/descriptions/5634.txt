This is the lead single from R&B artist Jaheim 's fifth studio album , Another Round .
Jaheim co-wrote this with Balewa Muhammad , Eritza Laues , Marcella Brailsford and Keir Gist -LRB- also known as Kaygee -RRB- , the last of whom produced the song .
The singer told Billboard magazine how the song originated in a club : `` We 'd been holed up in the studio and needed to get some air , '' Jaheim recalled .
`` So we went to a club and this little thing was running across the floor .
And I said , ` Girl , you know what ?
I 'm not leaving here without you . '
From there , the boys put it together . ''
The song borrows from the Whatnauts ' 1982 R&B single , `` Help Is on the Way , '' which was previously sampled by De La Soul for their 1991 single , `` Ring Ring Ring -LRB- Ha Ha Hey -RRB- . ''
