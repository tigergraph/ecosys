Villagers are an Irish band fronted by Conor J. O'Brien .
Their debut album Becoming a Jackal was released in Ireland on 14 May 2010 , topping the charts there .
The following week it came out in the rest of Europe and the United Kingdom and then in North America a fortnight later .
O'Brien told The Sun August 6 , 2010 .
`` Howling is an intensely primal thing .
It is something , which is generally frowned upon in most areas of everyday life .
I see it as somewhat of a coup that I 've managed to put myself in the position whereby I do it almost every day in an intensely public space . ''
On the doo-wop-tinged climax to the album , Conor O'Brien , breaks into howling .
The frontman told Mojo magazine that he penned the song immediately after his first band , The Immediate , disintegrated in 2006 leaving him , `` in pieces , in the corner of the room .
In an endless afternoon . ''
But wanting to rein in the morose mood , he conceived the idea that , `` a touch of theatre can really connect with people .
And howling was such an incredible feeling !
But it was really weird too .
I recorded Pieces at 3am in a loft outhouse , and the very next morning , a pack of dogs appeared , and for the next few nights I was kinda terrified because they were all walking around the house , and I 've never seen them again since . ''
