This was originally a # 15 Country hit for Mel Tillis in 1976 .
It is one of a number of interpretations of other artists ' songs on The Guitar Song album .
Johnson explained to Billboard magazine how he came to choose the covers : `` It can be just all the guys hanging out in the control room , thinkin ' about what we 're fixin ' to go in to play .
Maybe playin ' a couple of songs I wrote and not really catching the vibe or whatever , then turn around and play an old song that seems to fit better with what we just got through playing .
Sometimes our sessions are nothing more than us kicking back and listening to our favorite music that day .
If there 's something that does n't jive with the rest of what we 're playing on that session that day , we get those things out of the way and we come in with the ones that do work .
That 's where you get songs like ` For The Good Times ' or ` Mental Revenge . '
It 's usually gon na be some vibe we 're looking for , or some feeling we 're looking to expand on a little better . ''
