Dave Matthews produced several tracks on Funstyle and also performed on this song .
Phair told Spinner , `` It 's just a mutual admiration that came about a few years ago .
Instantly , we liked each other .
His entire production was an eye-opening experience .
We do n't come from the same culture , but the people that he surrounds himself with , and the kind of person he is , is so inspiring that I defy anybody to get to know him and not love him . ''
