This sex-infused ode finds Rihanna relaying everything she wants her man to do when they get it on .
The flagrantly provocative urban track was produced by Shondrae `` Bangladesh '' Crawford , who is famed for his filthy beats on Lil Wayne 's `` A Milli '' and Ke $ ha 's `` Sleazy . ''
Rihanna recruited rapper A$ AP Rocky for the song 's official remix , which was premiered at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on September 6 , 2012 .
The remixed track was released on iTunes the same day .
Bangladesh told MTV News the song originated a long time before Rihanna recorded it . ''
` Cockiness , ' it 's layers of things I had sampled for a long time , never really messed with it too much , '' he said .
`` I was in L.A. , and I had just pulled it out , chopped it up , made it a beat .
My artist Candice Pillay , my other writers , Dem Jointz , they wrote the song . ''
`` It was n't ` Cockiness ' at first , it was something else , '' he added .
`` They had the ' I love it ' part .
... -LSB- They -RSB- came up with that part first , and that was n't even on that track : It was just an idea .
I was going to make a whole new beat out of it , what they wrote to it that day , it was n't really all the way done .
A couple days later , they revisited it and came up with the ` Cockiness . '
`` Given its sexual innuendo and swagger , there was one person who immediately came to mind to record the track .
`` I was like , ` That 's dope .
That 's Rihanna all day , ' '' Bangladesh said .
`` They sent the song back , and I finished producing it .
I put the ' I love it ' on it that they had already had .
She loved it , and that 's what it was . ''
