Brett Anderson explained in a press release that this , `` is a bittersweet , bouncy pop song with a whole load of choruses stuck together . ''
This was released as the first single from Suede 's sixth album , Bloodsports .
Brett Anderson explained the album title to NME : `` It was supposed to be about the fight and the chase and the struggle of relationships , really .
The initial idea of the album was that it would be ten songs charting the stages of a relationship from meeting someone to it crumbling and splitting up .
There 's a book I really like called Essays in Love by Alain de Botton , which it was inspired by .
But that fell apart a little bit . ''
Regarding the song 's meaning , Anderson said : `` It 's about infatuation and attraction and the fever of falling head first back into the pit . ''
Bassist Mat Osman described the song to Q magazine as , `` like a load of choruses put together . ''
