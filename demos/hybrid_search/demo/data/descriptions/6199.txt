This was the theme tune for the 1980 comic-book movie Flash Gordon .
It captured perfectly the tongue-in-cheek element of the film .
Among the snippets of dialogue that can be heard is the actor Brian Blessed delivering the line , `` Gordon 's alive ! ''
This song was used as the basis for Will Ferrell and Jon Heder 's final routine in the 2007 comedy Blades of Glory .
This was sung as a duet between Freddie Mercury and Brian May with drummer Roger Taylor supplying the high harmonies .
Queen wrote the entire soundtrack to the movie .
Drummer Roger Taylor explained to Mojo magazine October 2008 : `` We wanted to write the first rock 'n' roll soundtrack to a non-music film .
At the time , rock 'n' roll was not used in movies unless they were specifically about music .
`` Brian May added : `` We wanted a soundtrack album that made you feel like you 'd watched the film so we shipped in all the dialogue and effects and wove it together like tapestry . ''
