Jesse Lacey wrote this song after an extended period of excessive touring without rest .
He and his band mates were growing tired of their schedule , and were becoming very home sick .
Lyric Analysis : `` I need the smell of summer , I need its noises in my ears . ''
- He had missed the opportunity of enjoying summer because of their touring , and now it has passed by .
`` Please know we do this because we care , not for the thrill . ''
- They are doing these tours because they want to reach out to people with their music , not because they want to be away from their home .
`` I 've realized that everyone who lives will someday die and die alone '' - This is a very morbid line saying he is lonely , and with this work they are doing , he sees himself being alone forever .
This is reinforced by the chorus : `` And we wo n't let you in , '' meaning they will not allow anyone to become close with them .
`` I 've wrote more postcards then hooks , I 've read more maps then books , I feel like every chance to leave is another chance I should have took . ''
- He has written so many letters to home , perhaps more letters then songs , he has not had any time for things such as books , because he is on the road , and he feels like he should have taken any chances that had been offered for the touring to stop , but he did n't .
`` My secrets for a buck , Watch me as I cut myself wide open on this stage , Yes , I am paid to spill my guts '' - His songs are his deepest secrets , and he is paid to write and sing and be seen on stage .
`` Oh , I would kill for the Atlantic '' - Jesse Lacey is from Long Island , New York -LRB- an island surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean -RRB- .
`` I am paid to make girls panic while I sing '' - This expresses the absurdity of the many overexcited , screaming girls who attend his shows .
-LRB- thanks , Samantha - Someplace , NY , for above 2 -RRB-
