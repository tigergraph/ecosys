This song is a tribute to Marc Brueland , a good friend of Nightwish Keyboard player and the songwriter Tuomas Holopainen , who died of cancer .
Tuomas said that the first line of the chorus was taken from Lord Of The Rings : The Two Towers , when Legolas says something along the lines of , `` The red sun rises .
Blood has been spilt this night . ''
The second line of the chorus was a brief but accurate description of what Tuomas heard on the phone as he heard Marc drift off -LRB- `` Drown without inhaling '' -RRB- .
In addition , the other vocals in this song are that of the deceased , Marc Brueland .
-LRB- thanks , Dark - Sydney , Australia -RRB-
