Anthony Kiedis wrote this song after he had been dumped by Sinead O'Connor , his girlfriend at that time .
The song is about lying about cheating , which is what he thought he could have done to avoid getting dumped .
In an interview with Q magazine May 2009 , Sinead O'Connor denied she had a relationship with Anthony Kiedis .
She said : `` I hung out with him a few times and the row we had was cos he suggested we might become involved . ''
O'Connor also stated that she does n't `` give a s -- te about '' this song , adding '' `` I 'm not a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan .
I ca n't bear them , I do n't get it . ''
The music of this song was inspired by Jimi Hendrix ' `` All Along The Watchtower . ''
