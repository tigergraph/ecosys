This is the lead single from UK electronic band Hot Chip 's fifth studio album In Our Heads .
The track is described in publicity materials as `` weird-ass disco , '' which then adds : `` The song is driven by a menacing yet supremely danceable bassline , while Alexis 's digitally-messed up vocals float beautifully above it all like the ghost of Marvin Gaye . ''
The tune was released on June 11,2012 in the UK and the following day in the US .
Guitarist Al Doyle explained the `` please quit your jibba jabba line '' to Spin magazine : `` There was a little novelty Mr. T key ring that was left in the studio , '' he said .
`` The kind of thing that you had on your key ring if you were a Mr. T fan , obviously , or maybe it came in a cereal box .
It had all of his catch phrases on it .
It had the ` quit your jibber jabber ' line on it that appears in ` Night and Day . '
That was a real sort of rote lyric writing exercise on Alexis ' part I think .
It got annoying very very fast , and now the battery is gone on it because we pressed it too much . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Peter Serafinowicz .
`` Many animals were harmed during the making of this video .
Regrettably , none of them made the final edit , '' quipped the comic actor .
Serafinowicz previously helmed band 's clip for `` I Feel Better . ''
