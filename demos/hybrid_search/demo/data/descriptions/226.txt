In this song , Mariah sings about a relationship that did n't work out .
Unlike `` We Belong Together , '' which was a huge hit from the album , she sounds confident instead of heartbroken .
She makes sure her ex remembers the true love they had and reminds him that his new girl will never be her .
-LRB- thanks , Donovan Berry - El Dorado , AR -RRB- This was Mariah Carey 's 17th American # 1 song , putting Carey into a tie for second place with Elvis Presley among artists with the most # 1 hits in the Rock era in the US , behind the Beatles ' 20 .
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England -RRB-
