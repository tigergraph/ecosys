This ballad features Kanye West and The-Dream .
The latter produced this track along with Tricky Stewart .
The duo are best known for being behind Rihanna 's 2007 hit `` Umbrella .
This samples T-Pain 's 2008 hit single `` Ca n't Believe It . ''
Foxx previously collaborated with West on the latter 's 2005 chart-topper `` Gold Digger . ''
The actor/singer told BET 's 106 & Park that rumors of a possible fall out with West were nonsense .
He said : `` Kanye is my man and always will be .
The thing is , without Kanye I would n't have gotten in the music business and he knows that .
We got him on the record ` Digital Girl . '
He was actually performing somewhere in Germany and he took time out to give us a hot 32 bars .
He is rapping , which is rare because Kanye has moved to the singing thing .
We are all good and I 'll do anything for that dude . ''
