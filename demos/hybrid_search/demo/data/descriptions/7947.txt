Nine Inch Nails 1989 album Pretty Hate Machine has a song called `` Down In It '' with lyrics that formed the basis for this .
Example : `` Down In It '' : `` Just then a tiny little dot caught my eye ; it was just about too small to see .
But I watched it way too long ; it was pulling me down . ''
`` Only '' : `` Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye and it turned to be a scab and I had this funny feeling like I just knew it 's something bad . ''
This song is based on the movie Fight Club , which Fincher directed .
Lyrics like , `` You were never really real to begin with , I just made you up to hurt myself '' point to the main character in the film and his alter-ego Tyler Durden .
