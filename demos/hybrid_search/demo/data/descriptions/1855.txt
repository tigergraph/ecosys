Singer Cormac Neeson told Kerrang !
February 21 , 2009 , that on this bluesy number the band `` got a gospel singer in to bring out a bit at the end of the song , and it 's the whole kinda bluesy soulful thing , which is definitely a part of what The Answer is about . ''
Neeson added : `` With the lyrics , what I 'm trying to do is capture the spirit of youth , that kinda feeling when you 're young - there 's a reference to being hooked on Troublegum and Take The Power Back , bands like Therapy ?
and Rage Against The Machine I was into , when I was first starting to discover rock 'n' roll music and first starting to drink and play about with different things that I should n't really be playing about with . ''
