In our interview with Howard Jones , he said this song saw him question what `` love '' is : `` I did n't want to write songs about , ' I love you , baby , you 've hurt me and I 'm sad . '
I did n't want to write songs about co-dependency .
If I was going to write about love , I wanted to say what do we mean by love ?
What is it , really ?
`` Jones added : `` You ca n't be dependent upon another person for your happiness .
So you 'd better question this idea of romantic love pretty soon , otherwise you 're going to be pretty miserable .
So that 's really what that song is . ''
Howard Jones told us in 2011 that the song is still representative of how he feels about love : `` I feel the same as I did then , which is that for a relationship to work , to be really in love with somebody , you have to know who you are .
And they have to know who they are .
And then you kind of face the world together , rather than you clutching to the apron strings of the other person for their support .
This is my philosophy about that , really .
You ca n't be dependent on another person .
You have to know yourself so that you can then stand on your own .
Only then can you have a great relationship with somebody .
So that 's really what that song is indicating . ''
