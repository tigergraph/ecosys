This neo-gospel track features British R&B siren Estelle who is best known for her hit single `` American Boy . ''
Gym Class Heroes frontman Travis McCoy explained to Artist Direct how he hooked up with Estelle : `` She 's become a really good friend of mine over the past year .
We met when she had a showcase in New York .
We just hit it off .
She asked me to perform with her and do a verse on a song during her performance , and I said , ` Sure . '
We did the whole texting/email thing and kept in touch .
When it came time to do the record , on the demo , I actually sang the hook on ` Guilty as Charged , ' but I was like , ` Damn , I think Estelle would kill this part . '
We called her and sent her the track , and she killed it .
The breakdown of the song was kind of crazy .
Her vocals got crazy .
It 's just one of the high points on the record .
I loved it . ''
