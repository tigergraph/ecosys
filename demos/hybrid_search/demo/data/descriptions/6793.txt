Originating from France , Gojira is a metal band heavily influenced by environmental lyrics towards the planet and global warming .
This is mostly shown in the concept album From Mars To Sirius , in which the character has had enough of the way humans have treated their land and decides to make a journey to space to find the aliens that will help him restore Earth .
`` Global Warming '' is a summary of what has happened to the character .
The repetitive tapping riff and simple song structure remains mostly simple but is strong in reflecting the events that reflect the character 's journey .
The last lines , `` We Will see , our children growing '' explains that there is still hope and that we can still make a sustainable life in contrast to how we treat our land .
