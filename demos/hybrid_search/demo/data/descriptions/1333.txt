Allan told Country Weekly magazine that he came up with this song on a songwriting trip to Costa Rica with Odie Blackmon and Jim Lauderdale : `` I found a house that was in the middle of a wildlife preserve .
It was 6 hours from the airport .
We 'd never do it again , because it took too long to get to the airport .
It backed up to a marine preservation .
We could n't even get there by car , we had to have guys carry our stuff across the river and get us to this place .
I paid some lady to come and cook for us .
She charged me 7 dollars a day .
These fishing boats would come in in the morning and we would choose what we wanted to eat , and she would cook it that day .
We were woken up by baboons every morning .
Jim is quite the character - he 's way into tai chi and stuff like that .
I 'd have my coffee every morning and there were a few guys that gave jungle tours that would hike up to see us because they could hear us playing music .
There 's nothing forever , so you could hear us far away .
I just love the visual of those guys sitting there watching Jim do tai chi in the jungle.It 's the first time I 'd ever sat down and written 24/7 like that .
That 's all we did , was sit around with guitars and kick over stuff .
I needed that .
My wife had just passed .
I 'm sure they were looking at me going , ` He is a wealth of emotion right now . ' ''
Allan laughed then added : `` It was good for all of us .
The song that made the record off of that session was ` We Touched the Sun . ' ''
