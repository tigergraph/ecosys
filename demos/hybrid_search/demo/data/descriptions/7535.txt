The Heavy are a Funk/Rock band from England who spend a lot of time on the road , which inspired this song .
In our 2010 interview with lead singer Kelvin Swaby , he said the song was about `` Being on the road and missing the things that we truly , truly love .
Like your children .
And marmite . ''
Swaby wrote this song with The Heavy 's guitarist Dan Taylor .
Said Swaby : `` We had the chorus for ` Long Way From Home ' about 8 years ago .
Dan had that loop and chorus going .
And immediately the first thing I heard as soon as he played that is , ` Long way from home , so much pressure on my bones , I 'm such a long way from home . '
And we had that for 8 years , but we never had any verses .
Then we actually got signed , and we were away for so long .
Daniel has a little girl , and I have a little boy and a little girl , so when you 're spending so much time away from your family , you see a lot of airports .
And I think I was in Valencia airport , it just came to me after something like 6 years of having it around in my head .
For some reason , there was that ache in my heart , and everything just kind of came .
So I sang it into my phone so I would n't forget .
And then I said to Dan , ` This is the way that we need to go about this song . '
And we wrote it .
We wanted it so that it could be strummed .
So if we were around a campfire we could strum it out like that .
But then we said , ` No , it 's still Kinks-y .
So let 's do it Kinks-y . '
So we sit tight , the kind of acoustic guitar vibe , and just made it quite kind of Kinks-like .
Ray Davies . ''
