`` I just wanted to have a conversation , just put it out in the world and then see what happens , '' Fiasco told MTV News .
`` I think it 's something that 's very subtle , the idea of it , the ` bad bitch ' its very subtle , but it definitely has some destructive elements to it , especially when you look at who it 's been marketed towards , and that 's why we put the children in the video . ''
