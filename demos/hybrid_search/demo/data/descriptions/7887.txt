This contains similar themes to System Of A Down song `` Vicinity Of Obscenity , '' but is more in depth and attacks television as a main source of distribution .
Violent pornography is a new trend , especially in Internet porn .
There are multiple web sites dedicated to it , and if you actually watch this material you can see how misguided , drugged-up , lied to , and manipulated the `` actresses '' really are .
It delivers the same affect to the opposite gender ; a false view of women .
The song implies that organized religion , our food supply , the force feeding of entertainment -LRB- in a restaurant - play music , in an office - feed em ' magazines , in your house blare the TV , fill the mailbox with crap ; fill your mind with crap -RRB- , is all intended to prevent you from having a relationship with God and knowing the truth ; that your life has a purpose above obtaining material goods .
That there is a force out there with the intention of controlling your mind .
-LRB- thanks , Trevor - Lakebay , WA , for above 2 -RRB-
