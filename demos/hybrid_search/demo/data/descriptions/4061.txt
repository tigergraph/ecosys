This is the title track of American Heavy Metal band Mastodon 's fifth studio album .
The album was recorded at Doppler Studios in Atlanta with producer Mike Elizondo , who has worked on hit songs for an assortment of artists ranging from Dr. Dre to Fiona Apple .
It is Mastodon 's second non-concept album , the first being Remission .
This minimal and emotionally charged track is one of two songs on The Hunter reflecting on personal tragedies the band went through during the recording of the album , the other one being `` The Sparrow . ''
Speaking to Spin magazine , Hinds said of the song 's sonic vibe , `` It sounds like Zeppelin with these smooth buttery vocals and a huge Jimmy Page-style guitar solo .
Me and Brann play off each other also in this sort of proggy way . ''
The album was titled The Hunter in honor of guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds ' brother , Brad , who unexpectedly passed away while hunting in December 2010 .
Mastodon actually had two working titles for the album in honor of Brad : `` The Hunter '' or `` Brother . ''
Drummer/vocalist Brann Dailor told Kerrang !
: `` This is a very personal song for Brent .
It 's about his brother Brad , who passed in December .
It 's some heavy s -- t .
We were n't sure if Brent would want to write about it as it was pretty fresh .
But I think he had to .
I remember Brent 's aunt pulled me aside at the funeral and said , ` It 's going to be a hell of a song . '
Brent and Troy -LRB- Sanders , bass -RRB- sing on it and it sounds awesome .
I think they did a great job . ''
