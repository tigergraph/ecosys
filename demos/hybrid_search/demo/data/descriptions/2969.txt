Guitarist Ryan Ross recalled to VH1 : `` That was really cool .
I walked in one day and these guys were talking about the song and they said , ` Why do n't you try to sing this ? '
I sang it because it was me and Jon 's -LRB- bassist Jon Walker -RRB- song , -LRB- so -RRB- I knew the song well .
We did it and everyone thought it was cool .
It 's still one of the coolest songs on the album .
