This single from the deluxe Encore edition of Hunter Hayes ' debut album finds him crazy about a girl .
`` I do n't want good and I do n't want good enough , '' he sings .
`` I want ca n't sleep , ca n't breathe without your love ... I do n't want easy , I want crazy . ''
Hunter debuted the song at the 2013 Academy of Country Music Awards on April 7 , 2013 .
The song 's music video was directed by Ends and shot in Saint John , New Brunswick , Canada , during a break in Hunter 's tour with Carrie Underwood . .
The clip follows the young singer and his love interest as they try to make time for one another , even when Hunter has to be away from home .
`` The video is about a long-distance relationship and the toughness of having a long-distance relationship , 'cause that 's what kind of the song is about , '' Hayes said in a For The Love Of Music webisode .
`` It 's about the crazy things you do for someone when you 're crazy about them .
`` He added , `` It was awkward to act with someone I 've never really met but that 's acting , so I guess it was just hard to act .
But I guess I related to this 'cause I relate to the song .
I wrote the song and I guess that 's kind of what I kept going back to .
`` Another difficulty was that the weather did n't tie in what Hunter describes as a `` summer song . ''
`` The biggest issue with shooting the video was we kind of shot it on a day when it was 40 -LSB- degrees -RSB- and raining , '' he said .
`` That was bad timing . ''
Hayes told Radio.com that the title for `` I Want Crazy '' came to him before the song did . ''
` Crazy ' was just my way of saying , ` That 's real love .
When you feel like you 've gone crazy .
That 's when you 've actually gotten something right , ' '' he explained .
`` I do n't want the ` We can make this work , ' ` Sure , OK , it 's good . '
I incorporated this long distance aspect because , boy I can speak from experience on that stuff .
It was just a confessional way of saying that 's what I 'm looking for . ''
Hayes had to push for this to be included on the deluxe version of his eponymous debut album after the original Hunter Hayes record was locked and loaded .
`` I really believed in it , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` I really wanted it to be on a record ; I did n't know if it would be on the next one or whatever , but I told -LRB- producer Dann Huff -RRB- , ' I do n't care what we 're doing .
We 're doing this song ! '
It 's a new direction for me musically , a lot of new territory , and I was excited to tap into that territory .
We tried it and it evolved so quickly and sort of on its own that halfway through the process everybody felt the same way I did .
That was the first time I let my own intuition stand up for the music that strongly , and it worked . ''
Hunter told Radio.com he is honest about his emotions when penning such songs as this madly-in-love tune .
`` I 'm a big fan of just letting everything out on the table .
That 's why I write songs , that 's why I do what I do , '' he explained .
`` I 'm a big fan of just saying whatever is on your mind .
My filter 's not that great .
That 's how I think through everything . ''
Hayes co-wrote the song with singer-songwriters Troy Verges and Lori McKenna .
It was the first song that the trio had written together though Verges had previously collaborated with Hunter on the single `` Wanted . ''
`` It was a really normal writing day , '' recalled Verges to Roughstock .
`` We came in with the little lick that is the intro of the song .
We kind of had that and based the song around that .
`` I 'd gotten to know Hunter so well from writing for that last record , '' he continued , `` and I knew that he was a great guitar player , so we were trying to find a song to feature what he can do on guitar .
It was just an easy write .
It only took a couple of hours because the song was there .
`` Lori was such a great presence in the room .
I 've always loved writing with her , and I 've always been a massive fan of hers .
It was a real natural , back and forth , easy day .
It was more about the groove and the feel of the song for me to get rolling , then the lyrics just came .
Everybody in the room was just kind of shouting stuff out .
It was a rapid fire back and forth , where it feels like you 're not writing it . ''
Hayes ' self-titled debut set completed the longest ever ascent to # 1 on Billboard 's Country Albums when it reached the top in its 89th chart week .
The LP soared to peak position following the release of the deluxe edition , which was made available on June 18 , 2013 .
Hayes ' long climb to the peak position surpassed the 51 weeks it took Dixie Chicks ' Wide Open Spaces to reach the summit in 1999 .
