This was released as the first single from American alternative rock band Wilco 's seventh studio album , Wilco -LRB- The Album -RRB- .
Wilco played this on the Tonight Show with Conan O Brien on 24th June 2009 .
A number of critics have compared the sound of this pop/rock number to George Harrison 's '70s material .
Others have pointed out its similarity to the song structure of Harrison 's former Travelling Wilbury colleague Tom Petty 's 1987 single `` Jammin ' Me . ''
This was Wilco 's first # 1 on the Billboard Triple A radio chart , twelve years after the band 's Triple A debut , `` Outtasite -LRB- Outta Mind -RRB- , '' peaked at # 16 .
Wilco thus set the record for the longest wait between an act 's first hit and first # 1 on that particular tally .
The record was previously held by Alanis Morissette , who waited eight years between 1996 's `` Ironic `` and her first # 1 , 2004 's `` Everything . ''
In a twist that the `` Ironic '' songwriter may or may not appreciate , the song that launched Morissette 's career , -LRB- which did n't chart on Triple A -RRB- was the similarly titled , `` You Oughta Know . ''
