This song is suggestive of a sexual rendezvous and the lyrics are full of innuendo .
According to Mojo magazine , Tony Visconti , who produced and played bass on this track , claimed the song was written by Mick Ronson , who played lead guitar .
Visconti recalled that it was `` completely a Ronson composition ; Bowie did n't add lyrics till much later . ''
Angie Bowie , David 's wife at the time , adds in the magazine : `` We were watching TV one night and Led Zeppelin were on .
I looked at Mick and started to laugh and I went : ' I bet the Rats from Hull -LRB- Mick 's former band -RRB- could do a better blues song than that . ' ''
So they went down to the basement a couple of days later without David Bowie and came out with the music to `` She Shook Me Cold '' - a play on Led Zeppelin 's `` You Shook Me . ''
