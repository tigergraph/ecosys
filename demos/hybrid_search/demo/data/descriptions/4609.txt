This ballad was only included on the album thanks to Spitari 's friend , the comedian Peter Kay .
She explained to the Daily Record May 10 , 2008 that she was originally planning on rejecting this from the album : `` I was still making my mind up about the track listing when I played it to Peter .
Then Peter said , ` That 's not going on ?
Are ye deaf ? ' ''
