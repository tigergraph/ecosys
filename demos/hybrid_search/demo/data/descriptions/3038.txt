Ilikemusic.com asked Craig David , which track he enjoyed laying down most on the album .
He replied : `` It was probably ` She 's On Fire ' because I had a lot of fun writing the song .
It 's talking about how a girl was n't really a great looker at school , she was the one who focused on her studies and was n't running around with the older boys to be ahead of her age .
The gist of it is that over the period of time of leaving school , the girls who ran around with the older guys and trying to be ` it ' are now in a situation where they 've now got a couple of kids , two different fathers , not in a stable relationship , whereas the girl who focused on her studies and went on to university , now , it 's a clich√© , but her glasses are off , her hair 's down , her body 's formed and she looks amazing .
So it 's saying , take your time , there is no mad rush but sometimes people feel like when they 're at school they know best , do n't we all .
But I had fun making it , and it 's got a real hip hop meets reggae style , the music I listened to growing up as a kid and it 's got me doing a little rap on it and I was able to have a free reign on it . ''
