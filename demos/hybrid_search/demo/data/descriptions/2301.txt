McGraw broke down the song for the September 2010 American Express ' `` Pairings '' event during which he provided the musical entertainment .
He explained : '' ` Everywhere ' was this real crucial time in my career .
The story of the song is the love of your life that you ca n't get out of your head , no matter where you go .
Essentially , you can travel all over the place -- and us being gypsies as musicians are -- we tend to be drawn to those kind of songs .
I think that 's a current theme in music ... love and lost love and trying to get that love back . ''
