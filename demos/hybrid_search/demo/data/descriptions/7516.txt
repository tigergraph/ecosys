This song was written by D.L. Byron , a Pop-Rock singer who released his first album , This Day and Age , on Arista Records with Jimmy Iovine producing .
He wrote `` Shadows Of The Night '' for his second album , but he ran into creative differences with Arista and left the label without making the album .
The song went to Pat Benatar , who had some hits under her belt with `` Promises in the Dark '' and `` We Live For Love . ''
The song was a great fit for Benatar , with lyrics using bold imagery to assuage a lover.Like `` Hit Me With Your Best Shot , '' it was a song written by a man that Benatar had to reverse gender .
Her powerful voice and strong persona helped pull it off , as lines like `` baby take my hand , it 'll be all right '' are more typically delivered by the guy trying to comfort his damsel .
Benatar won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance , Female four years in a row .
`` Shadows Of The Night '' was her third win , following `` Crimes Of Passion '' and `` Fire And Ice , '' and preceding `` Love Is A Battlefield . ''
Pat Benatar was one of MTV 's early stars - her `` You Better Run '' clip was just the second video the network played when they launched in 1981 .
For `` Shadows Of The Night , '' a conceptual video was made showing Pat as a WWII flying ace doing her part to fight the Nazis while also singing from her aircraft .
We find out at the end that she is really a riveter , and it was all a dream.Benatar married her guitarist Neil Giraldo nine months before the Get Nervous album came out , and while Neil was her musical partner , he was n't big on the videos .
He told us : `` As videos got more popular , they became little stories or vignettes , and to me they did n't represent the song anymore .
They were like little commercials for people trying to make the interpretation of the words different than what they should have been .
So I was n't a big fan , and I hated it .
I was like , ` How could you do this ? '
Why would you do a song like ` Shadows of the Night ' and have it like a war scene ?
What is this ?
This is horrible .
Who thought this was a good idea ?
We made the rule that there would be no more historical costumes anymore after that video .
It just became stupid and senseless.But on the other hand , what a medium for trying to get music and songs out .
I knew it would be big , but I had no idea it would have that much impact .
Incredible . ''
