This was the band 's first single release from when they were signed to Heavenly Records , and though it did n't chart , the song 's maverick attitude garnered a lot of attention .
Since 1990 the Manics have performed this track at virtually all their gigs and it was included on their 2002 Forever Delayed greatest hits album .
Nicky Wire explained the song 's lyrics to The Quietus : `` It 's the classic idea of Pop music as vacuous .
We loved Motown , the basslines , but we felt pop had become redundant and did n't mean anything . ''
Bassist Nicky Wire and guitarist Richey Edwards wrote the song 's iconoclastic lyrics .
Singer James Dean Bradfield admitted to The Quietus that , `` I remember taking slight umbrage at ` Motown Junk ' as a title , cos I love -LRB- Marvelettes 1967 single -RRB- ` The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game , ' and songs like ` Baby Love , ' but when I saw Richey and Nick 's lyric I totally understood what they were getting at . ''
The Quietus asked if there was a particular song the band were thinking of with the lyric `` Stops your brain thinking for 168 seconds . ''
Wire replied : `` I think Richey thought that might have been the perfect length for a pop single .
It was my title .
We 'd written the song .
It had been knocking around for a bit , before Richey was in the band , but he transformed the lyrics into something better . ''
