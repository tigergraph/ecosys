Dixie Chick sisters , Martie Erwin Maguire and Emily Erwin Robison , co-wrote `` You Were Mine '' in 1995 .
It is about their parents ' break-up and subsequent divorce .
Robinson told Entertainment Weekly that her parents try to ignore the fact it is about them : `` Both our parents are very sweep-it-under-the-carpet .
They know it 's about them , but -LSB- whispers -RSB- we never talk about it .
-LSB- laughs -RSB- They do n't want to bring it up because they 're still weird around each other .
My dad does n't want to think it 's about him , because it does n't make him look very good , and my mom thinks she 's moved on .
She 'll say something like , ` You know , I really like that song , ' but we do n't talk about a lot of things . ''
Throughout the track , Natalie Maines ' powerful , grief-stricken lead vocals are backed the two sisters ' gentle harmonies and a sorrowful violin played by Martie Erwin , resulting in a pungent emission of sadness and loss .
In 1995 , the Erwin sisters invited Natalie Maines to sing lead vocals on the demo of `` You Were Mine . ''
The sisters were so impressed with Maines ' vocals that she went on to replace Laura Lynch , who was Dixie Chicks ' lead singer at the time .
`` You Were Mine '' is the only original song to appear on Dixie Chicks ' breakthrough album , Wide Open Spaces .
The song was a commercial success and reached number one on U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks .
