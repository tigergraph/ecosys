Brice penned this song with American singer-songwriter Billy Montana and frequent collaborator Jon Stone for his sophomore album , Hard 2 Love .
Brice believes it `` is one of the top two or three songs I 've written . ''
He explained , `` It 's probably the best track on the album , even from the first line , ` The Saturday downpour carved out rivers in the sand . '
It 's got this dream quality , and a really beautiful melody . ''
Brice said the lyrics were inspired by the first time he ever met his fianc√©e Sara whilst walking on North Myrtle Beach when he was around 18 years old : `` It 's about spending a seven-day vacation at the beach and meeting somebody , '' he explained .
`` The twist is that it was pouring down rain , and gray and misty and overcast the whole seven days .
But in the guy 's mind , it was perfect and the most incredible thing he ever experienced .
He 's lived those seven days a thousand times .
I wrote it about meeting Sara .
And I 'm connected to it because Myrtle Beach , where I 'm from , is the epic place to have that kind of spring break experience .
I think it will remind everybody of when they were in their teens .
When those days are gone , they 're gone man .
You can go back when you 're twenty-one or twenty-five .
But it 's never the same .
You do n't get those days back . ''
