This folk-tinged tune laments the fallen at the Battle of the Nek , fought as part of the Gallipoli campaign during the First World War .
On August 7 , 1915 two regiments of the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade mounted a tragic and futile attack on the Ottoman trenches on a knoll known as Baby 700 .
The disastrous engagement left nearly 400 Australian cavalrymen dead .
