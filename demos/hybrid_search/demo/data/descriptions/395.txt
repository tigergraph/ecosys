The Jonas Brothers explained to the Australian radio program The Hot Hits that this song , `` is an homage to some of our favorite contemporary bands : U2 , Kings Of Leon and Muse . ''
The trio added that they thought , `` it deals with the biggest mistake we all make which is dwelling on the past instead of just making strides towards the future .
All too often we get stuck spinning our wheels trying to fix things without ever realizing how much life is passing us by , because we 've forgotten how much there is to just look forward to . ''
