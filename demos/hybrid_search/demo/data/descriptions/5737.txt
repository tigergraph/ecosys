Bowersox and musician Brian Walker were married on October 10 , 2010 at Uncommon Ground Caf√© in Chicago , the restaurant where the couple had met 6 years earlier while both performing at Open Mic Night .
Many of the love songs on Farmer 's Daughter were written by a frustrated Bowersox before her tenure on American Idol in an attempt to get Walker 's attention .
`` I was sending him singles - I mean signals - left and right , like , ` Hello , I 'm here !
Love me ! '
... That 's what ` Kiss Ya ' was about , '' Bowersox revealed to Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo Music .
