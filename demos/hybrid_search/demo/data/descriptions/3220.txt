This song is about what Nas experienced growing up in the ghetto and is a very uplifting song .
At the beginning of each verse his voice starts out quiet and builds up until he is yelling at the end of the verse , except for the last verse where he starts out yelling and gets quiet by the end of it .
-LRB- thanks , bob - boston , MA -RRB- Nas spoke to Rolling Stone magazine about this song : `` I 'm a huge fan of Phil Collins and I just wanted to take the vibe from ` In the Air Tonight . '
` One Mic ' is just about the power .
It 's almost like Hip Hop is Dead in its infant stages , saying how much this is a blessing to be out here , speaking about what 's happening in my neighborhood , having the whole world understand and relate .
I ca n't understand how Bill O'Reilly can be angry at a song called ` Shoot 'Em Up . '
If I did n't have a microphone , I could never talk about ` Shoot 'Em Up , ' and I was talking about Queens , New York , being shot up .
What do I have to do to get somebody to turn around and hear what I 'm saying and take it serious ?
I 'm not here just to be in your face talking nonsense , we 're talking about reality .
For him to be upset or people like him to be upset is insane to me .
It just shows how ignorant people are .
` One Mic ' just gives me the ability , no matter how much ignorant people are mad that I 'm exposing or talking about our country , no matter what the language is , I 'm talking in a language that the people can hear , I 'm not sugar-coating it .
So if it scares people and people feel guilty , people feel like they 've got to make up excuses to why the world 's this way , no matter what they say , like they 've got their mic , I 've got mine , and that 's what that song 's about . ''
This borrows from Phil Collins ' `` In The Air Tonight . ''
