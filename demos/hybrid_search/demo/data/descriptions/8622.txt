The eighth track on Wrecking Ball is a simple bluesy number , in which Springsteen tells his girl , `` Ai n't no school ever taught it , ai n't no one ever bought it - but baby , you got it . ''
After the economic despair of the first seven tracks , this lusty little pop rock gem comes as a light relief .
It also acts as a prelude to the gospel theme of the final three tracks .
