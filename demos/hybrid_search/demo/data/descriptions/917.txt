This song is about the death of Lucinda 's former manager Frank Carrali while she was away on tour .
She told the website Elsewhere : `` We were in Copenhagen when we heard of his death .
The song is very literal .
I 'm , proud of that one , lyrically .
It was snowing a little bit and we had the night off and found out about it .
Tom -LRB- Overby -RRB- and I and our tour manager at the time walked down the street from the hotel and went to a bar and I ended up talking to these people all night , drinking and crying and trying to deal with the suddenness of it . ''
