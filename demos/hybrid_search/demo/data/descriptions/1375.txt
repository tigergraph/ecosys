This is based on a true story about a woman who was abducted by a man and his wife .
She was tortured , degraded , and confined during the day in a small box no bigger than a coffin for 6 years .
The woman became conditioned with `` Stockholm Syndrome . ''
This condition sometimes occurs when a person finally gives themselves willing to their captor and believes they are in love with them , or at least understands and accepts their captivity without resistance .
-LRB- thanks , James - Dartmouth , Canada -RRB- Corey Taylor : `` Can you imagine a girl being buried in a box and having all this lecherous bulls -- t drip down on her from this guy ?
And thinking that there is hope , because this kid is taking some bizarre note to this guy he does n't even know - thinking that you are holding on to the shirt of hope - and you wake up and you 're dead , you 're buried in mud - they find the note about a week later shoved in a library book .
It just hurts your head , it 's a case of what is good and bad in people .
The box alone is reason enough to be like , ' I cant stand to be f -- king human . '
What is inside of us that is so f -- king wrong ?
He had written quotes from Edgar Allen Poe and lots of f -- ked up things on the box . ''
