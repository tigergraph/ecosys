Penned by Truckers ' guitarist Jason Isbell , this song describes the advice given to him by his own father , including such gems as , `` Do n't call what you 're wearing an outfit . ''
Isbell told Uncut magazine -LRB- February 2014 -RRB- : `` A lot of these are direct quotes , or references to things which was strange pet peeves of his when I was a kid -- the chorus especially , I was trying to show what kind of person he was .
When I was born my dad was 19 , my mother was 17 , and 34 now , and I 'm barely scratching the surface of figuring out how to be a grown-up .
After I wrote it I played it for him , sure did .
He 's a bighearted guy , he got up bit of a tear . ''
