This island-flavored , feel-good track finds Ciara celebrating females `` making up their own rules . ''
The song was penned by African-American singer and songwriter Wynter Gordon , whose international breakthrough came when she co-wrote and sung the hook on Flo Rida 's worldwide hit , `` Sugar . ''
The summer jam was produced by Rodney Jerkins ' close friend and musical associate D'Mile .
Jerkins has worked with Ciara on several of her albums .
Nicki Minaj comes at the latter part of the tune with a verse .
The Queens MC also contributed to another Ciara track , `` I 'm Out '' and the Princess of Crunk previously featured on Minaj 's song `` I 'm Legit '' from Pink Friday : Roman Reloaded -- The Re-Up .
D'Mile 's beat samples a morsel of American Hip-Hop duo Kid 'N Play 's 1988 song `` Rollin ' With Kid 'N Play . ''
