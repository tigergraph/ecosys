This is a track from Dark is the Way , Light is a Place , the fifth studio album by American alternative rock band Anberlin .
The song was influenced by the band 's 2009 South American tour , where they discovered Brazilian music and its African-influenced percussion .
Frontman Stephen Christian recalled recording the tune to Spin Magazine : `` It started with the beat and then the music rolled , the lyrics rolled .
Then , we got down on the ground in the studio and just started clanging on anything we could find , from 2x4s to the side of a broken tom drum . ''
Lyrically , the song is a cry from Christian to see the `` real '' faces of people , something that 's become harder to do since the band found success .
He explained to Spin : `` We all have this game face , this show that we put on , but I feel there 's more to people than that , and I wanted more out of people than just what they 're showing . ''
