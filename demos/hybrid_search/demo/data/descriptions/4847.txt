The first song that Swift wrote for Red , she penned the tune in 2011 with Liz Rose , one of her co-writers on her first three albums .
The heart-rending break-up tune came after a six-month writing block that followed a particularly painful ending of a relationship .
`` There 's a kind of bad that gets so overpowering you ca n't even write about it , '' she told USA Today of that time .
`` When you feel pain that is so far past dysfunctional , that leaves you with so many emotions that you ca n't filter them down to simple emotions to write about , that 's when you know you really need to get out . ''
Taylor is a noted fan of singer/songwriter Matt Nathanson of `` Come On Get Higher '' and `` Run '' fame , to the extent that she has been known to perform with the lyrics of his song `` Modern Love '' written on her arm .
Fans have pointed out the similarity between a lyric in this song -LRB- `` And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to '' -RRB- , and a line from Nathanson 's 2003 tune `` I Saw , '' -LRB- `` And I 'll forget about you long enough to forget why I need to '' -RRB- .
Maybe Taylor wanted to pay homage to Nathanson or it may be simply unconscious plagiarism on her part .
However , Nathanson seems to believe it to be plagiarism .
According to the Gawker site , he posted a tweet after the rumors first surfaced that was subsequently deleted , in which he wrote , `` She 's definitely a fan , and now she 's a thief . ''
Swift was asked by The Daily Beast if she ever felt guilty regarding writing about an ex .
She replied : `` I take these songs and these people who inspire these songs on a case-by-case basis .
If there were someone who was a good person , I 'm not going to write something bad about them .
But if they handle a situation in a way that really messed up my life for a while , that 's what I 'm going to write about .
For me , I 've never changed the reason I write a song .
Songs for me are like a message in a bottle .
You send them out to the world and maybe the person who you feel that way about will hear about it someday . ''
