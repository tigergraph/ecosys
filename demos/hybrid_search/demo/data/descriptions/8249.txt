This Vicky McGehee , Neil Thrasher and Wendell Mobley penned song has a '70s rock sound .
However , Aldean told Billboard magazine that was n't always the case .
`` The biggest thing with songs like that is being able to rock those songs up a bit , '' he said .
`` You may hear a demo that kind of sits there , and you can spice them up just by the tones of the guitars , the production of it , and not being scared or thinking , ` we need a fiddle on this thing 'cause this is country music . '
I do n't think there 's a fiddle on the whole record , honestly .
It 's not because I do n't like fiddle , but I would rather hear a raunchy guitar than somebody sawin ' on a fiddle , that 's just the way it is .
I think people are scared a lot of times to go in and rock up a song a little bit , make it more aggressive , and that 's something we 've always done .
It gives songs a whole new sound . ''
