This Tales Of Us track was inspired by a trip that vocalist Alison Goldfrapp made to Iceland .
Also of influence were her obsession with water and myths , plus the 2013 movie Philomena .
She explained to The Idolator : `` I read a lot of noir books and I 'm a huge fan of European cinema -- all these things fed into the narrative of the music and also the narrative of the lyrics .
I wanted to make something where each song felt like a little film . ''
