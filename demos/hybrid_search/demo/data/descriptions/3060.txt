The opening track from Eclipse , the fourteenth studio album by American rock band Journey , includes the line , `` Never stop believing . ''
The lyric was written about the band 's Filipino lead singer Arnel Pineda , who joined the band in 2007 .
Keyboardist and guitarist Jonathan Cain explained to Spinner UK : `` When we were in Manila , Neal -LRB- Schon , guitarist -RRB- and I wrote it in a hotel room .
I had these lyrics come to me , like they do , and I got inspired meeting -LSB- Pineda 's -RSB- family and friends and going to places he grew up .
And I thought , `` This guy is the ` Do n't Stop Believin '' song .
He is the city boy that grew up the hard way .
And he found his way to YouTube , and somehow we looked at him through a window and chose him as the successor . '' ''
