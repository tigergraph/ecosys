This is a track from the self-titled debut solo album by producer and TV on the Radio guitarist Dave Sitek , recorded under the guise of Maximum Balloon .
The song features New York-based singer-songwriter Holly Miranda .
Sitek told The Guardian : `` I first heard Holly singing in a hallway and insisted on recording a full-length record with her .
She is the real deal .
She 's constantly pushing herself .
You can be like , ` Hey , do a cover of a GG Allin song ' and the next day you 'll get the MP3 in your mailbox .
She 's hilarious .
Her vocals on The Lesson are so focused I was able to strip the music down around them while retaining a cinematic quality .
I love this track , it 's a heavyweight . ''
