The songs Harvey wrote for her eighth studio album , Let England Shake , were motivated by the ongoing conflicts in the world .
The English alternative rock singer-songwriter told NME : `` In The Dark Places , that might be Bosnia .
You do n't know where it is .
I was wanting to show the way history repeats itself , really and so in some ways it does n't matter what time it was , because this endless cycle goes on and on and on . ''
