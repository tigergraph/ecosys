Gaga explained in a tweet that this track from her Born This Way Special Edition album is about the late Alexander McQueen .
The fashion designer committed suicide by hanging on February 11 , 2010 and Gaga was deeply affected by the tragic death of McQueen , who was a close personal friend .
That same month , she performed at the 2010 Brit Awards wearing one of his couture creations and she also paid tribute to her late friend by setting the date on the prison security cameras in her Telephone video as the same day that McQueen 's body was discovered in his London home .
