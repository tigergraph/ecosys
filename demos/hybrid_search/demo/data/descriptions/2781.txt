The line , `` Every dog has his day '' is from a 1863 children 's book called Water Babies by the English novelist and clergyman Charles Kingsley .
The line , `` In the dog days , People look to Sirius '' is a clever pun .
One meaning is that in the summer people are often serious but as written it means that people are looking to the dog star `` Sirius . ''
