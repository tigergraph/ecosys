Florida Metalcore band Trivium introduce their fifth studio album In Waves with this minute and a half opener built off the bridge guitar riff from the middle of the title track .
Frontman Matt Heafy explained to Alternative Press : `` One day , -LSB- bassist -RSB- Paolo -LSB- Gregoletto -RSB- mentioned that I should record that bridge section , on a clean tone , onto a new blank track .
At first , I did n't understand the purpose .
But eventually , after layering some of the bridge parts , we added the chorus riff of ` In Waves ' on top.The next thing that occurred was us layering tons of different guitars with different tones and tunings , all -LSB- of which were -RSB- playing the theme of the song .
The ` war drums ' were -LSB- created by using -RSB- drum sticks wrapped in napkins and duct tape beating down on flipped-over kick drums and toms .
The snare and stick-click percussion was laid on top -- -LSB- and -RSB- finally , the distorted , out-of-tune , real piano -LSB- was added -RSB- on top . ''
