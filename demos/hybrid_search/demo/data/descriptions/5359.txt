This song is about the horrors of war .
Waits took the title from graffiti that he read had been scribbled on the walls of Alcatraz , which was a notorious prison located on an island off San Francisco , and is now a popular tourist attraction .
The genesis of this song dates back to the period between Real Gone and Orphans in the mid 2000s , when Waits claimed to be working on an album called `` Hell Brakes Luce . ''
Red Hot Chili Pepper Flea plays bass on this track , whilst Rolling Stone Keith Richards also contributes some guitar work .
The song 's music video was directed by photographer Matt Mahurin , who has also helmed visuals for U2 , Peter Gabriel , and Bush .
It finds Waits towing a house in an aquatic war zone .
`` Matt Mahurin has created an apocalyptic war dream to accompany the song ` Hell Broke Luce , ' '' explained Wait .
`` Kathleen -LSB- Brennan -RSB- and I envisioned it as an enlightened drill sergeant yelling the hard truths of war to a brand new batch of recruits .
The video grew from the gnawing image of a soldier pulling his home , through a battlefield , at the end of a rope . ''
