This is the first single from the Los Angeles Rap-Metal band Hollywood Undead 's sophomore album .
The song is sung from the viewpoint of someone that has faced a great deal of adversity in his life and now has little hope for the future .
J-Dog explained the song 's meaning during an interview with Artist Direct : `` The song is a little bit of a departure from what the world is used to hearing from us .
We had experimented with some new sounds and different ways of writing songs .
Technically , when we wrote ` Hear Me Now , ' it was about what various people in the band were going through at the moment .
It could mean something different to everyone because we have so many writers on each song .
Everyone wrote his own part and based it on what he was going through in his own life .
It 's a deep song .
It 's about someone going through some tough times , getting dragged through the dirt , and where you come out in the end .
It 's like taking a look at yourself and realizing what you 've been through .
Everyone 's been through some hard s -- t recently .
I feel that song reflects on that .
Anyone can connect to it . ''
Guitarist J-Dog told Noisecreep as part of an in the studio interview that the album was being made on the cheap : `` We are in the studio , and our studio right now is basically our bedrooms , for the most part , '' he told the site .
`` It keeps the costs down .
We went to big studios and spent thousands of dollars every day for our last record , since we did n't know any better and the label was paying for it .
Now we do the writing at our house .
We will take it to producer when we 're done writing .
I sleep in my studio , on Oralex , the foam that pads the room .
It 's like egg-crate foam . ''
