This is a track from Welsh vocalist Dame Shirley Bassey 's album , The Performance , her first studio LP of new songs in two decades .
Barlow appeared with the Diva in a BBC TV documentary in November 2009 in which he said it took him some time to perfect the song .
It was reminiscent of Rodgers & Hammerstein , and uses the 6th , which he described as `` a very old fashioned note '' -LSB- meaning , obviously , the interval -RSB- , adding `` I 've been wanting to do one for years '' .
`` This Time '' had to be edited considerably , but in the end as musical director Mike Dixon said , it stopped being his song and became her song .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England -RRB- This song was penned for Dame Shirley by Take That songwriter Gary Barlow .
He recalled to The Daily Mirror : `` I had to go to the studio and sing it to her ; it was so nerve-racking .
I came up with the song by going on Wikipedia and looking back over her life .
She 's an amazing woman . ''
