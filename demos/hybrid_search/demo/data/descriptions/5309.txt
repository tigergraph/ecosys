Branch told Billboard magazine this is , `` a love song to the records that inspired me to pick up a guitar - Led Zeppelin or the Beatles or the Rolling Stones , AC/DC , that kind of stuff . ''
The up-beat pop/rock track was written and produced with British songwriter-producers , James Irvin and Julian Emery , who are best known for their collaborations with American singer-songwriter Lissie .
Branch explained on an Ustream chat : `` I had been listening to the Lissie record , and her song , ` When I 'm Alone ' is one of my favorite songs out right now .
I found out that Jim and Julian were responsible for it , so I wanted to work with them . ''
