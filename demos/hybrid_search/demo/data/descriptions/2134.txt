In January 2009 Scottish singer-songwriter Tommy Reilly won the Channel 4 Orange Unsigned Act competition , a sort of cooler X-Factor/American Idol , which set out to recognize the very best undiscovered music talent .
Part of Reilly 's prize was a release for both a single and album by Universal Music 's A&M Records .
Consequently , this song was immediately released online and within a week it had entered the UK Top 20 .
Reilly thus went from unsigned artist to a charting act within a space of seven days .
