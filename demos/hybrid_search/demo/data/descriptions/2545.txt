This is a collaboration with Paul Weller and is a remake of his 1993 UK hit `` Wild Wood . ''
Gabrielle says in the October 5 , 2007 Daily Mail : `` Some people think it 's lazy to take someone else 's song as a starting point , but I see it as a challenge . ''
She also comments on Paul Weller : `` I 've met Paul before , but I never thought I 'd have him on one of my songs .
He has a reputation for being super cool , but he was lovely . ''
