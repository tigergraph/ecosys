This song was written by Al Kooper , Bob Brass , and Irwin Levine .
They originally came together under publisher Hal Webman and his company We Three Music , though they eventually turned to freelancing songs they had written .
During this freelance period , they sold `` This Diamond Ring '' to Aaron Schroeder for $ 300 .
They originally wrote it with The Drifters in mind .
The Drifters turned the song down , so next Bobby Vee 's producer Snuff Garrett picked it up .
Bobby Vee did n't want it , but Garrett found a good home for the song in a new band he discovered on a visit to Disneyland : Gary Lewis & the Playboys .
He played the demo for Gary , who loved the song .
When it was issued as the group 's first single , it became a huge hit in America , and the first of seven Top-10 hits for the group .
This song is a classic case of lyrical dissonance : the upbeat melody belies the melancholy lyrics , as the once shimmering diamond ring now represents a love that is lost .
Despite the rather obvious meaning , Lewis tells us that people still misinterpret the song .
`` A lot of people love ` This Diamond Ring , ' but they think it 's a getting together song , '' says Lewis .
`` They say to me , ` Hey , we got married because of ` This Diamond Ring . ''
I say , ` Really ? '
I mean , it 's a breakup song . ''
In his book Backstage Passes and Backstabbing Bastards , Al Kooper relates that he and his fellow songwriters , Brass , and Levine were `` revolted '' by the Playboy 's version , because they 'd removed the soul from what should have been an R&B song and `` made a teenage milkshake out of it . ''
Kooper in the same book goes on to recount : `` To out surprise , after a hype-ridden sendoff on The Ed Sullivan Show -LRB- once again , several of our songs were showcased by Sullivan acts -RRB- , all you could hear on the radio was our turkey milkshake . ''
The song eventually climbed up the charts to # 1 , pushing out `` You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' . ''
Some of the top Los Angeles session musicians played on this track .
These were some of the same folks who played on records by The Beach Boys and The Monkees , but unlike The Monkees , the Playboys did play on their songs .
Regarding the musicians who performed on this and other tracks by the band , Gary Lewis told us , `` The Playboys played on every track we ever did , the Wrecking Crew did solos and overdubs .
I sang every song myself and had a backup singer that sang only harmonies with me .
My producer Snuff Garrett can back up everything I 've told you , and so can Leon Russell , who was the arranger of everything I did .
`` Some of the Wrecking Crew musicians Lewis refers to include Russell -LRB- piano -RRB- , Tommy Alsup -LRB- guitar -RRB- and Hal Blaine -LRB- drums -RRB- .
This song was the beginning of a run of hits for Gary Lewis & the Playboys , which ended after Lewis was drafted and entered the army .
Lewis credits his producer Snuff Garrett for making sure this was n't their only hit .
Said Lewis : `` We 're hearing it on the radio and we 're all just flipping out beyond belief , because it 's getting so much airplay and they wanted us to do all the local TV shows with the song .
So we were flying real , real high .
And Snuffy Garrett calls us in one day and says , ` Listen , you guys , I know it 's exciting and all that .
But you 've got to calm down . '
He says , ` You know how many one-hit artists there are out there ? '
`` The group followed this up with `` Count Me In , '' which went to # 2 .
Next was `` Save Your Heart for Me , '' also a # 2 hit .
Carving out room in the Pop landscape in 1965 was extremely difficult , as The Beatles were dominating the charts and still touring .
It took a concerted promotional effort and some clever timing to get this song noticed .
Snuff Garrett made sure to time the Gary Lewis & the Playboys releases so they did n't conflict with Beatles singles , and the band hit the road .
Said Lewis , `` Right when it came out we went on a Dick Clark Caravan of Stars tour with about ten other acts - six to eight weeks of one-nighters .
And so we were always in the public eye , and whatever town we were going into we did local TV to promote the show for that evening .
So we were constantly in the public eye .
I think that 's what it takes , along with a good record .
That 's what we did all those years . ''
