This song was written by the four band members of Coldplay and is left over from their recording sessions for Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends .
Imbruglia recalled to The Mail On Sunday January 10 , 2010 : `` I was putting the finishing touches to my Come to Life album when Chris Martin called me out of the blue .
He said , ` I 've got this song called Lukas .
It 's the best thing I 've ever written .
But I want you to record it and not Coldplay . '
My only option was to gratefully accept the gift .
After that he came to the studio and helped me finish a few other songs for the album .
He 's so creative it takes your breath away .
When he 's working on a song he 's like a mad professor with these sparks of inspiration constantly flying out of his head .
He can be very blunt in his criticism , but that did n't bother me .
He 's Chris Martin .
If he offers you criticism , he 's always going to be right . ''
Viva la Vida producer Brian Eno helmed this track .
The English musician , composer and knob twiddler has worked with some of the biggest name in music including David Bowie and Talking Heads and Imbruglia was very much in awe of him .
She told BBC News : `` Brian Eno is someone that you do n't want to sound stupid in front of , and everything he said , I was just like , ` Wow ' .
I lost my tongue that day . ''
