Norman explained the background behind the lyrics on his website : `` I have silently walked the last four years or so with a building and recently diagnosed struggle with anxiety .
The irony is that the struggle has been with the one thing I have always found comfort and consistency in - singing the songs that I so dearly love to sing .
This song is about letting go of the earthly things that drag me down and holding tightly to the things of heaven that pull me out . ''
