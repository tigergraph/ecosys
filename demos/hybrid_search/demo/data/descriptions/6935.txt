Vocalist Yannis Philippakis told NME that this is one of several Foals songs that are `` like a little film still . ''
He gave the examples of `` Miami `` and `` Spanish Sahara '' as falling into the same category .
Yannis added that the `` little story that 's semi-articulated '' in this song 's lyrics , is `` to do with being a fugitive with your loved one and then a terrible car accident happens and you 're haunted by somebody 's memory .
It felt smoky '' he concluded , `` it had a kind of soul influence and it felt like we had n't done it before . ''
