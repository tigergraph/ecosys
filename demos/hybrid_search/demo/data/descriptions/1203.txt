The first single from American Idol season 8 finalist Danny Gokey 's second album was penned by Cary Barlowe , Shane Stevens and Josh Kear .
Barlowe and Stevens write in both the Christian Contemporary genre -LRB- TobyMac 's `` Tonight '' -RRB- and Country/Pop Lady Antebellum 's `` American Honey '' -RRB- .
Nashville songwriter Josh Kear 's credits include `` Need You Now '' for Lady Antebellum and Carrie Underwood 's `` Before He Cheats . ''
Gokey 's personal story of losing his wife , Sophia , four weeks before auditioning for American Idol seems to be reflected in the tune , so it was no surprise that he was drawn to its message .
`` I like to talk about songs that carry a lot of experience , '' he admitted to The Boot .
`` To me , it carries a lot of meaning .
` Second Hand Heart ' talks about how people have been in relationships .
Basically , it 's the guy saying to the girl , ` I 've got wounds , I 've got scars and I 'm not perfect , I have a second-hand heart .
It knows a lot more than in past relationships , because it 's learned a lot more and it knows what it likes now .
I want to take this second-hand heart and give it to you , and give more than it 's given anyone else . '
It 's like looking at a pair of jeans at a second-hand store , it 's been used .
The song title is very clever . ''
