This is the first single from Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan 's album , Laws of Illusion .
It was McLachlan 's first studio album of new material in seven years , since Afterglow in 2003 .
In the years between these two releases McLachlan married , separated , and raised two young daughters .
On the disc the singer looks at love from both sides and this upbeat , piano -- based song , has a musical atmosphere matched to lyrics that describe the heady thrill of new love : `` I 'm alive and I 'm on fire/Shot like a starburst into the sky . ''
This song , along with the rest of the album , was produced by McLachlan 's longtime creative collaborator Pierre Marchand , and together they co-wrote a number of the compositions .
`` Pierre and I have worked together for over twenty years , '' said the Canadian singer in press materials `` I co-wrote a lot with him on this record , more so than in the past .
It 's an intimate thing to write with somebody , to reveal oneself like that .
But I feel incredibly comfortable with him -- there are no judgments .
Pierre really contributed a lot to the lyrics of some of these songs .
He could come up with just the right choice of words -- simple but meaningful -- to fit the story we were trying to tell . ''
