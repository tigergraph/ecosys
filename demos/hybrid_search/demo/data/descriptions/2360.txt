This is the title track of American rock band Saving Abel 's second album .
Lead singer Jared Weeks explained : `` The message of the song is simple - it tells a story of a soldier writing home to his mom , family , wife , and kids .
Throughout the song you get the feeling of what it is like to be so far away from your home , your life , and your loved ones , but still having to soldier up and do what you came there to do .
It offers the message of not giving up , not losing love , and not running away . ''
Saving Abel spent a week on an USO / Armed Forces Entertainment tour of the Persian Gulf , during which the band visited eight military bases , performing seven concerts for the troops in Qatar , Kuwait , and Iraq .
Weeks explained the album title was the band wanting `` to give something back '' to the American soldiers who serve overseas .
He said , `` Having just returned from our USO tour of Iraq , Kuwait and Qatar , we all seemed to be on the same page when it came to naming the album .
Just being out there with those men and women who do so much for us and the country we live in , we really wanted to give them something back .
So for all of us , Miss America was the perfect name , for a perfect situation . ''
