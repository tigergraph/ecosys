This stripped down ballad from former Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Scherzinger 's debut solo album , Killer Love , is just her voice accompanied by a piano .
She told Billboard magazine : `` A lot of the music comes from heartbreak , something a lot of people can relate to .
Everything on the album has to do with relationships and with love .
They have to have meaning to me .
` AmenJena ' is the most personal , most vulnerable , most intimate song I have ever written .
I want to share a whole other side of me .
It 's a lot deeper than Pussycat Dolls . ''
