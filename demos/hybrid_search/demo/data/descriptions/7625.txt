The only Beach Boys release between Holland -LRB- 1973 -RRB- and 15 Big Ones -LRB- 1976 -RRB- , this song was released two days before Christmas and thus had no chance of commercial success .
It is now an almost impossible single to find and was released for the first time on album for the 1998 Ultimate Christmas set , though it was intended for the 1977 Christmas album .
The `` Grinch '' voice is Brian Wilson .
-LRB- thanks , Joe - West Creek , NJ , for above 2 -RRB-
