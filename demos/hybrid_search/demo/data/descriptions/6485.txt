This hymn to Seasick Stick 's trusty one-stringed bass is the opening track on the American bluesman 's fourth album , Man From Another Time .
The record was produced , written and co-engineered by Seasick Steve who performed everything , aside from drums which are credited to his longstanding Swedish sticksman Dan Magnusson .
The song is basically a set of instructions for replicating one of Steve 's distinctive home-made instruments , in this case his one-string Diddley-bow -LRB- a 2x4 with a string nailed to it -RRB- .
The Diddley-bow , which is played with a slide , is significant to blues music in that many blues guitarists got their start playing it as children .
