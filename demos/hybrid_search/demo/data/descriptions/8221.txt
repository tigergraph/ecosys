Michael Jackson originally recorded this on his 1987 album Bad .
Many of Alien Ant Farm 's fans are too young to know about Jackson 's version .
This was included on their first album , which was released on an independent label .
When they signed with a big record company , they included it on their first major-label release , ANThology .
The video pokes fun at Michael Jackson , but they made sure to get his permission and keep it lighthearted .
Some of the Michael Jackson clich√©s they make fun of are Bubbles the chimp and the Moonwalk .
This was nominated for a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Song .
This made Alien Ant Farm famous , but it was not their first single .
They released `` Movies '' first , but Los Angeles radio station KROQ started playing this instead , which led to a great deal of exposure and prompted them to release it as a single .
`` Movies '' was re-released later to take advantage of their new fame .
Alien Ant Farm have played a lot of quirky covers over the years .
When they started , they tried to play a different cover at every show .
Some of the bands they covered include Weezer , Bad Brains , The Police , and Sade .
When Jackson saw the video , he asked that a scene with a boy in a surgical mask be removed , because it made fun of his medical condition .
They took it out , but Jackson decided he liked it the way it was .
In the end , there were 2 videos , one with the mask , one without .
