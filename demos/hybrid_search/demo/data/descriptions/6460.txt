This song is about the breakup of Swift 's relationship with Joe Jonas .
She told The Los Angeles Times October 26 , 2008 : `` It 's about watching somebody fade away in a relationship .
They said they were going to be with you forever , that they loved you , and then something changed in the relationship and you do n't know what it is , but you 're watching them slowly drift .
That emotion of rejection , for me , usually starts out sad and then gets mad .
This song starts with this pretty melody that 's easy to sing along with , then in the end I 'm basically screaming it because I 'm so mad .
I 'm really proud of that . ''
Swift wrote this near the end of the recording process after she broke up with Joe Jonas .
The singer had to plead with the president of her record label , Scott Borchetta , to let her add it to the album a day before the final version was due to be turned in .
Swift told The Los Angeles Times that on this song , she felt as though she achieved something authentic and raw .
She explained : `` When I go into the studio , it 's really more about portraying the song in a way that gets the feeling across , rather than every phrase being exactly perfect .
I think it 's the writer in me that 's a little more obsessed with the meaning of the song than the vocal technique .
All that stuff is like math to me .
Over-thinking vocals and stuff - I never want to get to that point . ''
Joe Jonas told the June 2009 issue of Seventeen magazine that he was n't bothered about Taylor writing about the break-up of their relationship .
He said : `` It 's flattering .
It 's always nice to hear their side of the story . ''
