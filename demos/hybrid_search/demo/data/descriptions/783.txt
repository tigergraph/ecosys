Coxon told The Observer that he wrote many of the tracks on A&E in an auto-suggestive manner , by making `` vowel-like noises '' over the top of the guitar .
`` If you do that and tuck it down into the recorded music , it suggests words and sentences , sparks off a whole load of thoughts , '' he explained .
Many of those thoughts concern his current worries , such as this furious anthem , which sees Coxon depict the violence of a suburban night out .
`` This album is absolutely covered with my own paranoia and neuroses , '' he said .
Coxon studied Fine Arts at Goldsmiths College , London , for two years before joining Blur .
Since then , he has taken charge of the artwork on his albums and it was he who took the picture of a girl 's bleeding knee on his camera phone that adorns the cover of A&E .
