Some books have been the inspiration for a number of songs .
Black Confederates and Afro Yankees in Civil War Virginia is n't one of them .
However Black Lips singer/guitarist Cole Alexander did base the closing track of the band 's sixth studio album Black Arabia , on the historical tome .
He told Spin magazine : `` I pulled a lot of weird words from the book that I had never heard before , like racist words against white people .
For example , ` bukra . '
I had never heard that before . ''
