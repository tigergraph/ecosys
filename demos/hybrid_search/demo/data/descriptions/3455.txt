This angst-filled number was written by Paramore vocalist Hayley Williams and features on the Megan Fox starring dark comedy Jennifer 's Body .
Williams explained to Spin Magazine that after she penned this , Paramore experienced a difficult period when there was speculation about their future .
This made her anxious about the film 's use of this song .
She explained : `` It 's just something I did for fun .
It actually got picked for the soundtrack a long time ago .
Since that was right in the middle of the strain and tension that our band was going through , I was , like , there 's no way .
Somehow the movie was n't finished yet a year and a half later , and they came back to me about it , and our band was in a completely different situation , feeling great , with a new record to show for it .
So I was , like , why not ? ''
Williams added that she had concerns that doing a solo song would fuel the rumors about Paramore possibly breaking up .
She said : `` The last thing we want is to be putting out a record and have our fans think that one of us has a different focus .
I have no intention of making some solo song that I did on a soundtrack my priority .
Still , I feel really good about it , because this is one thing that I completed by myself and that someone got a hold of and enjoyed . ''
