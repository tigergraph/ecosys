Demi has been estranged from her natural father Patrick Lovato for a long time .
After the Disney star checked into rehab for treatment in the fall of 2010 , Patrick went to the press blaming Hollywood pressures for his daughter 's `` emotional and physical issues . ''
In doing so he created further issues between the pair , and this vulnerable , angry song finds her taking aim at her long-distant dad .
She wails : `` Lie to your flesh and blood/Put your hands on the ones that you swore you loved/So young when the pain had begun/Now forever afraid of being loved . ''
The song was written by Demi with William Beckett of the alternative rock band The Academy Is ... and produced by Toby Gad -LRB- Beyonc√© 's `` If I Were a Boy '' -RRB- .
