This is about the grunge scene that was still in full effect in the early '90s .
It 's about how every band from Seattle thought they had a right to a record deal simply because they went along with what was the hot commodity : `` Well I went to school in Olympia , '' `` Everyone 's the same . ''
-LRB- thanks , Matt - Millbrae , CA -RRB- This was deleted from the album and replaced by an outtake , `` Olympia . ''
Since Kurt Cobain died shortly before the album was released , it was thought that the lines `` So much fun to be Nirvana , how would you like to be Nirvana ?
I 'd rather die '' caused the retraction , but the band and the Geffen label claimed it was pulled because it did not fit the album .
-LRB- thanks , Jacob - Atlanta , GA -RRB-
