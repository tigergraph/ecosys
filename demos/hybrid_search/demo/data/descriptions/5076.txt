A confluence of science fiction and Heavy Metal , this track from the Canadian singer/guitarist Devin Townsend runs 8:10 , and is often a showstopper at his concerts .
`` By Your Command '' is a saying used in the Battlestar Galactica TV series , which ran from 1979-1980 .
It was often uttered by the bad guys when accepting orders from their evil overlords .
Townsend was a big fan of the show , and integrated it into his Ziltoid project , where he creates his own alien character .
`` There 's that sort of outer space thing that seemed to make sense , '' he told us .
`` But really it was a reference back to drugs , and that whole record was a reference to drugs in some sense - that you are unconsciously motivated to go in directions that are either contrary to your nature or maybe not the most accurate representation of where your conscious mind is .
Sort of being on autopilot or being a channel to things that ultimately are going to cause you difficulty .
So ` By Your Command ' had that as an undercurrent , but on the surface it was the introduction to this ridiculous story that the Ziltoid record actually was . ''
