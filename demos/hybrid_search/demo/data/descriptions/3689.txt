Press materials for the album call this a politically motivated track and a `` generational appeal for love , peace and understanding . ''
Frontman Jon Foreman revealed to CCM Magazine that this song `` is a conversation with a well-known law of physics . ''
He added : `` The question is this : If in the physical world things naturally move closer together , why are we falling apart ?
War and rumors of war , divorce , hatred , violence , and everything else on the evening news seems to contradict gravity .
This song is a fun happy-clappy tune about a grave matter : `` Sons of my enemies , why ca n't we seem to keep it together ? ''
This is the theme song to the MTV show Life Of Ryan , which is a reality show about the pro skateboarder Ryan Sheckler .
