In publicity materials for the singer songwriter 's 2009 The Annie Lennox Collection , the Scot referred to this as a `` song of gratitude . ''
Lennox explained : `` I was coming through a dark period , desperately trying to find some joy but not finding it , and trying to remind myself what happiness means .
I was grasping at straws trying to find a reason to be cheerful , and then that song arrived .
There was some beauty after all .
It was like a little mantra , to remind myself to live , breathe , sleep , to try to make your life complete .
Beauty is everywhere ... in a sunrise , a drop of dew , the warm breath of a child , or a flower opening .
That is the sacred gift of life , even if we do n't always acknowledge it . ''
