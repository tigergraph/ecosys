The JaneDear Girls are a Country duo comprising Utah native Susie Brown and Texas born Danelle Leverett .
The follow-up to their debut single `` Wildflower '' was penned by Leverett with Canadian Country music artist Deric Ruttan and finds her recalling an old flame with whom she liked riding shotgun .
`` I was dating this guy a couple of years back , and he wanted to buy a truck , '' she told Taste of Country .
`` He went down to Carl Black Chevrolet and sat in all kinds of different trucks .
Basically I decided that I liked the kind with the bench seat , which apparently is not a popular choice these days .
He had to take a downgrade on a truck to get a bench seat because everyone wants one with bucket seats , because they 're more fancy .
Nobody wants to be that person riding in the middle anymore .
Well , I 'm totally that girl .
I want to ride smack dab in the middle , right next to him .
Comfortably close !
Shotgun !
That 's what I wanted . ''
`` I did ride with him like that for quite a while , until I broke up with him , '' Leverett added .
`` I got a good song out of it , though -LSB- laughs -RSB- !
That 's about it !
And he is stuck with that truck , still . ''
