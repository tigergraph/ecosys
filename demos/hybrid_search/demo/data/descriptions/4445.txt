This old-school Country tune about settling in with a good album and a good wine acts as a love letter to the record .
`` My fans , they 're like me .
They like albums and they read the liner notes , '' Sexsmith explained to Spinner .
`` You hear people say no one cares about albums , but people are buying them .
When I think of my favorite albums , it 's such a personal thing .
You do n't want to be talking over it ; you want to sit down a take it in .
It 's like a book or a movie . ''
Sexsmith told the story of this song to The Guardian : `` My publishers are always sending me on trips to write with other people , so this one time they sent me to Nashville .
You do n't want to turn up empty handed , so in advance I wrote down a load of titles in advance .
But when I played this guy ` Me , Myself and Wine ' he thought I was just making fun of country music , so in the end I just used the song for myself .
It 's pretty simple - it 's just about listening to music with a good glass of wine . ''
