Mike Rosenberg was the founder , main vocalist and songwriter of the four-piece folk rock group Passenger .
After the breakup of the band , Rosenberg kept the Passenger name and took to busking for a solo music career One of the places he frequently played at was Glasgow , Scotland through which the River Clyde flows .
He told VH1 : `` I 've been going there for years .
Playing the street , playing in pubs .
It 's one of those places where you get there first and it 's quite rough in some ways , but the more I went there , the more I loved it .
It 's kind of that juxtaposition of that place -- in some ways , it 's quite bleak and cold , but on the other side of things , it 's got this beating heart to it that 's warm and kind . ''
