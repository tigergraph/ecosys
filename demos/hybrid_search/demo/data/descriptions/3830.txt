Bassist Dave Ellefson discussed this Dave Mustaine-penned one-riff punk rocker with MusicRadar.com : `` I ca n't even tell you how happy I am that we have a song that is made up of one riff .
-LSB- laughs -RSB- That 's not always easy to do .
I know a lot of metal fans do n't like Green Day , but I think they 're masters of the one-riff song .
That 's what we did here , and it works beautifully.It 's so punk rock , the one-riff idea .
The Ramones did it on so many of their songs - maybe all of them .
When I heard Dave play this part , I knew that was all we needed .
The band shifted dynamics in the chorus , Dave played around with the vocal melody ... and it was a song!Many of our tracks are quite complex ; that 's probably something a lot of our fans like about what we do .
The genius of Guns , Drugs & Money , however , is in its simplicity . ''
If the title looks familiar , you might be thinking of the 1978 Warren Zevon song `` Lawyers , Guns and Money . ''
