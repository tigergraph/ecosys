The son of the hit Country songwriter Billy Montana , Randy Montana wrote this song with Tom Douglas , whose credits include `` I Run To You '' by Lady Antebellum and `` The House That Built Me '' by Miranda Lambert .
Randy told us that Tom came up with the line `` love has 1,000 faces , '' and that was their starting point in the song .
From there , they created a long list that formed the basis for the lyrics .
To come up with the list in this song , Randy tried to think about not just every type of girl he 's come across , but also the different things about them that make them unique .
Said Randy , `` You get into what they like , what they do n't like , the ` half-caf , two-pump , no whip in the coffee bean ' type thing .
We were going there with it , because you can start to sound like a sexist pig if you go the other route . ''
