Amerie mapped out the sound of In Love & War before she sat with any producers .
She explained , `` For this album , I told people I needed music that was really heavy , something with knock .
Nothing too pretty ; I wanted something that sounded '70s - ish , when rock had a lot of soul in it , and it was still so related to the blues .
And of course it needed that hip-hop element . ''
This track was produced by American record producer Warryn Campbell .
Amerie said : `` I told Warryn I wanted a live , hard , rock sound , something mean , something with swagger .
I wanted the instrumentation to have a strong personality before I even opened my mouth .
He started playing the bass guitar , and I was sitting there creating the lyrics and melody and it all came together really organically .
That 's what I mean when I say that this album , in addition to being an extension of my first , is also an extension of ' 1 Thing ' because ' 1 Thing ' has its go-go roots but it 's also very soulful , '70s rock .
I went from that and took it all the way live . ''
