Tracy Ackerman , Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins of the songwriting and production team Absolute wrote this specifically for Hicks , who won the American Idol competition in 2006 .
Hicks was an unlikely winner : older than most contestants and somewhat spastic on stage , he barely made it into the round of 12 .
His enthusiasm and spirit won over the judges and viewers , and after winning the competition , this song was crafted to reflect his success story , with lyrics about how gracious he feels in victory .
He performed the song on the Idol season finale .
-LRB- thanks , Donovan Berry - El Dorado , AR -RRB- Weird Al Yankovic did a parody of this song called `` Do I Creep You Out ? ''
It was Yankovic 's first parody of a singer from American Idol .
The Absolute team works with Simon Fuller , who created American Idol .
They have written songs for many artists managed by Fuller , including the Spice Girls and S Club 7 .
This debuted at # 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 then dropped out of the chart completely after 8 weeks , the shortest amount of time a chart-topper has stayed on the American singles chart .
It was also one of the few singles in the 21st century to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100 without any official music video linked to its release .
