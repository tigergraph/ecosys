This down-tempo track finds Ocean singing about a fantasy desire .
The Odd Future affiliate reveals his vulnerability as he acknowledges not knowing all the answers to his problems .
`` What if the stars and skies are a show .
And the aliens are watching live ?
, '' Ocean ponders .
André 3000 picks up the baton with some dryly boastful rhymes about a girl who , `` had the kind of body , that would probably intimidate any of 'em that were un-southern . ''
The Outkast member also plays guitar on the track .
The song contains an audio clip from the 1985 martial arts movie , The Lost Dragon .
Channel Orange was almost entirely produced entirely by Ocean but with help from close friend Malay , a writer/producer who 's also worked with John Legend , Fantasia and Big Boi , among others .
He told Complex magazine how the collaboration came about .
`` It was just a simple thing , '' Malay shared .
`` There came a point when we knew we were getting close to wrapping the record .
Frank was kind of narrowing down who he wanted features from .
We knew we did n't want to make it a record full of a whole bunch of big name collaborators just for the sake of having them .
We were just really trying to decide who we could bring to this project that 's going to elevate the overall project . ''
Ocean wanted Big Boi to also supply a verse for this song but after consulting his OutKast partner André 3000 , he declined .
`` To give away a full OutKast feature on a project that 's not mine or his , is not what we wanted to do right now , '' said Big Boi to Billboard magazine .
`` Ca n't have an OutKast reunion on someone else 's album . ''
