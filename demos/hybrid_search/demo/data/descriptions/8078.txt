On this breezy driving track from American singer-songwriter Norah Jones ' fourth album , The Fall , she sings of love gone wrong .
The song features Jones singing surprisingly graphic lyrics with references to gunning down werewolves and arson .
Toben Seymour , a director and puppeteer who has also worked with Moby , will.i.am , and Kanye West , helmed the song 's music video .
