Since divorcing in 1993 from her third husband - the English songwriter and musician Paul Kennerley - Emmylou Harris remained unmarried .
At the time of the recording of her 2011 album , Hard Bargain , the country-folk singer was living with her older brother Walter and her mother Eugenia .
The record finds Harris offering two different takes on the single life , whilst the subject of `` Nobody '' finds herself ready to face , and embrace , the world on her own , `` Lonely Girl '' is about a woman still yearning for someone else even at the end of her life .
Harris told Spinner UK the song does n't necessarily mean that she feels lonely herself : `` I have a wonderful life filled with family , friends , dogs and children , but I 'm not in a relationship , '' she said .
`` I mean , I have so many relationships , but not the type that people feel you need to complete yourself .
I do n't hold to that .
We all feel that something is missing , when there probably is n't .
I got the melody and started reflecting , but it was n't like I wanted to tell the world : ` Feel sorry for me , I 'm lonely . ' ''
The song began as a melody without words , when Harris was sketching out songs in her Nashville home months before she went into the studio .
She explained that it , `` started with me noodling around in that open tuning .
It kind of wrote itself .
Having the melody carried me to the end . ''
Emmylou penned the tune , and the other songs on Hard Bargain , in her writing room in her home in Nashville .
`` For some reason I felt very comfortable in here , like a little nest or something up in the trees , you know ? ''
she told Associated Press writer Chris Talbott .
`` I just said , ` Well , I need to try to write , ' so I just literally locked myself away like the character in ` Rumpelstiltskin : ' ` Do n't come out of there till you spin all that straw into gold ! '
So I got a big bunch of straw . ''
