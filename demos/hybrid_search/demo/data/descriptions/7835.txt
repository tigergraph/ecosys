Panic at the Disco began recording material for their third studio album , Vices & Virtues in spring 2009 .
However , on July 6 , 2009 , Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced via the band 's official website that they were exiting the band leaving singer/multi-instrumentalist Brendon Urie and drummer Spencer Smith to continue as a duo .
This track originated as an idea that the quartet came up with before they broke up .
`` That 's the only idea we had from before we split , '' Smith told AOL .
`` All we had was the music , and we could never figure out what to do with it .
We loved it as a guitar and drum line , but we were able to figure it out , write a chorus for it and turn it into a song that I really love .
We actually have a kids choir singing at the end of it , so that 's just one song I 'm totally proud of . ''
