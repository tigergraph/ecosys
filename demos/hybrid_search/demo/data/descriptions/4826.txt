In this song , Nick Lowe is acknowledging the unpredictability -LRB- and , sometimes , futility -RRB- of life and the inevitability of death .
`` So it goes '' is a recurring line in Kurt Vonnegut 's 1969 novel , The Slaughterhouse Five .
It is used every time a death occurs .
This features in the 1979 musical comedy , Rock 'n' Roll High School , starring The Ramones .
Jesus of Cool was Lowe 's debut solo album .
So to not cause offense , the American release was re-titled Pure Pop for Now People .
The iconic album cover features six images of Lowe dressed in a variety of exaggerated rock star costumes .
This was Lowe 's first solo single following the split of the pub rock band , Brinsley Schwarz .
It was also the first single to be released on Stiff Records , a label formed by the music managers , Dave Robinson and Andrew Jakeman , using a # 400 -LRB- $ 645 -RRB- loan from Dr. Feelgood front man , Lee Brilleaux .
Stiff Records paid Lowe # 45 -LRB- $ 73 -RRB- to record two songs with The Rumour drummer , Steve Goulding .
The result was this song and its b-side , `` Heart of the City . ''
Although `` So It Goes '' failed to chart , it still earned a profit for the young Stiff Records .
Lowe told KLRU that Steely Dan influenced this song : `` It 's not my favourite , it 's a bit too much like Steely Dan .
I think I must have got it from something they 'd done . ''
