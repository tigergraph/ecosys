Clyne : `` I was very conflicted .
The time that this record was written was in the shadow of a war and then during a war .
I know how I feel about war and how a lot of people feel about war , and it was hard to say if it was either just or unjust .
As an artist , I had to report .
These are tough times to make a call .
If anybody wants to say I 'm vacillating , they 're welcome to , but these are times when black and white often collide and coalesce and right and wrong are not easy to pick apart .
I think you can hear a lot of confusion in the record . ''
At the insistence of his manager , the band recorded and released the song in March 2003 as the United States prepared for war .
`` I had the song , but I was n't planning on putting it out , '' Clyne says .
`` Our manager , Peter Lubin , said , `` If you have any backbone as an artist , you 'll put it out now and take a stand with the way you feel .
God bless him for making me do that and we did .
We recorded it and put it out the day after as a free download on the Web site .
We pressed singles for radio , but the climate in America was so volatile and so polarized about the war that no radio station would touch it .
It got shunned all the way around . ''
