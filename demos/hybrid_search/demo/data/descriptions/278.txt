A track from the breakout debut album by The Jeff Healey Band , `` River of No Return '' has lyrics by Keith Reid , who as a member of Procol Harum , wrote the words to `` A Whiter Shade Of Pale '' and all the other songs for the group .
Reid had the lyrics written , but did n't find music to go with them until his publicist paired him with Jon Tiven , a former music journalist who had written and produced songs for Rick Derringer , Mick Farren and Jim Carroll .
Tiven had never written just the music for a song , but jumped at the chance to work with Reid .
He told us the story : `` Keith came over my house , and said , ` Play me some music . '
So I played him some music .
He said , ` No .
Play me some more music . '
I played him some more .
` Nah . '
Then I finally played him something that he liked , and he went to get a briefcase .
He pulled out a typed sheet of paper .
He said , ' I did this as a translation of a French lyric .
It was n't a translation , it was just something that fit into the same phrasing as the French lyric , but it was rejected .
So I think this will fit with that music that you had . '
So we tried it , and took all of 15 minutes to get the thing together .
It fit perfectly except for one line .
And the song was called ` River of No Return . '
Went on the first Jeff Healey record and sold about three million copies.So at that point I said , ` Oh , words and music .
Keeping them separate .
That might be a good thing . ' ''
