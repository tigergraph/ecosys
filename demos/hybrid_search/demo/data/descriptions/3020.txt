This energy-packed anthem by the three Burnham brothers was produced by Ryan Tedder , whose other credits include Leona Lewis ' `` Bleeding Love , '' Beyonc√© 's `` Halo '' and his own band OneRepublic 's `` Secrets . ''
The oldest Burnham , Alex , told MTV News about the song : `` It 's really fun .
It 's about your girlfriend -LSB- breaking up with -RSB- you and then all of a sudden she wants you back .
And you 're like , ` No , you just dumped me !
I 'm still mad at you .
So , catch me if you can . '
It 's that kind of vibe and it 's all fun and stuff , but it translates really well to a song . ''
