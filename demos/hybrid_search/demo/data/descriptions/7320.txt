This song describes a night that Mando Diao lead singers Björn Dixgård and Gustaf Norén had in Amsterdam on drugs .
Norén said of the experience in an interview to promote the album , `` It 's not for children , not even for adults .
It 's a very frightening story , but it 's all there on the album .
I do n't want to give out any details .
It was the best night and the worst night of my life . ''
