This Amy Winehouse composition was recorded in London in May 2008 for potential inclusion on her third album .
Tragically the English songstress passed away before the LP was completed , but it was included on her postosthumous long player , Lioness : Hidden Treasures .
According to frequent Winehouse cohort Salaam Remi , who produced the song , the track 's heavy doo wop influence , `` shows one of the main directions in which she was heading . ''
Remi said to NME regarding the song 's meaning : `` She was talking about a relationship , what went on between the cheaters .
It was her classic wordplay to link it back to between the sheets . ''
Speaking with Billboard magazine , Remi explained that Winehouse came to him after a much-publicized opportunity to record the theme for the James Bond movie Quantum of Solace fell apart .
`` She was a bit upset , '' by the whole episode and told Remi she had this new song `` with the lyrics written down . ''
He continued : `` She picked up a guitar and gave me her first chord .
I asked what she wanted it to sound like and she said , ` doo wop . '
I said give me 20 minutes .
Amy took her time writing her lyrics .
They meant everything to her ; she was single at the time .
It was one take . ''
