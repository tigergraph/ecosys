This instrumental piece is the original soundtrack to the movie Memento .
There also is an extended version .
This song illustrates Colin Greenwood 's wish to create an album that is neither too long nor too boring album to listen to .
Admittedly , lots of people tend to zap this song , considering it useless on the album .
Actually , it keeps separated two parts of the album ; it acts as a pause , much in the same way as on the old LPs where it was necessary to turn the vinyl .
For 4 minutes 47 seconds , nothing much happens , simply some music coming from an instrument that it difficult to identify -LRB- some people think that Treefingers is a guitar instrumental -RRB- , making us wait for the second part of the album which starts abruptly with `` Optimistic . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France , for above 2 -RRB-
