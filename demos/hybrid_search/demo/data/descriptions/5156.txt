This song was originally the title track of an unreleased Green Day album dating back to 2003 .
Just weeks before the record was completed , the master recordings of 20 tracks were stolen from the studio .
Instead of re-recording the album , the band decided to start from scratch , leading to the creation of American Idiot .
Green Day later referred to the incident as a blessing in disguise .
The track was first played live at Green Day 's concert in Greenwood Village , Colorado at the Comfort Dental Amphitheatre on August 28 , 2010 , while on their 21st Century Breakdown World Tour .
Two days later they played it again at their Phoenix , Arizona concert and this version was recorded and featured on their 2011 live album , Awesome as F -- k.
