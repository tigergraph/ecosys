Usher 's father , Usher Raymond III , left the family when Usher was a year old , and he was brought up by his mother , and later his stepfather .
On this song he sings about his dad 's promiscuous ways and the consequences of growing up without his male birth parent .
Usher had planned to collaborate with Amy Winehouse but the project was thwarted by the singer 's death in July 2011 .
However , he still managed to hit the studio with her longtime producer , Salaam Remi , on this song .
He explained to MTV UK : `` You know working with Salaam Remi kind of came as a product of wanting to explore and try different things .
I had been speaking with Amy Winehouse loosely about us working together and of course I knew Salaam Remi would probably be the best producer to do it because I felt like he would understand both of us and he had such success with her.I had conversations with my A&R , Mark Pitts about us working together , '' he continued .
`` Shortly after , unfortunately , we lost Amy Winehouse but it was still an opportunity for us to work together .
So we got in and we worked on an incredible record called Sins Of My Father . ''
Usher Raymond III died of a heart attack in 2008 .
Usher told UK newspaper The Sun : `` Sins Of My Father touches on different generations and the curses they must deal with and wanting to break it to change the course , so that my kids wo n't have to deal with it .
It 's a bit deep .
`` You never truly understand the perspective of anything until you have children yourself , '' he continued .
`` You realise that everything you do affects them .
I was not raised with my father , so it was tough but I did reconcile before his death , which gave me great comfort .
He had troubles but took responsibility for his actions . ''
