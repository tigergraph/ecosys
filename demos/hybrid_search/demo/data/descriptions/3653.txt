Charli XCX 's debut album True Romance has been in the making since early 2010 .
This was an important song in giving the album its direction as it was the first one she penned with producer Ariel Rechtshaid .
She explained to The Sun : `` I wrote ` Stay Away ' at the end of a pretty unsuccessful writing trip to LA a few years ago and I had two hours before I had to leave for the airport.Ariel and I met and we wrote ` Stay Away ' together in that time .
It was like magic .
Ariel was very important in making this record .
He has such a brilliant ear and great taste . ''
