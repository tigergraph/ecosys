There have been a few songs about lighthouses but probably none about lighthouse keepers ' wives , or aspiring wives of same .
As the last UK lighthouse was automated in 1998 , the lady who wrote this song will have to continue to aspire .
The lady concerned is Erika Eigen , who was a member of the short lived psychedelic folk band Sunforest .
Little is known about her , but on August 6 , 2008 she turned up in Battersea , South London , where she performed it ad hoc with American guitarist Fred Sokolow .
`` I Want To Marry A Lighthouse Keeper '' or simply `` Lighthouse Keeper '' was used in the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange .
