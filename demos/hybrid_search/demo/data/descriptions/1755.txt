Toby Keith described this track as `` a classic country radio song '' in publicity materials .
He explained : `` It 's old-fashioned .
I guess I get it from listening to The Roadhouse so much on XM Sirius Radio in my vehicles .
But the song is very simply written , a very classic melody .
Guys , hey it 's ` just another sundown , just another bar stool , just another place where a fool can find another fool , ' sad night in the world , sad night in the club . ''
