The theme of So Beautiful Or So What is the meaning of life , and Simon asks the question on this track : if humanity suddenly disappeared , `` would a zebra gazing in the African Savannah care enough to shed one zebra tear '' ?
He said to Mojo : `` I imagine two zebras saying , ` Bummer !
Those humans have gone . '
` Yeah what a drag ! ''
Simon penned the ballads for So Beautiful Or So What before working on the more up tempo songs .
He explained why in an interview with Spinner : '' ` Amulet , ' ` Love and Hard Times ' and ` Questions for the Angels ' were the first three songs written .
Maybe that 's part of its strength - that I spent a lot of time on the ballads .
I was interested in beginning from another premise than rhythm .
When you start with the rhythm , if you get a really good groove going , you 're perfectly happy to play one chord or just a few chords and just repeat it , like on ` Christmas Day ' or ` The Afterlife ' or ` So Beautiful Or So What . '
That 's just the same pattern repeated , but they had good grooves and you do n't need to get into a lot of changes on rhythm . ''
