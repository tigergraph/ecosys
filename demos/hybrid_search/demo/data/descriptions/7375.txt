Guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz told Kerrang !
magazine : '' ` The Hell In Me ' was one of the songs where I wrote all the music and brought it to the guys .
They all liked it , so Jesse -LRB- Leach , vocalist -RRB- and I got together in the studio and pierced together the lyrics . ''
He added regarding the song 's meaning : `` It 's pretty much about internal struggles and fighting the things that bring you down . '' '
