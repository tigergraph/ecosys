`` The most crucial thing for me is that I want it to be real . ''
That 's what Mellencamp told Creem magazine in 1987 .
Two years later , he released a song about it .
In `` Pop Singer , '' he explains that the music is what is important to him , and that he has no use for the gladhanding , trend-following or fan interaction that is expected of Pop Stars .
Mellencamp was n't always so `` real '' - his manager had him use the stage name `` Johnny Cougar , '' which took him years to reverse .
He soon took control of his career , however , and did things on his terms .
Any part of the job that is n't related to making or performing music is something Mellencamp avoids .
He will begrudgingly do promotion , but refuses corporate music traditions like radio station concerts and meet-and-greets .
This stance did n't endear him to industry types , but many fans found his candor refreshing and appreciated his authenticity and devotion to his craft .
When he wrote this song , Mellencamp was going through a divorce with his second wife , Victoria Granucci .
`` I was questioning the importance of music , '' he told Rolling Stone .
`` Everybody was having to kiss everybody 's ass .
If you want to be on MTV , then come here and do this .
All these backroom deals were getting made .
I was like , ' I do n't want any part of this . ' ''
