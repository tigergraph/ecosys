Hombre Lobo is a concept album about a werewolf who experiences various types of desire and in this song he expresses his frustration with the line `` Birds do it / Bees do it / I wan na do it . ''
The Sun June 5 , 2009 asked Eels mainman Mark Oliver Everett how much of this is his character and how much himself ?
He replied : `` I think I 'm writing purely in character , but I find that when I look back , I suddenly realize , ` Oh that was exactly what I was going through personally at the time . '
I described the album concept to a friend of mine as basically 12 songs from the point of view of a horny old werewolf .
She said , ` Oh well , it 's your most honest album to date . ' ''
