Michael Kiwanuka is a British musician of Ugandan heritage who writes songs combining soul and rootsy folk influences and sings them with a deep , husky soulful voice .
After signing with Communion Records , Kiwanuka recorded his debut EP , Tell Me A Tale with the help of Paul Butler from the Bees , who took the Muswell Hill , London native to his Isle of Wight studio to record the songs .
The record came to the attention of Adele who invited Kiwanuka to support her on the singing star 's 2011 European tour .
The BBC announced on January 6 , 2012 that Kiwanuka had won their Sound of 2012 poll , an annual survey of music critics and industry figures to find the most promising new music talent .
Kiwanuka told Q this was one of the easier tracks on the album to write .
He said : `` It just flowed out in the space of about 20 minutes .
I had this little acoustic guitar riff and thought it sounded quite nice .
Songs are not all that easy , trust me !
It was pure expression , which is why I wanted to call the album Home Again . ''
This poignantly melancholic ballad is the title track and lead single from Kiwanuka 's debut album .
He explained the song 's meaning to Q magazine : `` It 's about comfort and peace .
Home is where you 're most yourself - you do n't have many inhibitions , you just feel free to be who you are .
The song is about getting back to that place - not literally a house or place but just that feeling , you know ?
That feeling that let 's you do the things you want to do and you say the things you want to say . ''
