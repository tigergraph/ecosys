Valleys of Neptune is a collection of 12 tracks that never saw proper official release .
They include the final studio sessions of the original Jimi Hendrix Experience line-up and Hendrix 's first recordings with bassist Billy Cox , an old army buddy he 'd recruited into his new ensemble , both in 1969 .
A number of the songs were recorded for what was originally supposed to be the follow-up to 1968 's Electric Ladyland .
There are also alternative versions of `` Fire '' and `` Red House '' plus an instrumental cover of Cream 's `` Sunshine Of Your Love '' and a version of Elmore James 's `` Bleeding Heart .
`` The title track , released as a single prior to the album 's release on Mar. 9th 2010 , remained uncovered for nearly four decades since Hendrix recorded it at New York 's Record Plant in May 1970 .
The version we hear on Valleys of Neptune features Billy Cox rather than Noel Redding on bass .
McDermott explained : `` Jimi had tried to develop the song with the original Experience , but nothing came about as far as a finished recording .
It really evolved over time ; and yes , at which point it was becoming a fully realized song he was comfortable playing with Billy . ''
-LRB- Redding left The Jimi Hendrix Experience following a show on June 26 , 1969 in Denver , Colorado , at which point Hendrix began to form a new band to continue work on his new compositions . -RRB-
Valleys of Neptune debuted at # 4 on the Billboard 200 , making it Hendrix 's highest-charting album since The Cry of Love reached # 3 in 1971 .
John McDermott , a co-producer of Valleys of Neptune , told Musicradar.com that this track had a long gestation period , which was not unusual for Hendrix .
He explained : `` With Jimi , his approach was ` refine , refine , refine ' - whether it was in the studio or at home in his apartment , that 's what he did.He was a perfectionist .
That 's what fueled his whole energy .
Even when you listen to `` Ships Passing Through The Night , '' he would go back and expand that into `` Night Bird Flying . ''
`` Lullaby For The Summer '' became `` Ezy Ryder . ''
That was just his way.For an artist as talented as he was , he was never satisfied .
He did n't make changes just to make changes ; every time he did something different to a song , it would improve .
He was a real craftsman . ''
Producer/engineer Eddie Kramer married a demo of this song Hendrix recorded in a hotel room with a band version from almost a year later for Valleys of Neptune .
Kramer said to Toronto 's The Globe and Mail March 5 , 2010 referring to the cutting-and-pasting : `` That 's the sort of thing Jimi would have done , which is one of the reasons I had no qualms about doing it . ''
The front cover of the album is of a photo of Jimi Hendrix taken by Linda McCartney , superimposed over a painting by Jimi .
