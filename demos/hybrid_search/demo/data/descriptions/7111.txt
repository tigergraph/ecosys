This song tells the true story of Wenseslao Moguel , a soldier in the Mexican Revolution , who was captured and sentenced to death by a firing squad without a trial .
Moguel was shot 9 times including a final bullet through his head at close range by an officer to ensure death .
But somehow he survived and managed to escape .
After his `` execution '' he went on to live a full life and spent much of it touring the USA with the `` Ripley 's Believe It Or Not '' traveling museum .
