Fiasco was raised as a Muslim and his tracks often are critical of the Hip-Hop scene for its chronic lack of morality .
This song finds him observing how much he could improve his prospects for commercial success by pandering to the lowest common denominator of gangsta-rap stereotypes .
He explained to the San Diego Union-Tribune January 10 , 2008 : '' ` Dumb It Down ' looks at how musical entertainment as a whole is used as a distraction , as a tool , to keep people dumb , instead of focusing on real issues and solutions .
Most definitely , I rap about issues like this for a reason .
I do n't just do it to do it ; I present it in as unbiased a way as possible , so that people know it exists .
You ca n't expect people to act if they do n't know it exists .
Situations that are sad and uncomfortable take a long time to address , especially when you are living in a culture of instant gratification . ''
Fiasco further elaborated about this track in an interview with Orange UK : `` The chatter that goes behind the scenes , either in the music business or the -LSB- hip-hop -RSB- community or whatever , they 'll be like , ` Yeah he does n't represent the streets , ' or ` He 's too soft ' or ` He 's too lyrical ' or ` He needs to make music that the common man can understand . '
There 's a lot of people that understand my music , I just took a shot back at the people who are always like ` You 're not winning awards , you got ta make music like this . '
I 'm like ` Nah , I like making music like this .
I do n't need to dumb it down . ' ''
