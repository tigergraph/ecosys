Vocalist Oli Sykes told Metal Hammer magazine this song started off with some lighthearted lyrics .
He explained : `` I came downstairs one morning and said to Jordan -LRB- Fish , keyboards -RRB- .
` I 've just come up with the most nu metal mosher lyrics of all time ! '
Ha ha ha !
He was like , ` What are you talking about ? '
, so I went , ` Middle fingers up , if you do n't give a f -- k ! '
, and we both laughed .
It was almost a joke , like we were never gon na do it , but as we wrote it I started to find the lyrics to not make it cheesy . ''
Sykes explained the song 's meaning to Metal Hammer : `` It 's about ` Slacktivists , ' online people that just talk s -- t on Twitter , and ` Like this if you want to get Obama to die ' or whatever .
It 's loads of s -- t ; people think they 're making a difference nowadays just because they 're sat on their fat arses with ill-informed ` facts . '
They think they know everything and that they 're making a difference , and it 's bulls -- t. `` So the lyrics to this one are quite sarcastic , '' he added , `` but if you want to make a difference , you have to do more than just sit at your computer .
It 's not saying ` Do n't care about the world ' , it 's saying , ` Do n't think you care about the world and that you 're better than people if you 're doing f -- k all ' .
If you really believe in all that , you 've got to get up and do more . ''
