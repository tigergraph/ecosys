The title , FFL , stands for `` Fat F -- king Lie . ''
The musical style of this song is not typical of the Foo Fighters , and is more along the lines of Dave Grohl 's metal roots .
-LRB- thanks , Bert - Pueblo , NM , for above 3 -RRB- During the song , Dave Grohl screams `` Get on your bikes and ride ! ''
This is reference to one of his favorite bands , Queen .
In the Queen song `` Fat Bottomed Girls , '' Freddie Mercury yells out the same line , which is actually a reference back to Queen 's `` Bicycle Race . ''
