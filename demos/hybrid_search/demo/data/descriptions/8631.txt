In an interview for American Online -LRB- AOL -RRB- , Trisha Yearwood was asked if there was one song from Heaven , Heartache , and the Power of Love , which she was particularly proud of .
The Country superstar replied : `` Well , I could go through the whole album and tell you why I love each one , because I think it 's my favorite collection of songs that I 've ever done .
My sentimental favorite , though , is the last cut , ` Sing You Back to Me , ' because it immediately made me think of my father .
This is the first record I 've made since he passed away .
We were very close , and when I heard that song , I thought , ` This is for my dad . '
And I was n't looking for a song to dedicate to my father , but when I heard this song , I thought , ` Wow , I really want to sing this , even if it 's just for me to have myself . '
So we went in after the record was done with just an acoustic guitar and did a performance of this song just for me to have , to give to my mom and my sister .
And my producer , Garth Fundis , said , ` It 's emotional and it 's real , and you need to put it on the record . ' ''
In the same interview Trisha Yearwood was asked how she 'd describe Heaven , Heartache , and the Power of Love : `` Energy , energy , energy !
I 'm sort of known for ballads - those are my bread and butter .
But there were just so many cool , uptempo songs that showed up for this record .
And some of it was the enthusiasm that transferred into the studio .
A lot of that came from changing things up , signing with a new label - there 's a lot of energy there .
It just seems like this record was meant to be .
So maybe those are my 3 words : ` meant to be . '
Because when I listen back now , I hear how much fun I was having during the process . ''
