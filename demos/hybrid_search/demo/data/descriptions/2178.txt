Spektor has a broad vocal range and is known for the many unorthodox vocal techniques she uses on her songs .
On this one , she purses her lips together to fake a trumpet part .
`` When I wrote it , in my mind it was just a placeholder for a real trumpet , '' she explained to the New York edition of The Metro .
`` First of all , it 's really fun to do ; it 's a fun feeling , like even walking around the house being a trumpet .
If you bring things from their implied state to a real state , sometimes it becomes better and sometimes , I do n't know ... you try to feel what 's right for the song . ''
