He told MTV News that the song 's title does n't mean he 's about to retire from the music game .
`` It was meant not just for the album , but really just looking back at life , '' Bun said .
`` Like , you never know how long you 're gon na be here .
I plan on being here for a long while , but I do n't have a final say on that sh -- .
So with that being said , to sum up everything up to this point , we had some ups and some downs , we had some real rough times .
But we 're still here , and I do n't think I would really change anything at this point , because it really has been a pleasure doing what I do and being out there with the people .
I just wan na continue with it .
I ai n't done with it .
But in case I do n't get to say anything else beyond this point , I just wan na let the people know it 's been a pleasure . ''
