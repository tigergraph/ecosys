Both Michelle and Barack Obama are huge fans of Stevie Wonder and the couple used this tune as their wedding song .
As Barack Obama presented Wonder with the nation 's highest award for pop music , the Library of Congress ' Gershwin Prize for Popular Song , he joked that he might not even have got married without Stevie .
The President quipped : `` I think it 's fair to say that had I not been a Stevie Wonder fan , Michelle might not have dated me , we might not have married .
The fact that we agreed on Stevie was part of the essence of our courtship . ''
George Michael recorded a cover of this song in April 2011 as a wedding gift for Prince William and Kate Middleton .
Michael , who was a friend of with Prince William 's late mother Princess Diana , recalled on Piers Morgan 's CNN show how it all came about : `` The idea came to me last week ... that I should perhaps kinda express my happiness at this marriage , in a way , publicly .
It was an April day that happened to be like summer here in London and I was twittering and kinda got carried away and decided I was gon na make them -LSB- William and Kate -RSB- a new track ... by Friday , so I 've had a very busy week .
`` He added : `` When I was a child I dreamt of singing this song in my imagination ... I used to dream of singing it in the school assembly hall , but I guess this is a slightly bigger deal than that . ''
Obama first revealed his love for Stevie Wonder 's music during an interview with the June 2008 edition of Rolling Stone .
He said : `` If I had one musical hero , it would have to be Stevie Wonder .
When I was at that point where you start getting involved in music , Stevie had that run with Music of My Mind , Talking Book , Fulfillingness ' First Finale and Innervisions , and then Songs in the Key of Life .
Those are as brilliant a set of five albums as we 've ever seen . ''
