La Roux are singer Elly Jackson and her studio partner Ben Langmaid .
Jackson started off writing songs with an acoustic guitar , before switching to the synthesiser .
This song about the heartache of love gone wrong is the only one on La Roux that she retained from her acoustic days .
The singer told Troubled Diva that it `` was the first song me and Ben ever wrote together on guitar . ''
Jackson told Troubled Diva that despite this change in style , the pair have n't changed the way they write songs .
Said Jackson : `` We do n't write on guitar anymore , but we still go through the same process .
You get four or five chords that you really like , and then you start humming over them .
And you find some lyrics , and find a melody , and go from there really .
So it 's the same process , but on a different instrument . ''
