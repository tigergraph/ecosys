Zakk Wylde wrote this song a few months before his good friend , Darrell `` Dimebag '' Abbott , was shot and killed by a deranged fan named Nathan Gale when Abbott was performing with his band Damage Plan .
Wylde subsequently dedicated the song to Abbott ; a fitting tribute as the song deals with death .
In our interview with Zakk Wylde , he said that Abbott was one of his favorite songwriters and guitarists .
`` I always tell everybody what Dime 's legacy is , '' he said .
`` Tony Iommi created that whole genre of music , then Dime and the guys took the Sabbath thing and added gasoline .
He added nitrous to it and created his own new thing . ''
In the 2004 Guitar World readers ' poll , Abbott was named `` Most Valuable Metal Guitarist , '' with Wylde coming in second .
After the death of Dimebag Darrell , Zakk Wylde commissioned a video for this song in tribute to his fallen friend .
Directed by Eric Zimmerman , the video shows Dime and Zakk as children , with both of them going into a river , but only Wylde coming out .
Footage of Dimebag performing was also incorporated into the clip .
