Incubus frontman Brandon Boyd and guitarist Mike Einziger visited the Oxford Union of UK 's Oxford University on March 3 , 2010 where they spoke and played some songs .
This tune was written prior to the visit and the pair decided to play it for the students .
It was the first song penned for If Not Now , When .
Lyrically the song specifically references a quote from American Philosopher Ken Wilbur 's A Brief History Of Everything , `` No epoch is finally privileged .
We are all tomorrow 's food .
The process continues .
And spirit is found in the process itself , not in any particular epoch , or time , or place . ''
Boyd explained on the band 's official website : `` No one had ever put so succinctly and eloquently into words how I felt about growing up .
About reaching my mid-thirties .
After reading this quote , and witnessing the vast push and pull at play between the old and the new , the young and the not so young , I saw the inherent beauty and wisdom in the process of it all .
And consequently , wrote a song about it . ''
Guitarist Mike Einziger told Rock Sound magazine : `` I love that song .
It 's a little representation of our song-writing relationship ; sometimes I write things that I think he 's going to like but he does n't , and then it happens the other way around .
So many of our songs have come from little nuggets of music that I 've written but thought that Brandon would n't like , but he 's taken them and interpreted them in his own way .
This song is an example of that .
I do n't think ` Tomorrow 's Food ' sounds like anything else we 've ever written .
But that 's a good thing . ''
