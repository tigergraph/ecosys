The Scoop DeVille-produced song features rapper Young Jeezy and contains a short sample of Soul II Soul 's `` Back to Life -LRB- However Do You Want Me -RRB- . ''
Jeezy originally agreed to get on a different track called `` Dope Boys '' for Joe , but when he got to the studio , DJ Khaled kept raving about this cut , so The Snowman asked to hear it .
`` He played it for me one time , '' Jeezy , told MTV News .
`` We was sitting there , vibing on the verses .
I went in there and knocked out the hook . ''
`` He knocked that hook out quick , '' Joe added .
`` I told him we were using that ` Slow down , son , you 're killin ' 'em , ' then he started with that ` We came in this bi -- tonight to murder things .
And we gon na leave this bi -- tonight a murder scene . ' ''
