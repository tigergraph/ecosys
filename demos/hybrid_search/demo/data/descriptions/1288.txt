Singer Mark Hall explained in the liner notes of Wow Hits 2008 : `` This song came out of a relationship that we formed with a family early on .
Their young daughter , Erin , was battling cancerous tumors all throughout her lungs .
Her mother began including us in emails that she was writing to her group of supporters .
They were constantly going back and forth to doctors and hospitals for treatments .
I still have most of them .
The journey this mom went through was just amazing .
There 's no way I 'll ever be able to understand what she was going through .
These emails described the journey of her faith and what her worship would look like .
One day it was , ` We 're going to be okay .
We have faith God is going to do this . '
And then another would be like , ` What is the deal ?
Is he even here ? '
She passed away earlier this year .
We decided to subtitle the song ` Erin 's Song ' in her honor . ''
