This was originally written by Pete Townshend for his aborted Lifehouse project , which was intended to be a Rock Opera similar to The Who 's Tommy and Quadrophenia .
Many of the songs Townshend wrote for Lifehouse ended up on the 1971 Who 's Next album .
`` Let 's See Action '' was recorded for the album , but did n't make the cut .
Instead , it was released as a single in the fall of 1971 in the UK peaking at # 16 .
In the US it remained unreleased until its inclusion on the Hooligans compilation album in 1981 .
Roger Daltrey recalled to Uncut magazine October 2001 : `` Pete was going through a terrible bitterness about the fact that Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp had n't got behind making Lifehouse as a film .
But the reason they did n't get behind it was because they could n't get to grips with the narrative , and I still feel to this day -- even though Pete 's done his Lifehouse Chronicles box and done it as a radio play -- well , I 'm sorry but though there 's some incredible music in there and some sparks of theoretical and theological ideas , I think the narrative thread of the story is about as exciting as a f -- ing whelk race !
But I always liked ` Let 's See Action . '
It 's got that texture of explosive rock 'n' roll bits mixed in with a laid-back , almost country feel .
I still love the sentiment behind it , too . ''
