Elvis Presley originally recorded this in 1961 .
UB40 were asked to record an Elvis tune of their choice for a new film called Honeymoon In Vegas .
The band 's drummer , James Brown , suggested they record this song because it was one of his favorites .
The band agreed but when they presented the song to the film director Andrew Bergman , they learned that a few other acts had recorded the same song , with Clarence Giddons and Bruno Hernandez 's version making it into the film , whilst Bono 's version ended up on the soundtrack album , even though it was n't in the film .
However it was included on the soundtrack for the movie Sliver , starring Sharon Stone and William Baldwin .
Guitarist Robin Campbell admitted in 1000 UK # 1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh : `` We were n't all that happy with the finished version .
But we thought it might have been used in Honeymoon In Vegas .
We were going to scrap it because we were working on our new album Promises and Lies at the time and we were determined not to put any cover versions on it . ''
Most of the band were against including the track on the album because , as Robin said , `` They thought it was n't representative of the album , but I persuaded them that it would be pointless not to , as it was likely to be a smash hit . ''
UB40 's only other US # 1 , `` Red Red Wine , '' was also a cover .
It was originally recorded by Neil Diamond .
This was UB40 's biggest hit .
It was # 1 in the US for 7 weeks .
Like ZZ Top and the Irish band U2 , UB40 has managed to maintain a steady lineup for 30 years .
While they did use session musicians and certain members pursued solo careers , the band really never had to replace any members at all .
