In this acoustic-based song set in Britain on the brink of the Second World War , Doherty pays tribute to his beloved grandmother .
He explained to The Sun March 13 , 2009 : `` It 's my nanna .
She was evacuated in the war and went out west .
Three or four years ago , the council shipped her out west again to sheltered accommodation .
I always said to her , ` When I make it , I 'll get you a big house in the country ' but she 's so proud .
She would n't take anything from me . ''
Doherty originally recorded this song as a duet with Amy Winehouse on his mobile phone , ahead of a recording session .
He told the NME March 21 , 2009 , that the producer Stephen Street `` did n't want to go for it . ''
The former Libertine added : `` Amy was up for it , but we probably could n't have afforded it anyway . ''
