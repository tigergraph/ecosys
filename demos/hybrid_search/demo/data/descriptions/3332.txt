This song is about Paul McCartney 's schooldays .
He told the Mail on Sunday May 12 , 2008 about it : `` Because of the retrospective mood of this medley , it then goes back to school and teachers .
I had a real motley bunch of teachers at the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys .
Some of them were complete maniacs .
Whereas I wrote about golden summers in ` You Tell Me , ' school was very dark and gloomy .
The building itself was n't the lightest of places - it was built in 1825 .
This seemed to affect the attitude of the teachers .
They were a dark bunch of people .
So the song is like a therapy session for me . ''
