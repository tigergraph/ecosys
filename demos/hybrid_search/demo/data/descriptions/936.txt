Written by Soundgarden bass player Hiro Yamamoto , 665 is one away from 666 , the sign of the devil .
The song parodies all those Heavy Metal songs that supposedly include hidden -LRB- or not-so-hidden -RRB- satanic messages .
Soundgarden has said that the association between black magic and Rock is ridiculous .
When played in reverse , lead singer Chris Cornell can be heard singing , `` I need you Santa baby . ''
This is a play on the supposed backward masking found in songs like `` Stairway To Heaven . ''
