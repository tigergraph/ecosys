The term soy-bomb first made the headlines when performance artist Michael Portnoy was hired to stand in the background with other dancers and bob his head to the music while Bob Dylan performed `` Love Sick '' at the 1998 Grammy Awards .
Halfway through the performance , Portnoy ripped off his shirt to reveal the words `` Soy Bomb '' emblazoned on his chest .
Dylan tried to ignore the intruder and carried on until Portnoy was escorted from the stage .
When questioned by reporters , the performance artist explained that ` Soy-Bomb ' meant `` a spontaneous explosion of the self to re-invigorate the currently bland music scene that exists . ''
