I say , ' I do n't want to feel sober , I want to feel numb , I do n't want to feel sober . '
So with most people are n't going through they say they drink and get high and that is kind of what the story is about .
Man it feels like I 'm floating on the clouds .
I 'm high , because I do n't want to face the world alone .
Because when you are going through these things you want to ease your pain .
You do n't want to think about what is making you hurt , that is what the record is about . ''
