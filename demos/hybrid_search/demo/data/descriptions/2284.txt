This track was written by frontman Scott Stapp to his wife , Jaclyn , to mark the day back in November , 2006 , when she almost walked out on him .
Stapp explained that this event was the turning point in finally confronting his well-publicized demons , which included depression-fueled bouts with alcohol and drugs .
`` That 's the day that rock star with the long hair died , '' he said .
`` I had to go a thousand feet backwards to move forwards , to get back to what I was before 2002 , rediscover myself mentally , emotionally and spiritually , then grow from there .
By no means have I arrived at my destination , but the issues that would have devastated all that I loved in my life are now gone .
I originally wanted to translate the title of the song into Arabic because my wife is from Jordan . ''
