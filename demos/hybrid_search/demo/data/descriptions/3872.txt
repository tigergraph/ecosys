This brooding , down-tempo track was premiered during frontman Eddie Vedder 's US solo tour .
Vedder told VertigoFM that this , `` is a song taken from the perspective of a man who is still sitting in a bar after everyone else has left . ''
He added that even though the song is sad it became more `` confident '' when played with the whole band .
This track with complex chord changes originated from a songwriting session Vedder had with Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood .
He explained to the Toronto Globe and Mail : `` I was working with Ronnie Wood on a record he 's putting together .
He asked me if I could contribute some words , which really excited me because I love his voice .
This particular song was a little difficult to transcribe though , so it ended up in -LSB- Pearl Jam 's -RSB- court .
I played it to Brendan -LSB- O'Brien , producer -RSB- at four in the afternoon , and by the next afternoon it was complete . ''
