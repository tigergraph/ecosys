Frontman Dave Mustaine originally penned the song 's riff in the mid 1990s but it did n't find its way onto record until Megadeth 's 2011 TH1RT3EN album .
Bass player Dave Ellefson recalled to MusicRadar.com : `` I 'm so happy that the riff matured into a complete song -- it 's so menacing .
-LSB- laughs -RSB- I seem to recall playing the basis for the song in Rome , Italy , during a soundcheck , and I remember seeing the janitor and the popcorn lady turning around and getting into it .
That meant something to me . ''
-LSB- laughs -RSB- The deadly nightshade plant -LRB- common name belladonna -RRB- is native to Europe , North Africa , and Western Asia .
The foliage and berries are extremely toxic , and can cause a bizarre delirium and hallucinations .
It has a long history of use as a poison and in Roman times the wife of Emperor Augustus and the wife of Claudius both used it to murder contemporaries.Though rarely used as a cosmetic now , historically women used drops prepared from the plant to enlarge their pupils and make their eyes sparkle .
Its common name originates from the Italian ` Bella Donna ' meaning ` beautiful woman . ' ''
