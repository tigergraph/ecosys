This track evolved over a long period of time .
Vocalist/guitarist John Bramwell told The Sun : `` The first eight notes of this song occurred to me whilst practicing guitar as a teenager .
For a great many years , I could n't find a way to continue the melody as strong as the opening part .
I 've never had this happen before or since .
Usually everything arrives almost fully formed and we mainly work on editing it.I was driving to Salford for one of our early album rehearsals and started humming it to myself and , hey presto , the rest of the song came . ''
Branwell told 7Digital , that this song and another Let It All In track `` Mouth On Me '' are `` two sides of the same coin .
He explained : '' ` Mouth On Me ' is about feeling like I did n't fit in when I was young , and ` Masquerade ' is about saying that I still do n't fit in , but so what ?
