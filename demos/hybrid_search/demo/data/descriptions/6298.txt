This Latin-flavored dance song is a track from American new wave band Blondie 's ninth studio album , Panic Of Girls .
The band co-wrote the song with Paradise N. Efecto , a Cuban singer and producer .
Debbie Harry told Spinner how the collaboration came about : `` She actually was a friend of our keyboard player Matt Katz-Bohen .
He came in with this idea that was n't really sort of fleshed out .
So we put bits of that together - it was a really great experience .
We sort of all put our two cents into it .
It sounds great live too .
We added this acoustic guitar intro and it 's fantastic . ''
Zach Condon of American indie folk band Beirut plays trumpet on this track .
Said Harry to Spinner : `` We both knew about Beirut .
Chris -LSB- Stein , guitarist -RSB- came across them and fell madly in love .
We went to a couple of shows , and I think Chris and Zach started e-mailing and they were sort of put in touch with each other .
I went to see them in Texas before all that happened and I was really , really impressed .
Having my little jazz experience and then hearing what these guys were doing and some of the things they were incorporating was just really exciting , really beautiful . ''
