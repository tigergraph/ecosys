Guitarist Anand Wilder explained to MTV News about this funky and pulsing number : `` I wanted to do this loopy thing that would go over and over again , kind of like that final scene in Trainspotting , and then it would just drop into this R&B , Justin Timberlake-y kind of thing , which I made the melody by just creating MIDI notes on GarageBand with just a flute .
That had some acoustic guitar on it ... but then when we brought it Upstate , we added more synthetic elements , and we kind of decided the beat was going to be a dancehall thing , because we were listening to a lot -LSB- of it -RSB- and just kind of straight ripped off those songs . ''
Wilder -LRB- From Drowned in Sound -RRB- : `` I was trying to sing a song that Justin Timberlake would sing and the really long intro I wanted to be something like a late '90s Blur song , but then we reconceptualised it as an early '90s club anthem .
We wanted it to sound like a future band , all these different things coming in , like there 's even a country and western guitar in there , but then it all comes in with a kind of Beatles-esque chorus , very simple , clich√©d . ''
