This redneck wedding tale was penned by Casey Beathard , Monty Criswell and Ed Hill .
Though Adkins did n't write the song , he did create the minister 's dialogue .
He built the character around the Rev. I.M. Madd , a fictitious character that was developed by the late Tommy Collins , a Country music singer-songwriter who wrote George Strait 's `` If You Ai n't Lovin ' -LRB- You Ai n't Livin ' -RRB- '' and Merle Haggard 's `` Carolyn . ''
`` The preacher was always kind of half in the bag every mornin ' when he 'd deliver a sermon , '' Trace noted to GAC .
`` There was no tellin ' what he was gon na say , so that 's kinda how I did it .
`` Adkins also drew on the memory of his own wedding experience .
`` My second marriage , the guy that married us in Tahoe was drunk - I 'll never forget that , '' the singer laughed .
`` He called me Julie , pointed right at me , ` Do you , Julie ... ? '
you know .
So I was channelin ' that guy , and when I started the song I just went , ` Aaaaah , dearly beloved we 're gathered up in here today to join in holy monogamony ' - I made that word up , I thought it was funny though ! ''
