Carrie Underwood told Billboard magazine that this song contains her `` favorite line of the whole album , It pretty much sums up everything that I 've been through , and I think everybody could find something in this particular line : ` God put us here on this carnival ride/We close our eyes never knowing where it will take us next . '
It 's beautiful and so true .
We do n't know what we 're doing or where we 're headed .
We just kind of trust and hope that whatever ride we 're on in life takes us where we need to go . ''
