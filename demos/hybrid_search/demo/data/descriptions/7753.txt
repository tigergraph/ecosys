This was released as the first single from former Wolfmother frontman Andrew Stockdale 's first solo album , Keep Moving .
The song features the final lineup of Andrew Stockdale 's former band Wolfmother , as Ian Peres -LRB- bass , organ , Wurlitzer electric piano -RRB- , Vin Steele -LRB- rhythm guitar -RRB- , Elliott Hammond -LRB- Wurlitzer electric piano , bongos -RRB- and Hamish Rosser -LRB- drums -RRB- join him on the track .
Stockdale explained to Billboard magazine why he decided to release the record under his name rather than Wolfmother .
`` For the last three years I 've performed as Wolfmother , and I do n't feel comfortable about it , '' said the Australian musician .
`` Chris Ross , who played bass and keys in the first line-up when we started , he came up with that band name .
That name was for me , Chris and -LRB- drummer -RRB- Myles Heskett .
It became Wolfmother .
Because of the success of the name , there was pressure then to call yourself Wolfmother .
But it felt weird . ''
The song grapples with the theme of others ' expectations .
`` It 's about when people pigeonhole you , and categorize you , '' said Stockdale .
`` It 's not up to anyone else to tell you the way your dreams can be fulfilled .
It 's up to you to follow your heart and try make things happen .
Whatever someone thinks you can or ca n't do , it 's not up to them .
It 's up to the individual .
And if someone thinks they 've got me all worked out , well , hey , I 've got a long way to go . ''
