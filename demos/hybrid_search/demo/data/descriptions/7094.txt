The third single from Patrick Wolf 's fifth studio album Lupercalia finds the English singer-songwriter singing of contentment at home with a lover .
Written and produced by Wolf , it was released as a digital download on May 8 , 2011 .
The album title refers to the Lupercalia festival , which is was an ancient fertility and love festival that the ancient Romans celebrated between February 13-15 , and was the predecessor to Valentine 's Day .
Wolf explained to Digital Spy : '' Songs about love are obviously the most common theme in pop music , but I wanted to approach it in a way that had n't been done before . ''
Wolf alludes to Thomas Hardy 's novel Return of the Native in the chorus , and also cites poets William Butler Yeats and Dylan Thomas in the second verse .
The song 's music video was filmed in Los Angeles in April 2011 and directed by Andy Bruntel , who has also created visuals for Modest Mouse and Liars .
It sees the singer sharing his house with various animals and elaborates on the song 's themes of domestic contentment .
