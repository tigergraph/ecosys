David Bowie -LRB- from the Mail on Sunday June 29 , 2008 -RRB- : `` So it 's late morning and I 'm thinking : ` New song and a fresh approach .
I know , I 'm going to do a Ronnie Spector .
Oh yes I am .
Ersatz , just for one day . '
And I did and here it is .
Bless .
I 'm still enamored of this song and would give you two ` Modern Loves ' for it any time .
It 's also one that I find fulfilling to sing onstage .
It has some nice interesting sections to it that can trip you up , always a good kind of obstacle to contend with live .
Ironically , the lyric is something about taking a short view of life , not looking too far ahead and not predicting the oncoming hard knocks .
The lyric might have been a note to a younger brother or my own adolescent self . ''
In the same Mail on Sunday interview Bowie referred to guitarists `` the great Robert Fripp and my long-time friend Carlos Alomar '' forming `` a splintery little duel . ''
While Fripp is best known for his membership of the progressive rock band King Crimson , Alomar is an American session guitarist who has played on more Bowie albums than any other musician .
Among the Bowie songs he has played on are `` Young Americans , '' `` Fame '' and `` Boys Keep Swinging . ''
