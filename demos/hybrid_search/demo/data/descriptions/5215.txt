This is the second single from English singer-songwriter Newton Faulkner 's sophomore album , Rebuilt by Humans .
Earle explained the song in a blog : `` I 'm sure everyone has experienced unrequited love , and this song is just about feeling totally invisible to someone who you really want to be with . ''
This song was originally written by English singer-songwriter Ben Earle .
Faulkner then revamped it for his purposes .
He explained to IndieLondon : `` That song has had a strange journey because it was kind of delivered in another form .
Occasionally , people come to me and say we think you should check this out .
If you make it yours and move it around a bit , we think it could be really good .
This was one of those but it 's the only one that 's really come to anything .
With this , I had a listen and got involved .
I met up with the guy that came up with it in its original form and then re-wrote most of the lyrics and went back to square one .
It 's not something I really do normally .
I write with my brother quite a bit , so we had a starting point that was n't quite right that we kind of twisted into shape . ''
