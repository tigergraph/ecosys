This song deals with the subject of bullying .
Craig David explained to the Metro newspaper August 19 , 2005 , why he chose this topic : `` I wanted to write something about my experience of being bullied on the first album but it happened when I was 15 and I wrote the album at 18 so I was still a bit too close to it .
I felt more confident this time .
I do n't want to preach about it because I have n't got the answer to bullying - it 's a problem that 's going to go on for generations to come because it 's in the psyche of people who are insecure about something and ca n't deal with it .
They force the yin yang they have in their heads on to another person .
They put their problems on to someone else and make them deal with it .
It 's only now that I look back and I realize how badly bullied I was .
When you wake up every day thinking how you 're going to get to school without being beaten up , you begin to realize how bad the situation is .
I wanted to say I 've experienced bullying like anyone else and show people who might be going through the same thing that it does n't have to affect you .
They can think : ` He was bullied and he 's not doing too badly . '
I want to put some positive meaning on to what I experienced . ''
