Regions Of Light And Sound Of God was inspired by minister/engraver Lynd Ward 's wordless 1929 graphic novel God 's Man , which was made entirely out of woodcuts .
It tells of a struggling artist who sells his soul to the devil in order to become successful .
James recorded the album at his home studio Removador Fun Ranch and handled nearly all the instrumentation bar a few string and drum parts .
He worked on and off on the project over a period of a couple years when he had time away from his day job as My Morning Jacket frontman .
James explained to Spin magazine : `` I have a collection of studio gear and a studio at my house and whenever I 'm not on the road I 'm always working and these songs would pop in my head .
And they would just tell me that they wanted me to work on them by myself and be part of the album . ''
Regarding this track , James told Billboard magazine : `` That started as a sample of a Dr. Dog song that they would play live but never released .
I really liked it and they hated it , but it had this super cool instrumental breakdown that I wanted to sample and the only recording of the song was a shi -- y board recording .
I took the guitar solo section , sampled that and then started making a sound collage out of different elements of that . ''
