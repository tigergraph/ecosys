It was released digitally on December 21 , 2010 .
McCartney told Just Jared how the three songwriters were influenced by U2 for this tune : `` We wanted to do something on the record that was sort of mid-tempo and we were actually listening to some Bono records and really wanted to have an anthemic vibe to it .
` One Night ' is really an anthemic ballad and reminds me of Bono 's melodies .
This record quickly became one of my favorite songs on the album . ''
