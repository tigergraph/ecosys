This was the title track of Gary Moore 's multi-million selling album and was a return to the Blues music of his youth .
Gary Moore explains , `` I left Lizzy in 1980 , and had a band called G-Force , then got into my solo thing .
I found that when I was in my dressing room , warming up for a gig , I would be playing blues , so I felt I was getting a bit of a message from that .
Around ' 89 , I started playing Blues again . ''
In late 2008 , a German court ruled that Gary Moore stole the guitar solo for this song from the 1974 song `` Nordrach '' by the German band Jud 's Gallery .
The court ordered Moore and his record label to pay unspecified damages to Jud 's Gallery band leader Juergen Winter , who brought the lawsuit .

But when it came time to do ` Still Got The Blues , ' I took it to the studio to test the room .
The first day , we did ` Still Got The Blues ' in one take , straight through ; it was really a dramatic day ; I 'll never forget it . ''
