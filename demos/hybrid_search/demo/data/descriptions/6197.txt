South Londoner Jessie Ware is a soulful singer-songwriter who trained classically at primary school .
After finishing her English literature degree at Sussex University , Brighton , Ware started out in 2010 as an occasional backing singer for her old school friend Jack Peñate , whilst working as a journalist on the Jewish Chronicle and as a P.A. in a production company .
Ware quit the latter job when she was invited to tour with Peñate , during which the singer was introduced to masked producer SBTRKT .
That same year Ware lent her thick , silky vocals to SBTRKT 's tune , `` Nervous , '' and her ability to ride the Dubstep musician 's skittering beats earned Ware a solo deal .
`` Devotion '' is the title track of her debut album , which was released by PMR Records on August 20 , 2012 .
Dave Okumu , who is the frontman for the UK Alt-Rock act The Invisible , produced this title track .
In fact , it was Okumu 's rough demo for the song that established the direction for the project .
`` We were gon na just write together , '' Ware explained to Billboard magazine , `` and he had this idea for a song called ` Devotion ' and had the first verse and the chorus .
It was just the most beautiful thing to me , and I went , ` Oh my God .
This is exactly the kind of music I wanted to make . ' ''
Ware told The Sun that Devotion is , `` my first real attempt at writing and learning how to be a songwriter . ''
She continued : `` It is honest and romantic and combines all of my different musical passions from Hip-Hop to Disney music . ''
The Digital Spy site selected Devotion as their top album of 2012 .
They said : `` A smart and sophisticated debut that remains utterly compelling throughout , and serves as a message to guest vocalists everywhere that there is plenty of light at the end of the tunnel . ''
