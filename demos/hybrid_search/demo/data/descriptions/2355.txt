Keane 's main songwriter Tim Rice-Oxley penned this on the same day as `` Silenced By The Night , '' `` Black Rain '' and `` Run With Me '' -LRB- which can be found on the Deluxe Edition of Strangeland -RRB- .
He also wrote three Mt. Desolation songs , `` Dividing Line , '' `` Your Kind Of Life , '' and `` Wherever You Were Going , '' during what must have been a particularly satisfying 24 hours .
Rice-Oxley discussed the song 's meaning : `` I think the emotional content of this one is quite representative of the whole album - the story is basically ` I 've realized that I have no idea what 's going on in life , so I 'm not going to judge anyone else ! '
I feel it has an atmosphere of sympathy and grace . ''
According to Rice-Oxley , singer Tom Chaplin was especially enthusiastic about this track .
He said : `` That 's often the way it works - you have a lot of songs that everyone agrees on , but then each band member will have a song that they really champion because they hear something in it that everyone else has n't quite picked up on yet .
With Richard -LRB- Hughes , drums -RRB- it was The Starting Line . ''
The song 's middle 8 is one of Rice-Oxley 's favourite parts of Strangeland .
He said : `` Under the word ` time ' at the end of the middle 8 you may be able to make out the four of us all singing ` Aaaaah ' very operatically .
Like a choir of angels falling down an elevator shaft . ''
