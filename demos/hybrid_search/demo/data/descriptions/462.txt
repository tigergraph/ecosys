This is the debut single by husband and wife American country duo Thompson Square .
Keifer Thompson explained the story behind this song to The Boot : `` You write sad songs when you 're in a bad relationship , or you 're depressed .
Our whole thing was , we 've been getting along so well , let 's write a song about two people getting along so well that they have to fight to make up .
It 's just a fun thing . ''
