Johnson co-wrote this song with Teddy Gentry of the band Alabama .
This song is about a musician 's relationship with his mom .
CMT News asked Johnson what his own mother thought of this song .
He replied : `` She cried .
Mom was a big Alabama fan growing up .
She got the first record out of the box every time they put out a record .
For her , just to know that I even met him , she thought that was the coolest thing in the world .
I had met him here and there , and we traded phone numbers and kept talking about writing a song and everything else .
He just called me up out of the blue one day and said , ` Man , I 'm up in my office .
Come over here and write a song with me . '
I turned my truck around so fast , I probably cut across the median on I-40 .
-LRB- laughs -RRB- But I got over there , and as soon as I sat down , the first thing I thought about was mama .
We sat and wrote this song about a phone conversation from the road talking to mama .
And when you get out there , sometimes you get a little disconnected .
Mama 's always that force that brings it all right back to you and puts your feet back on the ground a little bit . ''
