But I had to . ''
-LRB- thanks , DeeTheWriter - Saint Petersburg , Russia Federation -RRB- The song starts with the line : `` He 's a real live-wire , he 's the best of his kind , wait till you see those eyes ... '' addressed to Bailey Rae 's late husband .
She explained to The Daily Telegraph January 25 , 2010 : `` That was a line that just came out .
I feel like I 've been playing music and writing music to help me with all the different emotions that I 've been feeling .
When I started writing that song I was thinking , ' I do n't really want this song to go into the world , because it 's so naked . '' '
Bailey Rae told The Sun November 27 , 2009 about this haunting lost-love piece : `` It 's quite an erotic song , a big love song about the intoxicating feeling of love .
I went into a florists one day and saw this massive bunch of tuberose flowers and the smell just blew me away like that feeling of love does and I was overwhelmed and wrote that song about how I felt . ''
Bailey Rae explained to The Daily Telegraph that there is intentionally no question mark in the song title because , `` I did n't want it to seem like there 's a desperation in it with it being so obviously a question . ''
