In late 1966 The Kinks were performing in small villages near Devon , England .
The experience inspired Ray Davies to write this song , which they recorded that November .
The song , in turn , inspired their sixth album released 2 years later , also during the holiday season , The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society .
