The original version of `` Capital Radio '' -LRB- known now as `` Capital Radio One '' -RRB- , was released in 1977 .
It was becoming very difficult to get hold of , as the original single it was released on was a limited run .
Because it was such a popular song live , the band recorded an updated version of the song for the Cost of Living EP in January 1979 to please the fans who wanted a recorded version of the song .
The studio version features elements of the live performance of the song .
For example , Mick Jones ' arpeggio acoustic guitar intro is based on improvised introductions to the live version .
It then moves into a call-and-response conversation between Jones and singer Joe Strummer , where Strummer explains what he thinks The Clash should do if they want to get played on the radio -LRB- `` Hey listen , I 've been thinking , we 'll never get on the radio like this !
You know that ?
Now , I 've been studying the charts , using my mind and my imagination ! '' -RRB-
before the whole song morphs into a cod-disco-funk outro , with Strummer spouting stream-of-consciousness lines and referencing `` You 're The One That I Want , '' Olivia Newton John and John Travolta 's iconic song from the hit movie Grease -LRB- `` I 'm the one that I want ! '' -RRB- .
The reference to `` the drummer in the box office counting the money '' is apparently to do with drummer Topper Headon , who first brought Disco and Funk music influences to the group .
