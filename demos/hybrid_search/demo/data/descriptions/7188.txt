The title track of Katy B 's Danger EP is a downtempo torch song containing a series of collapsing relationship/extinguished joint metaphors such as `` bright red flame '' and `` burning our love away . ''
Canadian Jacques Greene produced the song .
Katy told NME : `` He did a remix of ` Broken Record ' that I loved so much .
He 's got an R&B soul like me . ''
Katy gives a nod to another song about weed , The Mighty Diamonds ' `` Pass The Kutchie , '' when she songs on the bridge , `` Yeah , you passed my love to the left-hand side . ''
You may be more familiar with the 1982 adaptation by Musical Youth which was altered to the more radio-friendly `` Pass the Dutchie . ''
