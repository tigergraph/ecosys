This is one of several songs on Stories To Tell that were inspired by Barnes becoming a father for the first time .
He explained to Artist Direct : `` We did n't know if the baby was going to be a boy or a girl .
We waited to find out .
The mystery was in front of us .
That song was so fun to write because it was a huge question mark .
That 's where the song comes from .
We were welcoming the baby into who we are and the way we are - the quirks good and bad . ''
Barnes told Artist Direct why he chose this as Stories To Tell 's closing track .
`` I always try to end albums with a poignant piece of music , '' he explained . ''
` One Of Us ' seemed to be the best for that .
I did n't want that in the middle of the record .
If you do follow the arc of us knowing we 're having a baby , ending the record with .
` One Of Us ' follows the theme .
It made sense to put it at the end . ''
