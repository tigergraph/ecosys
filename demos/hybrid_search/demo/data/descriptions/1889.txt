This Dancehall synth track is from the American Jewish Reggae artist Matisyahu 's third studio album , Light .
The song also appeared on Matisyahu 's 2008 EP Shattered .
Matisyahu was Hasidic at the time living as an orthodox Jew .
In 2011 , he shaved his beard , forcing editors everywhere to omit the word `` Hasidic '' from their descriptions .
Matisyahu told Starpulse.com that one of the main inspirations for the Shattered EP had been a story called The Seven Beggars written by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov , who lived in the 1800 's .
He explained : `` It 's okay not to be familiar with the story since , despite it being a big inspiration , it 's only subtly mentioned in the song .
The story is of these two children who escape the sacking of their kingdom .
They end up spending seven days and nights in the forest .
Each night a different beggar comes to them with bread and water , but they wo n't take them out of the forest .
Each beggar has an apparent deficiency that turns out to actually be their advantage in their services to God .
There are all these stories within the story .
One of the beggars is a hunchback , who is little but carries a lot .
And this beggar knows of a tree that 's on the side of a road to nowhere .
It casts a shade that has a place for every creature in the world .
For every bird a spot on its branch .
At the end of that song , it says like , ' I am searching for the shade of the tree , I heard about it in the breeze , they say it exists at the side of the road , which road nobody was told . '
That 's one aspect of the song , but it 's multi dimensional .
There 's also the idea of extremities and going from a high to low place , or of being in the process of high being low . ''
