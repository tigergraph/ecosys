In 2007 Jason Michael Carroll hit the Country charts with `` Livin ' Our Love Song , '' a song he wrote for his wife when they 'd reconnected after many years spent apart .
This song continues that story .
Jason told us : '' ` Wendy and I , my wife now , we dated for a while in high school , under the radar , she was a little bit younger than me , and her mom and dad found out and they actually sent her away to college , to out of state , to get her away from me .
And it worked .
Because she got married , and I got married .
Seven years went by .
She got divorced , and here I was divorced with three kids .
And I remember her coming to a bar and us hitting it off like we 'd never missed a day .
And so I remember dating for a while .
I think I 'd just signed my record deal when we found out she was pregnant with J.W. And here she was , graduated from college , successful x-ray tech at Wake Forest Baptist Hospital , here I was a Country music singer , just seemed like I 'd achieved my dreams of getting a record deal .
And then from both sides we were both hearing , ` You 've thrown it all away , all your hard work .
You 've thrown it all away . '
And that 's kind of where the song came from .
But now we have the children that we have , Wendy 's a great stepmother to my oldest three , and she 's a great mom to Junior .
It 's really been kind of one of the best things that 's ever happened to either one of us .
Even with all of our success outside of career-wise .
`` And about those types of people who like to stick their noses in your business ?
Jason shrugs it off .
`` I love it when it works out , '' he laughs .
`` I say , This may not have been what you would have done , but it 's best for us . ''
The best revenge is to just be happy .
