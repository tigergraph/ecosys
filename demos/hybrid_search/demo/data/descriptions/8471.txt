`` Anchors '' is one of the most personal songs that Emery 's frontman Toby Morrell has ever written .
He explained why in an interview with Alternative Press : `` This was a tough song for me to write lyrically .
It 's a very personal story from my past .
When I was in elementary school , a girl who liked me and her friend were making fun of me because that 's what you do when you like someone .
But I did n't see it that way and said something pretty terrible to the girl -- something I could n't take back -- and those words have haunted me for years .
I felt like I changed that day and saw the world differently .
I feel like this song was a little cathartic , and it helped me face some things about myself and realize I was a kid and never intended to hurt someone the way that I did . ''
