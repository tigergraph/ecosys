This is one of three new songs included on Desperate Measures .
Keyboardist J-Dog told Artist Direct about the track : `` I wrote the music , and Charlie Scene wrote the lyrics .
It 's another old school Hollywood Undead song .
We tried to get back to our roots with that one .
It 's funny !
When I heard those lyrics , I started cracking up . ''
