Between the release of her 2010 album The Age Of Miracles and 2012 's Ashes and Roses , Mary Chapin Carpenter was forced to endure more than her share of heartache .
`` They say that the worst , the most traumatic things that people can go through in their lives are a divorce , the loss of a parent and serious illness , '' she said .
`` All of those things have happened to me in the last few years . ''
`` So these are the songs that came about when I started to write , '' continued Carpenter .
`` To try and push them away , or write about something else , did not seem possible .
Songwriting is what I do .
This is how I make sense of things , it 's how I seek connection and make my way through the world . ''
`` Ashes and Roses is a record about grief and loss , '' she concluded , `` but it has an arc .
It does go from night into day .
I feel like it travels through some of the hardest , most difficult territory to a place of renewal .
It speaks to that journey as it tries to describe what is seen and felt and experienced along the way .
And one does get to the other side '' .
This song finds Carpenter on a journey toward finding connection in the world again .
It is a duet with James Taylor , and she told Billboard magazine about her excitement about collaborating with the singer-songwriter legend .
`` He 's so wonderful , '' she said .
`` It was such a thrill that he wanted to do this .
He 's such an icon , and this song feels like a gift .
When the day comes when stuff like that do n't thrill you , maybe , it 's time to hang it up . ''
