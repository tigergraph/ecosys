Coxon told The Sun May 8 , 2009 that he likes this song , `` because it 's my lunatic attempt at a bossa nova style .
I was always a fan of Stan Getz 's The Girl From Ipanema .
Very Sixties , very smooth with a slightly Latin feel .
I just wanted to do that but really fast . ''
The Spinning Top is a concept album which follows a man from birth to death .
Coxon explained to XFM : `` It 's about a man who is born in , um , possibly the '50s .
Grows up , meets a girl , gets married , then has to go to war and gets really knackered up and then has a divorce and then goes mad and then ... er ... dies and goes to heaven . ''
Coxon explained to The Sun that this song has , `` got -LRB- Pentangle bassist -RRB- Danny Thompson on it and Graham Fox plays drums .
I play a little saxophone on that to conjure up images of rabbits in fields as there were millions of them everywhere in Kent . ''
Coxon told The Sun why the project evolved into a concept album : `` As I was writing , these songs got more elaborate in my head .
They were all suggesting lifetime events .
There was a song about war - Sorrow 's Army , then November - which sounded like a funeral .
Before I recorded the songs , I added a story to them , so I could focus on them in order .
It 's not something which is really important to people listening , though - if you like the story that 's fine .
I do n't want to over-egg the custard on that one . ''
