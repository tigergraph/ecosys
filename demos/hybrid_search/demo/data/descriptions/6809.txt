This was the first song written for The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here .
It was penned by singer-guitarist Jerry Cantrell in 2011 before he went into hospital to fix his damaged shoulder cartridge .
He told Grammy.com : `` Before I had the surgery I think I demoed ` Voices ' really quick , that was a kind of quick song and came together within a couple of days of just me messing around here at the house .
It was right after tour and it was a good , strong song and so I sent it around to everybody and everybody liked it and I thought , ` F -- k , that 's good . '
That was the first thing that came together on the record , so I knew there was a good song there . ''
