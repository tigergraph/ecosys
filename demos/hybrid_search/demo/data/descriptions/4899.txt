The title track of Lindsey Buckingham 's sixth solo album is about the notion that things will happen to you good or bad , according to the choices you make .
He explained to Spinner : `` You could probably say that we are all to some degree the sum total of the choices we 've made , and that we are living in a world where people seem to make choices that are based on only what 's right in front of them , and only the sense of what feeds their own need or their own ego in that particular moment .
Every time you put something out there - an energy or a choice for the good or for the ill - you 're sowing a seed of some kind , and in a karmic way , it 's gon na come back . ''
The song title comes from the letter of Galatians 6 v7 in the New Testament , in which Paul writes , `` A man reaps what he sows '' to indicate every action breeds consequences .
Paul is warning the Galatians that choices based purely on following ones desires will reap a crop of sorrow and evil whilst good , unselfish choices will result in joy and eternal life .
