Brooklyn quintet Friends may be a Pop band , but their lyrical content is more thoughtful than many others in their genre .
`` One thing that I think is really cool is to create a sense of joy and empowerment , '' said Samantha Urbani to The Independent .
`` But not just with a message of jubilant positivity - we have a song about death and anticipating it called ` Ideas on Ghosts , ' but it 's a dance song so you reach this level of cathartic movement and energised dancing , but with a sense of awareness of all the negativity and all of the sadness and all of the spectrum of human feelings .
I think it 's really cool because a lot of dance songs are just sexy come-ons .
This is thinking persons ' pop music , I hope . ''
