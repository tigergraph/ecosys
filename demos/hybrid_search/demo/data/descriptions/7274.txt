The song 's lyrics are about someone losing their virginity .
It has been reported that the track was named after Dan Savage 's ` It Gets Better ' viral video campaign which was founded in response to the suicides of teenagers who were bullied because they were gay .
One can presume , therefore , the lyrics refer to a person 's first sexual experience with another member of the same gender .
Fun guitarist Jack Antonoff is an advocate for equal rights and marriage equality , and he wrote in a blog on the The Huffington Post that he believes this issue is as important as the civil rights struggles of the '60s .
`` Being part of a band of three straight men , we felt there was an inherent power in the fact that we are n't gay , and yet we still care and we have a voice - there 's a responsibility there , '' he said .
`` There are moments in history where it 's vital -LSB- to have a voice -RSB- and anyone that is not standing up for the LGBT community is a huge part of what 's holding them back . ''
