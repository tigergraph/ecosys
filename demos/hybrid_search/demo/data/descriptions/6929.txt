On September 21 , 2011 R.E.M. announced on their website that the band was disbanding .
Simultaneously with the surprising news , it was revealed that the trio would be releasing one last album , a double-disc retrospective compiled by the band members containing three new songs .
The title of the set came from a quip that guitarist Peter Buck made about the band during an interview in 1988 , `` R.E.M is part lies , part heart , part truth and part garbage . ''
A pair of black-and-white videos was made for the song , which were directed by Michael Stipe and Dominic DeJoseph .
One stars actress Kirsten Dunst , whilst the other features poet and performance artist John Giorno .
This orchestral ballad is one of the three new songs on the collection .
It was recorded after the sessions for R.E.M. 's last studio album , Collapse Into Now and was released as the band 's last ever single on October 18 , 2011 .
The track addresses the disbanding of R.E.M. Speaking with Billboard magazine , bassist Mike Mills explained the story of the song : `` As with all R.E.M. songs , guitarist Peter -LSB- Buck -RSB- and I write the music and Michael -LSB- Stipe -RSB- writes the lyrics .
That 's our division of labor .
Some songs come out really quickly and some take a lot of work .
This one was actually written on piano for -LSB- 2011 's -RSB- Collapse Into Now .
It did n't get finished and I liked it enough that I wanted to try to work it into the retrospective .
So I rewrote it and played it on guitar instead of piano .
Once I got the piano off of it , Michael was re-inspired by it and found it easier to write to on guitar than piano . ''
