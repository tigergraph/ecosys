Lead guitarist Will Nutter discussed this tune with The Alternative Press : `` This song coincides with ` Shine ' in the sense that you ca n't let what others think hold you back from being yourself .
This song has one of my favorite lines on the whole album : ` This is every reason why I live my life like I do . ' ''
