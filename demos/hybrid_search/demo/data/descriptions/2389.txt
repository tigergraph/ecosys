Chris Tomlin told Christian Music Today that good worship songs occur naturally .
He explained : `` The songs that come out of your heart as a response to God as you 're singing at the piano or reading Scripture - those are the songs -LSB- that have the most impact -RSB- .
That 's why I 'm most proud of a song on the new record like ` Praise the Father , Praise the Son . '
It came about naturally .
When you 're just singing out to God and worshipping him , those are the songs that last . ''
Tomlin explained in the same interview the reason for the Hello Love album title : `` There are so many things in those two words .
First , I just love the way those two words sound together .
It 's a beautiful thing .
But it 's way more than that - it also causes people to think .
The ` love ' idea to me is , when you break everything down in life , it all comes down to love .
Worship is a big thing in our lives , but when you break it all down , it 's love : ` To love the Lord your God with all your heart , your soul , your mind , your strength , and to love your neighbor as yourself . '
To me our greatest need in the world is not another song , but it 's the singers of the songs meeting the needs of the world .
`` Tomlin added , `` Hello Love -LSB- means -RSB- we want to reintroduce ourselves to love again .
That 's the idea : if we 've forgotten what it 's about , then let 's reintroduce ourselves .
It all comes down to love .
It 's what love to God and for God is all about .
Hopefully these songs inspire that .
Hopefully these songs cause people to love God even more , to get closer to God , and that it inspires people to love each other and make a difference in the world . ''
