It appears Taio Cruz drank too much on the lead single from his third studio album , TY.O .
Having got trashed the night before , he 's now suffering from a hangover but still wants somebody to pour him some more .
It 's no surprise to hear Cruz admitting that he `` do n't ever ever want to grow up . ''
The explanation for the album title lies with Taio 's frustration regarding the incorrect pronunciation of his name .
Its title is the phonetic pronunciation of the two syllables `` TY '' and `` O '' creating TY.O or Taio .
The song 's music video is a spin on the 2009 hit movie Hangover .
Flo Rida makes a cameo whilst actor-comedian Bobby Lee plays the character of Taio 's assistant , who dresses as a bear being bottle-fed in a cot .
Cruz 's fellow drinker US rapper Flo Rida spits a verse on this club banger , which was produced by American producer Dr. Luke .
The British singer and hitmaker previously worked together on another party anthem , `` Dynamite . ''
However , the good doctor does n't appear to have a cure for Cruz 's hangover .
Ironically , Cruz himself is not a drinker .
The singer told Artist Direct the inspiration for this song came to him when he was out partying with friends in Ibiza .
Said Cruz : `` It 's quite funny , I do n't drink myself .
It 's not a true story -LSB- about me -RSB- but about everyone who goes out and goes crazy , and has an incredible party .
You wake up remembering the night before , with a mild headache .
I thought it was fun and I thought it really tracks the way those people live . ''
