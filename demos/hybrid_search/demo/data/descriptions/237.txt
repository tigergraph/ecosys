This is the initial song to be released from Worship Music , the tenth studio album by American thrash metal band Anthrax .
It was their first album of original material since 2003 's We 've Come for You All .
Anthrax lead guitarist Rob Caggiano told Guitar World about this tune : `` That was kind of the first song we started playing as a band , even in the rehearsal room .
It was one of the first songs that got finished , so we started playing it a lot .
It 's a song that 's got all the elements of what the band is about ; it 's got the thrashy vibe , it 's got melody , it 's got a groove , it 's got a lot of over-the-top playing in it . ''
In our interview with Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante , he recalled guitarist Scott Ian `` being really excited back when we got together and started writing . ''
The stickman added : `` He was excited about the riffs .
If there 's one thing about Scott , he loves a fast fu -- in ' riff .
He either loves a real fast riff or real heavy type of riff .
So with ` Fight 'Em , ' I could tell that he was really happy about , ` This is going to be a new Anthrax song . ' ''
Anthrax fans had a long wait to hear new material from the band .
The album was originally going to be released in May 2009 , but after various delays it finally came out on September 12 , 2011 internationally and September 13 in the US .
