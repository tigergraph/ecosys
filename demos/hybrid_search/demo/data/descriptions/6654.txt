This is the lead track on The Fall , an album recorded and mixed on group founder Damon Albarn 's Apple iPad during Gorillaz 's American leg of their Escape to Plastic Beach World Tour in October 2010 .
Albarn explained on Gorillaz.com that he made the album , `` because there 's a lot of time that you just spend staring at walls essentially .
And it was a fantastic way of doing it .
`` He continued regarding the writing process , `` I literally wrote everything on the day in each place and there 's a strange sort of sound of America and its musical traditions that comes through .
It feels like a journey through America . ''
The Fall was initially released on December 25 , 2010 as a free Christmas download on the Gorillaz website , exclusively to fans who have already purchased a membership in the band 's fan club , Sub-Division .
