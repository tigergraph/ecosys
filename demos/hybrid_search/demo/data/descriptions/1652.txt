This song finds Swift singing about the romantic adventures of Ethel and Bobby Kennedy after coming across a photo of the pair dancing when they were teenagers .
`` She told The Wall Street Journal : `` I get a lot of style inspiration from the 1960s , so I 'll go and look at black and white pictures , and look at -LSB- photos from the -RSB- '50s and '60s , and I came across this picture of these two kids dancing at a dance .
It immediately made me think of like how much fun they must have had that night .
It was back in the late '40s .
I ended up reading underneath that it was Ethel Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy .
And they were like 17 .
So I just kind of wrote that song from that place , not really knowing how they met or anything like that .
And then her daughter Rory ended up coming to a show a couple weeks later and I told her about the song and she was like , you have to meet my mom .
She would love to meet you .
So that was kind of what that song was about .
`` Ethel and Bobby are the grandparents of Conor Kennedy , whom Taylor was dating whilst writing for Red .
The songstress became especially close to Ethel Kennedy during their relationship .
This was co-produced by regular collaborator Nathan Chapman and Dann Huff , who has also worked with Keith Urban and Rascal Flatts .
It was one of three tracks on Red , where Huff co-manned the boards .
`` I chose the artists and the producers because I like their style , '' Swift told USA Today .
`` I did n't choose them because I wanted to force my style on them ; I chose them because I wanted to learn from them .
So they 're true collaborations , it 's not just somebody else singing on one of my songs that sounds like one of my songs .
It 's a real mixture of the two influences . ''
