Frontman James Skelly -LRB- from his record label 's website -RRB- : `` This was inspired by A Perfect Day For Bananafish by JD Salinger and I just wanted to write a song that captured the feel I got from that book then me and Nick -LRB- Power , organ -RRB- finished it off .
It turned out like half Harry Nilsson and half Neil Young .
JD Salinger 's one of the best , he 's really original , he takes a bit from F Scott Fitzgerald yet he has this mood that no one else has .
The song 's about a girl in a hotel , she 's run away and her mum 's worried about her .
That 's all I 'm saying as I do n't want to give it away . ''
A Perfect Day For Bananafish by JD Salinger is a short story , which was originally published in The New Yorker magazine in 1948 .
