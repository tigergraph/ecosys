These New Puritans lead singer and songwriter Jack Barnett explained : '' ` Elvis ' is a pop song , and we 're releasing it because we can be a pop group .
It 's just funny ; we 're not new-rave .
There are many things that could offend me more . ''
The band also features Jack 's twin brother George Barnett on drums , Thomas Hein on bass and sampler and Sophie Sleigh-Johnson on keyboards .
They formed in Southend-on-Sea , England in 2006 .
