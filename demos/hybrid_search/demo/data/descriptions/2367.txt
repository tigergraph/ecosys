This is a track from Confessions , an album based on the seven deadly sins .
Frontman Josh Todd based the album 's lyrics on his childhood and transformation into adulthood and this song was inspired by his father 's suicide .
Speaking with Loudwire , Todd elaborated on its subject matter .
`` There was a point in my life when I was a youth when I lost a family member , '' he explained , `` and I acted out in my grieving process through the deadly sins , so that 's kind of what the story 's about on the record .
I think the seven sins are timeless and that everybody struggles with them in their daily lives all the time . ''
The album is part of a larger vision that includes a film written by Todd about his father 's suicide .
This song provides the cornerstone of the film .
`` It 's loosely based on my life , '' Todd told Noisecreep .
`` When that tragic event happened in my life , with my father , I was 10 .
But the character in the short film is like 17 and he 's in high school .
`` The movie starts with him coming home and finding his father dead and then he acts out the seven sins in the grieving process .
And while he 's doing that , he meets a love interest at school .
She kind of is the polar opposite of him and it softens him up a little bit .
By the end of the film , he learns how to forgive his father and rides off into the sunset with his girl . ''
Speaking with Classic Rock Revisited , Todd explained how he drew on his life experience for this track : '' ` Sloth ' is about the most slothful act that anyone can do , which is to commit suicide , '' he said .
`` That song is actually about the day my dad died .
It was a very hard song for me to get through .
I wanted to be honest and I thought it was time for that .
I 've really grown up since then and evolved and done a lot of work on myself .
I was ready to tell the story and to tell the story in a cool way .
There is a lot of uplifting stuff on the record , but that one tells the story of that day . ''
