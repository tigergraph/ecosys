Incubus originally had some misgivings about this tune before finally deciding to include it on their If Not Now , When album .
Guitarist Mike Einziger told Rock Sound magazine : `` In the context of the album , this song is the black sheep .
We were n't sure if it was going to make the album or not because it 's so different , but we ultimately decided that we all really liked the song and wanted it to be heard .
I think it 's going to take a different shape when we play it live - it feels like it 's going to be a great song to play at a show , and I think our fans will really enjoy it . ''
