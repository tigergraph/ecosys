This is one of three songs on One True Vine that was written by the album 's producer and Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy .
Staples told Mojo magazine the story behind the song : `` Tweedy had the track , '' she recalled , `` and I said .
` You 've got to write lyrics for it . '
When we sat at the -LRB- family -RRB- table for dinner my father would bless the food then one of us would say the verse and my verse was ` Jesus wept . ' ''
The song title is a reference to the Gospel of John 11 v 35 , where Jesus cried openly alongside others over the passing of his friend Lazarus , before raising him from the dead .
`` Jesus wept '' is the shortest verse in the Bible .
Staples recalled to The Music.com the first time that Tweedy played her this song : `` I listened to ` Jesus Wept ' , '' she said , `` I was sitting there on the couch and tears were just streaming down my face .
Tweedy looked over ` Mavis , are you crying ? '
and I said ` Tweedy , you 're not supposed to be looking at me ! ' .
He said ` Oh Mavis , I 'm sorry ' but I said ` That 's just the way this song is hitting me .
But you might have to change the title to Mavis Wept . ''
