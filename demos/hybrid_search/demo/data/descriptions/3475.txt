Frontman Klaus Meine explained this song to Goldmine Magazine : `` It 's a ballad , but more in the true rock ballad fashion .
When Still Loving You , off Love at First Sting was a smash hit back in the '80s , many folks made love to that song .
Many people told us in Europe , especially in France , ` We called our daughter Sly because of Still Loving You .
So I thought it would be a nice idea to write a song about that girl , Sly .
`` In our interview with Scorpions guitarist Rudolf Schenker , he elaborated on the romantic impact `` Still Loving You '' had in France .
Said Schenker : '' ` Still Loving You , ' the song of love , created a baby boom in France .
But we did n't believe it , either , you know ?
We were on a TV show in France between recordings , and the host , a very famous guy that interviews us each year , goes , ` Hey , guys , you know that you are responsible for the baby boom in ' 85 . '
We were laughing like crazy !
And yes , it 's been measured by the government . ''
