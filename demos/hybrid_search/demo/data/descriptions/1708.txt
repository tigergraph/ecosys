This was written by Ne-Yo , who explained to Billboard magazine : `` They were really trying to figure out where to take her .
The main issue with Jennifer Hudson is her voice is so huge , so how do you take that and radio-ize it , make it radio-friendly .
She ca n't do -LRB- ` And I Am Telling You I 'm Not Going ' -RRB- every song 'cause you 'll eventually be tired of it .
So -LRB- ` Spotlight ' -RRB- is kind of a classy midtempo , and I hope and pray it does well 'cause Jennifer is an amazing talent . ''
Jennifer Hudson only managed a 7th place finish when she competed on American Idol , and it was years before her debut album was released .
Her big break came when she was cast in the movie Dreamgirls , where she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress .
