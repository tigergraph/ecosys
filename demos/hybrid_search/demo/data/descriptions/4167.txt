This is one of several songs on Time inspired by Rod 's third wife , Penny Lancaster .
`` Penny was moved when she first heard those songs , '' Stewart told The Sun .
`` And I overheard my singers saying -LRB- about ` She Makes Me Happy ' -RRB- ' I wish someone would write a love song like that for me .
I was touched when I heard that . ''
Time debuted at # 1 on the UK album chart in May 2013 .
It was Rod 's first chart-topping long player of brand new recordings since A Night On The Town in July 1976 setting a new record for the longest gap between chart-topping discs for any British artist .
Bob Dylan retains the overall record , having waited more than 38 years for his 1970 chart topper New Morning to be followed up with another UK # 1 , Together Through Life in 2009 .
Rod did n't hold the record for long as when Black Sabbath debuted at # 1 with their 13 albumin June 2013 , it was their first LP to reach the peak position in nearly 43 years .
Their previous chart-topping record was in October 1970 , when the band 's second set Paranoid reached the summit .
