Tesla guitarist Frank Hannon told Bravewords.com that this song is the opposite of the previous three tracks on the album , which are about personal challenges and things falling apart .
He explained : `` It is about someone being extraordinary and turning you on and digging it .
Life is a constant roller coaster ride .
I mean you have to go through ups and downs that is kind of how our music is .
Some songs are very up , some songs are down .
We are just taking you on the ride . ''
