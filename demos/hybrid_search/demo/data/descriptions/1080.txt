Hardcore Van Halen fans will recognize this song as `` Put Out the Lights , '' which was featured on the Gene Simmons produced demos that the band did for Warner Brothers in 1976 .
It features new lyrics and an altered arrangement but still sounds like a '70s rocker even retaining the cowbell .
The song is one of a number of tracks on A Different Kind Of Truth based on old demos from the 1970s .
They were written at a time when the band credited all four members with co-writing credits , including founding bassist Michael Anthony , who was sacked in 2006 by Eddie Van Halen .
However , he told Planet Rock that he has no plans to pursue the band for his share of royalties from the album. : `` I do n't want to do anything , '' he said .
`` I just let it be .
It 'll be nice to hear some of those old songs again that I have n't played in a long time . ''
