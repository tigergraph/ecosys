This was one of the first songs to be written for Imaginaerum and was described by keyboardist and composer-in-chief , Tuomas Holopainen , as , `` a duel between the Devil and Mother Gaia . ''
-LRB- Mother Gaia is the goddess who the ancients believed represented Earth -RRB- .
He explained to Metal Hammer magazine : `` Since this is a dramatic album about the celebration of life and existence , you need the dark side as well .
I love the dark side and I love all kinds of evil stuff , so we needed a few songs to describe those .
` Ghost River ' and ` Rest Calm ' are the two songs that are talking about the dark side of life . ''
