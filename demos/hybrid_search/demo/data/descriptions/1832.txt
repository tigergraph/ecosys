This is about a guy who goes to a party and has a one-night-stand .
The party is `` Old and uninviting '' until a girl shows up `` In full blown Technicolor . ''
She lightens up everything : `` You enter and close the door behind you ... now show me the stars as seen from the sky . ''
The repetition of `` That kind of girl '' at the end indicates that she is a girl who will have sex with a guy after just meeting him .
