This sweeping epic is a cover of an unreleased track from Muse .
The British prog rock/eletronica three-piece are one of Lambert 's favorite bands .
Lambert told Billboard magazine this song is about a one-night stand .
Lambert told Rolling Stone that this is one of three songs on For Your Entertainment `` that are really emotional , a little bit slower , softer . ''
He added : '' ` Soaked ' opens up with a real soft vocal , it 's very tender , the lyrics are very vulnerable , then it goes into a soaring ballad-type feel .
That was another example - we got the song from Muse , and I was s -- ting myself , I could n't believe it , I thought , ` This is incredible , I ca n't believe they 're giving me a song . '
I 'm a huge fan , and it , too , like the rest of the three that I 'm talking about , have this real retro feel to it , melodically and even in the style of the production , very Seventies , at times very Sixties , almost like a Shirley Bassey song mixed with a Queen record . ''
Lambert explained to MTV News why this track really resonated with him `` I really related to the song , 'cause my interpretation of the lyrics is , it 's kind of about getting wasted and having a one-night stand and that search for fulfillment of the void , '' he said .
`` And how sometimes it does n't quite happen , but your soul will be OK .
It 's not the first time it has happened and how it can kind of be a vicious cycle .
`` Lambert added he could relate to that lonely experience .
`` Personally , for me , when I was singing , I was trying to put myself in that place ... in a slightly darker time , '' he explained . ''
-LSB- I remembered -RSB- how empty that can feel , and I got through it OK , but it 's a struggle .
It sucks and you wake up the next morning -LSB- thinking -RSB- , ` Ugh . '
It 's about that chase . ''
