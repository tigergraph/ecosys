Justin Young told NME about this nostalgic , dreamy love tune : `` Like most great pop songs , it 's a pretty straight-up love song .
Pete -LRB- Robertson , drums -RRB- wrote the verse and bought the idea in - I rewrote some of the lyrics but I did n't want to change the sentiment behind it .
The band have to feel happy standing for everything I say , so I should feel happy standing for what they say too . ''
