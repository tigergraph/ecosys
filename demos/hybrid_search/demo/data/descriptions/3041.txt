Of Montreal 's eleventh album , Paralytic Stalks , finds mainman Kevin Barnes writing lyrics in a dark confessional style .
Speaking with NME he explained : `` Paralytic Stalks is different from my previous few albums , in that none of the songs were written from the perspective of a persona , all of the songs are directly inspired by my personal life and my psychic/emotional/spiritual state .
I was going through a really fu -- ed up period of mental anguish , pessimism and self-hatred , and these songs helped me navigate through it , in a sense .
I attempted to use the creative process as a way to direct all of the negative energy into something more positive and salubrious . ''
Barnes married graphic artist Nina Aimee Gr√∏ttland in 2003 , and this song finds him attempting to unburden himself to her : `` Oh Nina , how can I defend myself against this world ?
, '' he cries .
