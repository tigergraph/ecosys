This was never released as a single in England because it was banned on British radio stations due to suggestive lyrics .
The offending lyric is : `` Spread your wings and let me come inside . ''
The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section played on this .
They were a group of four musicians who started their own studio - Muscle Shoals Sound - in 1969 after doing sessions for FAME studios for Wilson Pickett , Aretha Franklin , and many other popular Soul acts .
The famous story the musicians tell is that when Stewart arrived at the studios and saw the musicians getting ready , he refused to believe they were the band - he was sure the guys he heard playing on those records were black , and had a hard time accepting that four white guys were the band .
Stewart 's girlfriend , Swedish actress Britt Ekland , sings the French part at the end .
In the May , 1995 issue of Mojo magazine , Stewart said : `` I was going out with Britt Ekland .
I 'd just moved here .
So that 's 20 years ago .
I remember I got her drunk , pissed as a fart to sing that old French bollocks on the end , because she did n't want to do it . ''
When asked if he paid her a royalty , Stewart replied , `` Bollocks !
I bought her a nice frock . ''
In 2003 , a musical called Tonight 's The Night opened in London .
The show featured Rod Stewart 's hits in much the same way as Abba 's show Mamma Mia !
and Billy Joel 's Movin ' Out .
Tonight 's The Night did n't do nearly as well ; it closed a year later .
