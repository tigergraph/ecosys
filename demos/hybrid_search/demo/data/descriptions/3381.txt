This is the opening track from English dance pop singer-songwriter Sophie Ellis-Bextor 's fourth studio album , Make a Scene .
Sophie told Digital Spy about the writing of the song : `` I wrote it with Greg Kurstin and Cathy Dennis and it was actually the quickest song to write on my whole album .
We started work at midday and Cathy had to leave by 4pm , and we even had time for some lunch outside in the garden , so it was probably about three hours ' work .
I think it sounds great - really fresh and quite heavy . ''
The tune references Ellis-Bextor 's 2001 hit single , `` Murder on the Dancefloor . ''
She told Digital Spy : `` It was n't my idea - I think I 'm too British to think of something like that - but Cathy suggested it and I really liked the idea .
I think it 's great if you 've been around a while to reference yourself . ''
