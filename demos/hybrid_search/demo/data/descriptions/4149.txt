Adam Young told AOL Music why he included this short interlude about the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on All Things Bright and Beautiful : `` It was a fun thing to do as a concept .
I knew I wanted a little bit of an intermission , kind of a little break in the middle of the record .
We used to play that little clip of Reagan addressing the country when the Challenger disaster happened in '86 live on tour then play some kind of ethereal , ambient music behind it .
I was actually born in that year , and my mom used to talk about being pregnant and watching that thing on TV and what a huge blow it was to everybody .
So growing up that was a part of who I was , indirectly .
On the record , I wanted to pay respect to that - just imagine what it would be like going into the next song , ` Galaxies , ' what it would be like if I were one of those guys on the Challenger .
Then it exploded , and I was taken from this life into eternity .
So it was fun to imagine beyond the confines of what actually happened and how disastrous that was . ''
