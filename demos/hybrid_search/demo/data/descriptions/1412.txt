This somber and contemplative track was written in memory of the wife of the band 's accountant , who passed away from stomach cancer during the recording of the album .
The song 's only lyrics , `` pursue happiness , with diligence , '' were her motto .
Drummer/vocalist Brann Dailor told Kerrang !
: `` It was one of the last things we recorded and it only really came together in the studio . ''
The acoustic driven song closes The Hunter .
Vocalist and bassist Troy Sanders told Kerrang !
: `` I think it 's a beautiful song that you can close your eyes to .
It 's nice to put a song at the end of the record that feels like an exhale .
Hopefully it allows you to absorb the ride you 've just been on . ''
