This was the second single to be released from Brooklyn born rapper Fabulous ' fifth studio album , Loso 's Way .
Fabolous explained this song to MTV News : `` It 's saying how long I been in the game and did things my way , and ` It 's My Time ' again .
That 's more what ` It 's My Time ' is about - for me to do my thing and wake people up to that . ''
Loso 's Way is a concept album , inspired by the 1993 Al Pacino movie Carlito 's Way .
Fabolous told MTV News : '' -LSB- My album -RSB- touches on so many issues from the movie , but it still -LSB- expresses -RSB- principles that people go through every day and could relate to .
That 's why I chose the movie .
I was watching the movie and was like , ` The stuff going on in this movie , everybody could relate to it . '
Just like how dude came out of jail and was like , ` I 'm not going back to jail . '
Everybody feels that way on the come-out .
It 's the journey to do something better .
When I was coming out of the ` hood , I felt I wanted to do something better , and -LSB- I put -RSB- the journey to do something better ... in this album .
A lot of things have happened -LSB- since my career started -RSB- .
I 've gotten shot , I 've got arrested , I 've had a baby .
All of these things have happened , so I wanted to put that in music form . ''
The song features the American R&B singer-songwriter Jeremih , who also co-wrote the track with Fabolous .
This song appeared in a TV ad for the NBA draft .
Fabolous explained to Billboard magazine that this song is an example of how his and Carlito 's stories coincide .
He said : `` This song is about how I generally feel about my life and my career , and it 's relatable to people because it 's the type of song that motivates you to do whatever it is you have to do , just like Carlito . ''
