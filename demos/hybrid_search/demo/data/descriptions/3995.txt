In this song the Big and Rich singer addresses the American government bail outs of automobile companies during the 2008-09 recession .
He explained to the Detroit Radio station WYCD that the inspiration for this song was the news reports of those who 've lost their jobs in the credit crunch .
Rich said : `` I 've been watching the news like everybody else .
I 'm sitting there , getting madder and madder , watching New York and Washington D.C. sling billions of dollars back and forth to each other while the hard-working people in America are just going , ` What in the world is going on up there ? ' ''
Rich explained to Billboard magazine : `` It was written as an outraged American , outraged at the government for giving massive sums of our money to people that misused it .
I think when you say , ` His pension plan 's been cut in half and he ca n't afford to die , ' that 's about as hard-core truth as it gets .
People are feeling that way all over .
As a tax-paying American I take offense to it .
As a country songwriter , I wrote a song about it ... and I used Detroit as the emblem for all hard-working Americans . ''
