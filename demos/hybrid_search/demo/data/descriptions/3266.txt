This is a tribute to Dana Wells , the stepson of Max Cavalera -LRB- formerly of Sepultura -RRB- , who was killed by a hit and run driver .
Dana was a friend of Deftones lead singer Chino Moreno .
Parts of Dana 's diary was used in the lyrics : `` Walk into this world with your head up high ! ''
Cavalera : `` The song we did together was very special .
They 'd lost a friend too .
When me and Chino recorded the vocals we were both on the floor and emotions were going everywhere .
It was almost as if we had Dana in the studio sitting between the two of us .
We were raging so hard , and I remember looking up and seeing Chino had smashed his nose and there was blood all over his face .
He had this expression on his face which said , ` How much more energy can you put into a song ! '
It was unbelievable !
When I put that song on I get goosebumps . ''
-LRB- thanks , Tim - Pittsburgh , PA , for above 3 -RRB- Max Cavalera helped write this , and named his band `` Soulfly '' after a line in this song .
