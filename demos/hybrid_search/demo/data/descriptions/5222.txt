Bowie wrote this as the theme to a musical version of George Orwell 's novel 1984 .
The musical never surfaced as the Orwell estate would not authorize it , but several of the songs found their way on to Diamond Dogs , most noticeably `` Big Brother '' and `` We Are The Dead . ''
This song 's Funk-inflected sound was indicative of where Bowie would head with his next album , Young Americans , during which he would hone the genre of `` plastic soul . ''
This is the only song on the album to feature guitar by Alan Parker instead of Bowie .
-LRB- thanks , Charlie - Stittstown , Canada , for above 2 -RRB- This was covered by Tina Turner for her 1984 comeback album Private Dancer .
It was produced by Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh of the British band Heaven 17 , who also helmed Turner 's hit cover of Al Green 's `` Let 's Stay Together . ''
Martyn Ware told us that it was he who suggested that Turner record the song as he thought she should do something contemporary .
He recalled : `` I said , ` Why do n't we do `` 1984 '' ? '
because this is in 1982 .
I thought , ` Very contemporary , ' right ?
It 's coming up .
It 's a topical subject .
It puts her right flat back in the middle and looking very , very cool and modern .
And I love the song anyway from Diamond Dogs , so that 's how we did it . ''
Turner recorded a duet with Bowie around the same time , which was the title track of his 1984 Tonight album .
