The lead single from Hurts ' second studio album Exile was premiered on BBC Radio 1 on January 4 , 2013 and was made available to download on iTunes from February 11 2013 in various European countries .
Hurts performed the song on TV for the first time during The Jonathan Ross Show on February 9 , 2013 .
Anderson told NME : `` I do n't think we 'd ever have written a song like ` Miracle ' a few years ago .
We made a first album , which we did n't ever think about playing live .
After two years we thought , ` God , would n't it be good if we had a song that did this , or this ?
You stock up on those ideas creatively .
So the songs are shaped by the kind of reaction you want to get you live . ''
The song is led by a riff but retains the melodic power of Hurts ' material from their debut album .
Keyboardist Adam Anderson described the writing of it in press materials as being similar to the creation of their third single from Happiness , `` Stay '' , where they instantly knew they were onto something special .
The song 's music video finds the Hurts duo surrounded by religious imagery as they journey through a post-apocalyptic shopping mall while dancers destroy a warehouse .
The clip was directed by Chris Turner and filmed in Colindale in North West London .
