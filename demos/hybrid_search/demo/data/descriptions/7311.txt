Girlfriend .
Boyfriend .
Wife .
Husband .
Other Half .
Better Half.All are `` titles '' bestowed upon couples when they are in a committed relationship .
So why is this song `` Untitled '' ?
O.A.R. lead singer Marc Roberge explains , `` When I was a freshman in college , I had a girl who was the high school girl type deal , right ?
And that ended badly , and a lot of great songs came out of it .
-LRB- laughs -RRB- So , this one is called ` Untitled ' because this person singing is no longer under the title of ` boyfriend , ' no longer under the title of ` better half ' or any of those titles that you are associated with .
It was kind of like this redemption , this guy 's breaking free , so he 's stripping himself of all these titles . ''
