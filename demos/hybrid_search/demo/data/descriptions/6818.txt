This love song , which Ringo co-wrote with Richard Marx , is a love song directed to his former model/actress wife Barbara Bach , who he 's been married to since 1981 .
There 's no secret to the couple 's longevity , Starr told USA Today .
`` I 'm just blessed that she puts up with me .
I love the woman .
She loves me .
There 's less down days than up , and we get on really well .
We do spend a lot of time together .
That 's the deal .
`` He added that not only is this song directed to her , `` but they 're all about her , really .
` Mystery of the Night ' is really interesting because I always feel it 's Andrew Lloyd Ringo - ` Mystreee of the Niiight ... ' - I ca n't help myself from going into that mode ! ''
