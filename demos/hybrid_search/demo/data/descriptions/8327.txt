This song describes a famous guy who is abusive to one woman and drives another to suicide , all the while claiming he is not to blame .
The likely inspiration is Jackson Browne , who Mitchell dated for a time .
Browne 's first wife Phyllis committed suicide in 1976 , and Daryl Hannah accused Browne of hitting her during their relationship .
Browne has vigorously denied the accusations , and no charges were filed .
