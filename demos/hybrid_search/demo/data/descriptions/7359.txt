This is the title track from the fourth studio album by the American indie rock duo Wavves .
The record is accurately titled as band member Stephen Pope is indeed afraid of heights .
The song features guest vocals by Jenny Lewis of Jenny & Johnny , the first time that the band had employed a female singer .
Having written the song and knowing that they needed a female voice to add to the mix , Wavves member Nathan Williams told Spinner that he took a look at his contact list and picked the first one he saw .
`` I opened my phone and Jenny Lewis ' name was the first one so I contacted her and she literally came in two days later , '' he explained .
`` We met her a few years ago on tour in Europe and we got along , hung out and then we played a show with her when she was in Jenny & Johnny and she brought us weed , which was very nice .
`` When we called her up to the studio , she brought us cookies - sea salt and chocolate chip cookies . ''
