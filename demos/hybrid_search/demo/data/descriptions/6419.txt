Lauper explained to The Sun newspaper July 25,2008 : `` Lyfe is for my son , not necessarily about him .
It 's more about how insane life can make you and really break you down .
There is a lot of s -- t going on in the US today that just outrages me , so it 's a nod to my family to stay strong - and also everyone around me . ''
Lauper clearly favors the Y over the I , which explains the alternate spelling in this song .
Her son is named Declyn , which is a variation on Declan , Elvis Costello 's real first name .
The Sun asked the 55-year-old '80s icon why she named the album Bring Ya to the Brink .
Lauper replied : `` Early on I was calling it Savoir Faire .
By the time I finished the CD I realized each song told a different story , like little pictures of life .
There is a lyric in the song Lyfe that says , ` Life it can break ya , it can make ya , it can bring ya to the brink . '
Meaning life 's experiences bring ya to the brink of all emotions and that 's what is exhilarating . ''
