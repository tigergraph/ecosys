Alt-J frontman Joe Newman recalls in this song a childhood bedtime ritual where his mum would lull him to sleep by making ocean noises .
The song ends with the lyric `` knee-deep on the North Sea , '' which is a reference to jazz outfit Portico Quartet 's Mercury Prize-nominated debut album .
Newman explained to NME : `` The title song -LRB- `` Knee-Deep in the North Sea '' -RRB- is the best song of the noughties .
They were such a huge influence . ''
Many fans have interpreted the line `` two tabs on your tongue '' to be about acid , but that is not the case .
Newman explained to NME that he , `` imagined a pill that you could take that would dissolve a memory of someone . ''
