A track from the Texas singer songwriter Hayes Carll 's third album , he wrote `` She Left Me for Jesus '' with the guitarist Brian Keane .
The song is about a libertine who loses his girl when she finds religion .
At the end of the song , he even threatens to kill Jesus if he ever sees him , as he blames the son of God for stealing his girl .
`` It 's not aimed at anyone 's religion , '' Carll said in our 2013 interview .
`` It 's aimed at intolerance and poking fun at somebody who calls himself a Christian and yet would beat up Jesus if he walked into a bar right now .
That was the idea behind it . ''
There were a few folks who did n't get the joke in this song , but most people were in on it .
`` We had a few random threats and I 've had people that did n't take it well , that did n't get it , '' Carll told us .
`` Jerry Falwell 's son , I think , wrote something about it .
But I 've had countless ministers and rabbis come up to me and say , ` I 'm a minister and the song 's hilarious to me . ' ''
