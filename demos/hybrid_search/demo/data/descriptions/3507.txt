Singer Emily Haines explained this song to Drowned in Sound : `` Imagine an apocalyptic Noah 's Ark transplanted to the Thunderdome , with animals of every stripe fighting for their lives for the entertainment of the human race .
We are at the point on this planet where the line between spectator and participant is not just blurred , it has disappeared completely .
Everything we do is part of the ` show , ' none of us have the option of sitting out a round .
The natural world used to be something we thought we could exploit for our pleasure forever but those days are gone .
The natural world is fighting back , and the natural world will win . ''
