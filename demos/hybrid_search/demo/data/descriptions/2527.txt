Written by Paisley along with songwriters Chris DuBois and Frank Rogers , this gut-wrenching song finds Paisley discovering an old camera with undeveloped pictures in it -LRB- this is before the proliferation of digital photography -RRB- .
This camera contains pictures of his lover who left him .
He considers developing them but changes his mind and says `` Who needs pictures with a memory like mine . ''
-LRB- thanks , Mark - Sarnia , ON -RRB-
