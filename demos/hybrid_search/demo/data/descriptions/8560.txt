Bassist Reenie Hollis recalled to Drowned in Sound : `` A lot of people say ` Giddy Stratospheres ' is our best song .
I 'd say it 's one of the strongest .
It 's a song we 've played live at every gig since we wrote it , and that 's probably the only song we 've ever done that with .
It might not have been a ` hit ' , but it 's one that 's essential to play from our point of view - our set was always built around it .
It 'd just feel extremely weird not to play it .
It 's been played at quite a few indie nights around the country , and I 'm not entirely sure why - I mean , have you tried dancing to it ?
The rhythm 's all over the place ! ''
