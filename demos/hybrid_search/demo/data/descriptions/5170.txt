This is a track from Weapons , the fifth studio album by the Welsh Alternative Rock band Lostprophets .
The record was released through Visible Noise in the UK and Epic in the US on April 2 , 2012 .
The song was inspired by a discussion that lead vocalist Ian Watkins was having with bass guitarist Stuart Richardson .
Watkins recalled to Kerrang !
: `` We were having a conversation on the bus one night and Stu - who always comes up with one-liners that I turn into song titles - said , ` if you bring a gun , we 'll bring an arsenal . ' ''
