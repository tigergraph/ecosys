Tim Rice-Oxley started this song in the back of the band 's touring bus on a boiling hot day in Boston in the summer of 2010 .
He explained : `` It was right after the show , and I was first on the bus so I cracked open a cold beer and picked up the guitar , and this spilled out straight away .
That 's my idea of heaven .
We were in Lincoln , Nebraska a couple of days later and everyone had gone off to get some rest in the hotel .
The tour bus was parked up outside for the day so I thought I would go on there and be able record the piano and vocal for the demo without disturbing anyone .
Anyway I was singing away merrily when I felt the bus pull away and before I knew it I was heading out of town - I ended up doing most of the demo outside a Walgreens in the back-end of nowhere .
I 'm not sure the bus driver ever realised I was on board . ''
Lyrically , the song considers the ease with which the idealistic youth can turn a bad situation around .
`` Forget the ghosts that make you old before your time , '' exhorts vocalist Tom Chaplin .
`` I like the idea of having to almost make a physical effort to get back on track sometimes , '' explained Rice-Oxley , `` if you get really low or things just are n't going right .
It 's a very sympathetic song , and I think it a good articulation of the human sympathy that is a big part of what ties the album together . ''
