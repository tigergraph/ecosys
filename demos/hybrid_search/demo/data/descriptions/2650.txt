Mike Norris of MTV News asked Oberst about the significance of the name `` Milk Thistle . ''
He replied : `` That 's an herbal supplement you take for liver protection .
That 's where it comes from .
It 's to promote liver health . ''
Oberst told The Sun newspaper August 1 , 2008 : `` I occasionally get worried about my physical constitution and I had a very sweet tour manager one day that showed up with a bottle of milk thistle .
He said : ` You 're fine but take this and it will help you stop worrying . '
I think it has a lot of healing qualities , particularly for the liver . ''
In the same MTV interview , Mike Norris asked if the lyric , `` If I go to heaven , I 'll be bored as hell , '' is an ongoing thing of not worrying about what happens next .
Oberst responded : `` Yeah , I guess the logical problem with the idea of heaven -LSB- is that -RSB- you ca n't really have infinite eternal goodness , 'cause you would n't understand it . ''
