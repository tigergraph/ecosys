This string quartet-led ballad was Weller 's attempt to write a modern `` Danny Boy . ''
He explained : `` I love the song ` Danny Boy . '
The lyrics are amazing .
I was after the same thing here .
It 's written from the perspective of a Scottish Lord in the 1800s waiting for his wayward son to come home .
He 's worried about him , but he still ca n't wait to be reunited .
I guess it 's something everyone can relate to in some shape or form . ''
