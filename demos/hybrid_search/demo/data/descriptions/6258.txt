To change things up on British alternative dance band Friendly Fire 's second album , the band incorporated several unusual recording techniques .
For this song , frontman Ed Macfarlane rang the bells of a St. Albans church and then sampled the results .
Macfarlane explained the song 's meaning to NME : `` This is about having feelings for someone but not being able to express them .
I like lyrics like that , just these really obvious universal pop subjects that are n't too complicated , they 're more accessible . ''
