This was written by Rudy Clark and originally recorded by James Ray in 1962 .
Harrison bought a copy of the single in the summer of 1963 when visiting his sister Louise in Illinois .
Many years later when he was writing his Cloud Nine album , he remembered the song and decided to cover it .
Harrison released another album earlier in 1987 called Gone Troppo , which flopped .
Proving that he could whip up a hit , he released this very simplistic cover song and it was a huge commercial success .
A lot of Harrison 's work was well off the mainstream , using unusual instruments and based on Indian music .
This proved that he could release a song requiring very little thought and send it up the charts .
Predictably , many of Harrison 's ardent followers ca n't stand this song .
The video shows Harrison surrounded by household objects that move on their own .
It helped market the song at a time when MTV was still playing a lot of videos .
Weird Al Yankovic did a parody of this called `` This Song 's Just 6 Words Long . ''
Cloud Nine was Harrison 's comeback album .
He had n't had a hit since 1981 with `` All Those Years Ago , '' and his previous US # 1 was `` Give Me Love -LRB- Give Me Peace On Earth -RRB- '' in 1973 .
Until the Beach Boys released `` Kokomo , '' Harrison had the record for longest span between # 1 hits .
`` Got My Mind Set On You , '' however , was his last single to chart .
ELO bandleader Jeff Lynne produced this song with Harrison .
His influence can be heard in the backing vocals of the chorus .
Along with Roy Orbison , Bob Dylan , and Tom Petty , Harrison and Lynne formed The Traveling Wilburys in 1988 .
When released as a single , this was backed with `` Lay His Head , '' which did not appear on the album .
This was the last song by a solo Beatle to hit # 1 in the US .
Harrison was also the first Beatle to hit # 1 - `` My Sweet Lord . ''
