This is a track from Catching A Tiger , the debut album by Illinois born folk rock artist Lissie Maurus , who records under the name of Lissie .
The title of the LP , which is a line from this song reflects how the singer-songwriter has gone about realizing her goals on her own terms .
After moving to Ojai , California , Lissie was visited by Band of Horses bassist Bill Reynolds , who produced her debut EP Why You Runnin .
This song was one of the first fruits of their sessions .
She explained to Spinner : `` We just started to work on songs and he played the four chords of ` Bully ' over and over again .
In five minutes I had all the words written .
It was almost like that song was me talking to a younger version of myself saying , ` These are the guidelines for like living a good life , realizing all the people that love you and that everything 's going to be fine .
Reach for things but do n't push them away because you reached too hard .
` It 's about trying to force these things that are difficult and being hard on yourself , you ca n't do it , '' she adds .
`` As an overall title , I thought it was good because trying to get your hands around something slippery .
It conjures up an image in someone 's head and they can apply it to whatever their tiger is . ''
