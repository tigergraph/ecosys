A # 1 Adult Contemporary hit for 5 weeks , Souther told us that Roy Orbison , who had a hit with `` Only The Lonely , '' was a big influence on this song .
Said Souther : `` I was a little kid when I first heard Roy Orbison , but he was magic .
He 's the guy that you turned out the lights and listened to his records by yourself - or with a girl - because he was just completely other-worldly .
He had sarcastic and adventurous songs and great arrangements , and then that beautiful , almost operatic voice .
Beautiful , natural deep echo on it .
He is one of half a dozen or so rockabilly musicians that I really loved .
When I was in junior high school was the first time I really started listening to that.But then I started playing drums all the time , and I got so fascinated with jazz , I did n't really think much about singing or making rock and roll records for quite a few years .
The first song I ever heard called ` Only the Lonely ' was this song that Frank Sinatra sang .
It 's a Johnny Mercer song ; it 's on a Sinatra album called Songs for Only the Lonely .
There are a lot of songs with that name .
But the beat that I used for ` You 're Only Lonely ' is that rockabilly beat .
That sort of break in it was taken from another Roy Orbison record called ` I 'm Hurtin '' that I really love . ''
