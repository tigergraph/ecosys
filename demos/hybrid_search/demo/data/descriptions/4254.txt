Vocalist Alison Mosshart and guitarist Jamie Hince were forced to write separately for The Kill 's fourth album , Blood Pressures because of Mosshart 's time touring with the Dead Weather .
This resulted in the singer penning tunes in a different way .
She told Billboard magazine this track came from learning by herself on the road .
`` I was trying to teach myself a different way of playing , of picking -LSB- guitar -RSB- .
I 'd never done that before , so that was my learning song ; that was the song I invented to learn how to do it quickly and play , '' she explained .
Despite the physical distance between them , Mosshart and Hince were still able to share the songs they were writing : `` The way we both write songs is we 're in the same place but we 're both in different rooms where we ca n't hear each other and writing at the same time , '' Mosshart told Spinner .
`` Then we meet up and play each other what we 're doing , and then there 's a response .
It did n't seem that weird to me writing in a hotel room halfway across the world because I would just see him and show him stuff when I saw him . ''
