In this song that deals with the pain of regret , McGraw 's woman has left him and left a half page note explaining why .
He finishes the note off , and writes a song `` like Kristofferson would do . ''
Tim McGraw explained To AOL why he recorded this song written by Reed Nielsen and Anthony Smith .
`` Kris Kristofferson is one of my heroes .
He 's one of the most talented songwriters that ever , ever put pen to paper and he 's also one of the coolest guys around .
I mean , my wife -LSB- Faith Hill -RSB- just swoons over him !
-LSB- laughs -RSB- So he 's just a great cool guy , and when the song came around I knew I wanted to record it ; plus it 's sort of tongue in cheek and it 's a lot of fun . ''
This track is similar to Taylor Swift 's `` Tim McGraw '' in being titled after a country star , without really paying much tribute to the person in the song .
We live in hope that Kris Kristofferson will complete the triangle by writing a song titled `` Taylor Swift ! ''
