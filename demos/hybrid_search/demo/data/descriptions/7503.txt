This song is a collaboration between Take That group members Gary Barlow and Mark Owen with producer Stuart Price .
Said Barlow on his website : `` This song is a Mark Owen special .
I left him with the backing track over night and he arrived with pretty much the finished thing !
Beautifully simple and hypnotic .
The vocals were also a lot of fun to do on this track .
Thanks to Stuart Price for the ever so '80s half time drum pattern . ''
The phrase `` wonderful world '' has cropped up on a number of occasions in song titles , including ones made famous by Sam Cooke and Louis Armstrong .
