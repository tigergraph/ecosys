The vocal on this song sounds just about as messy as the subject matter .
Deliberately so .
Singer Steve Adams had not been long in London when he wrote this song , and he was `` fully embracing as much of the night life as I possibly could at that time .
And that was just a reflection of my state of mind then . ''
Clearly.Not a song for family hour , but definitely a creative offering for anyone wondering what London 's night life is all about .
