This is the closing track on former Everything but the Girl singer Tracey Thorn 's third solo album , Love And Its Opposite .
`` I really wanted it to be the closing track , '' she said on her website .
`` It holds out hope for love 's survival even when it seems to be in hibernation . ''
CMU asked Thorn about the process she went through in creating a track for the album .
She replied : `` It varies .
This time around I started most of the tracks from scratch myself , either putting down a guitar or piano part , and then we added vocals and other instrumentation .
A couple of the tracks we started off with the rhythm section of Al Doyle and Leo Taylor , then built the other instruments on top .
But in the past I have often done collaborative tracks where someone else creates an electronic backing track which I then write vocal melody and lyrics for . ''
The song features Nashville singer-songwriter-drummer Cortney Tidwell on drums and backing vocals .
