This was the first song that front man Kevin Barnes wrote for False Priest .
However , after deciding it would be better served by a female singer , he offered the tune to his pal Beyonc√© 's younger sister Solange Knowles for her own album .
Barnes told Spin magazine : `` When I wrote a new song called ` Sex Karma , ' I thought it would be cool if it appeared on her record .
I sent it to her and for a while that was the plan .
But I really liked it and changed my mind , and we decided to record it as a duet .
Which works because the lyric ` You look like a playground to me , player , ' is funny for a guy to sing .
I did n't know if I could pull that off . ''
Barnes admitted he cribbed one of the lyrics from his young daughter , who coined the line , `` You look like a playground to me . ''
`` Yeah , I kind of stole that lyric from her , '' he said .
`` When she said it she was 3 .
Whenever she 's singing , I always listen because she comes up with some amazing ideas . ''
Barnes and Solange 's duet was inspired by one of the Of Montreal frontman 's favorite partnerships - the late - '60s collaborations between Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell .
`` The thing I love about Marvin and Tammi is that there 's a sort of feistiness between them , a sexual energy , but they 're always trying to restrain themselves , even though the chemistry is so great , '' Barnes told Spin .
`` Whenever I perform with Solange or Janelle -LSB- Monae , another collaborator on False Priest -RSB- , it 's that same sort of feeling , this excitement just to be onstage with them . ''
L.A. superproducer and film-music composer Jon Brion -LRB- Fiona Apple , Kanye West , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind -RRB- added a Mighty Wurlitzer , one of the biggest pipe organs in the world to this track .
`` We went to this church that had one , set up a bunch of mics , and -LSB- Brion -RSB- played all this crazy stuff on it , '' Barnes recalled .
`` It was a really magical experience . ''
