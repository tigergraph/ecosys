Vocalist Ann Wilson explained : `` It 's funny because when I first heard ` Hey You ' there were a few lines I thought I heard myself in .
I privately , secretly thought she 'd written a song about me .
Then I found out it was definitely about someone else .
So I told Nancy , and she then wrote ` Sunflower ' to try and write a song about me as a birthday gift .
She said , ` Here you go , here 's your present . '
And I still get tight in the throat when I hear this song . ''
