`` Here I Am '' is the opening track from the animated film Spirit : Stallion Of The Cimarron , which was released in 2002 .
The song introduces the film 's somewhat offbeat hero , the feisty stallion , and pays homage to the then yet untamed Wild West .
The sheet music is credited Words and Music by Bryan Adams , Gretchen Peters and Hans Zimmer , Arranged by Ed Lajeski , and was published by Cherry Lane Music , copyright 2002 by SKG Songs and Badams Music .
