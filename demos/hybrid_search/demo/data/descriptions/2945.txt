This song from the album of the same title was Anita Baker 's biggest hit , scoring # 1 on both the US Adult Contemporary and US R&B charts , in addition to # 3 on the Hot 100 .
So this became a broad crossover song , becoming a favorite of jazz , pop , and `` light '' radio stations all at the same time .
Grammy-winning songwriter Skip Scarborough is the primary writer for this song .
He originally shopped it around but was turned down by many artists , including jazz and R&B singer Howard Hewett .
Baker took it and added some detail at the beginning and had the tempo sped up , producing the peppier version with the mixed writing credit .
The album Giving You The Best That I Got garnered Baker three Grammy Awards and three Soul Train Music Awards .
As if that were n't enough , it also made Billboard 's # 1 album spot for December 24 , 1988 through January 20 , 1989 .
