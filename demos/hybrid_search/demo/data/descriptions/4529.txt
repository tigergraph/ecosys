This was written by Rod Temperton , formerly a member of Disco group Heatwave .
Jackson 's producer , Quincy Jones , convinced Temperton to write some songs for Jackson .
The original title was `` I Want To Eat You Up , '' but it was quickly changed to fit Jackson 's image .
This song was part of the soundtrack for the video game Michael Jackson : The Experience .
That was the 2010 game which hearkened back to his Moonwalker phase -LRB- you can see it right on the cover art -RRB- , and hence to the 1989 arcade game Michael Jackson 's Moonwalker .
And hoo-boy , we just gave every old-skool MJ fan a nostalgia flush !
This was the first song Rod Temperton wrote for Jackson .
He would write many others for him , including `` Off The Wall '' and `` Thriller . ''
This was Michael Jackson 's third # 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 ; the first two were `` Ben , '' and `` Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough . ''
Especially when you watch the video , it dawns on you that this was a Disco song ... in 1979 , when Disco was supposed to be sleeping with the fishes -LRB- it would n't be right to say ` deader than disco ' -RRB- .
In fact , it even has some Soul overtones .
Jackson was well-suited for the dance beats of Disco , and was able to work in the genre when it was well past its prime.You 'll also find the video in the collections Video Greatest Hits - HIStory , Number Ones and Michael Jackson 's Vision .
