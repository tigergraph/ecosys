This desperate cry out to God is the second single from American Contemporary Christian band Casting Crown 's fourth studio album , Until The Whole World Hears .
Lead vocalist Mark Hall explained how God inspired the song : `` I 'd been trying to write all day , but I felt like I was tying words in knots .
I went to bed , could n't sleep , was up and down , until about 2:30 in the morning .
My wife , Melanie , sat up in the bed and said , ` You just need to say , Speak , Lord , for your servant hears ! '
And then she rolled over and went back to sleep !
`` Hall added , laughing , `` I was a little ill about that comment but I knew she was right , so I went downstairs to the piano .
That 's when I realized I 'd been humming a tune in my head for hours .
So I pounded out the chords and the first verse just poured out .
That 's when you know it 's bigger than you ; when you know you did n't come up with the lyric .
I 'm not that creative !
When God whispers in my ear - that 's a ` God line . ' ''
