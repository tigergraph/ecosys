This rumination on the state of the planet is a track from English crossover jazz singer-songwriter Jamie Cullum 's fourth studio album , The Pursuit .
Cullum told the story of the song in publicity materials : `` I was driving along one day in January when the Credit Crunch was just starting to bite and the weather was terrible .
This line came to me : ` The wheels are falling off the world . '
I wrote it down and did n't really do anything with it .
Then a friend brought his four-year-old over to mine and he was showing me an exercise they teach you when you first learn to play piano -- rolling your knuckles over the black notes .
Suddenly it all connected in my head .
This song uses the same notes and construction that that four-year-old showed me !
It 's about the clarity you get when you 're drunk and out on the town .
It 's about trying to get that back when you 're sober . ''
