This was released as the lead singer from A Fine Frenzy 's third album , Pines .
Sole A Fine Frenzy member Alison Sudol explained in an interview with Anthropologie : `` The entire record is a story , and each song is a chapter that leads into the next .
It 's the first time I 've done anything like it .
We recorded the album live , which was incredibly freeing .
You can feel the room , the instruments , the breathing , my foot on the piano pedal .
You can hear all the bumps and creaks of my voice - not perfect at all , but human and real . ''
The song is both the penultimate track on Pines and also its most upbeat cut .
Sudol explained to Billboard magazine : `` Initially ` It 's Alive ' was kind of the peak of the record .
It was kind of the big moment - and yet that song is a little bit laidback .
And I wanted there to be just an explosive , happy moment on the record .
That 's where ` Now Is the Start ' came in . ''
