This was released as the first single from the eponymous sophomore album by Australian indie-rockers , Temper Trap .
Bassist Jonathon Aherne told Alternative Addiction that both the band and record labels felt confident in choosing it as the first single .
`` The labels in the states were pretty adamant that it should definitely be the first single and it felt right to choose that as the first single , '' he said .
`` It would be difficult to go back to that song because musically speaking , it 's probably one of the more upbeat and bright songs while the rest of the tracks have a little bit more of a serious tone so I 'm glad we chose it . ''
The Dugan O'Neill directed video 's concept was inspired by the 1984 movie , The Karate Kid .
The band quickly agreed to proceed with O'Neill 's scenario as soon as they learned of his vision for the clip .
`` We as a band argue over a lot of things and fine tune every detail , '' Aherne told Alternative Addiction , `` but as soon as we saw it was sort of based off The Karate Kid and the redemption of Johnny , you know the bully of the story ... there was n't even a blink of an eye , we knew we had to go for it .
We 're just really excited about it . ''
