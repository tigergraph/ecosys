Drummer/vocalist Brann Dailor explained the song title to Kerrang !
: `` The main riff reminded us of an octopus because you need about eight tentacles to play it - so that 's why the song is about an octopus . ''
Vocalist and bassist Troy Sanders told Kerrang !
: `` There 's a line in the chorus that goes , ` I 'm on my way back home . '
That 's important to this band because it 's what we always say when we get towards the end of a tour .
It 's always an important moment . ''
