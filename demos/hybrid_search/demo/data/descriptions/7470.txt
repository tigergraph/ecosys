This song is about Tegan and Sara 's parents ' divorce .
It is the first time that the twins have broached the subject in a song .
A number of songs on Sainthood examine the theme of exemplary behavior in the pursuit of love and relationships , inspired in part by the ending of Sara 's long-term relationship .
She told The Los Angeles Times : `` Getting out of a long relationship shook me to my core .
You can be so committed to something and yet it still does n't work .
I think if we knew how things were going to end , most people would n't get involved , but love is throwing caution to the wind .
All of the songs touch on that . ''
