The 1975 frontman Matt Healy was still living with his parents until late 2012 when the band took off and his parents got divorced .
He wrote this soft , contemplative piano ballad about finally moving away from home .
Healy explained to The Guardian : `` December of last year I went on tour and they sold that house .
I went home for two days to move out of my house , and I wrote and recorded ` Is There Somebody Who Can Watch You , ' the last song on the album , about that moment .
So I left and I 've not really been home since . ''
