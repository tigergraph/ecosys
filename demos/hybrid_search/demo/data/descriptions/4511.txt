This was the opening track on American alternative rock group Wilco 's seventh studio album , Wilco -LRB- The Album -RRB- .
This song features the chorus `` Wilco will love you . ''
Frontman Jeff Tweedy explained to Rolling Stone : `` My records have loved me .
Not my own records , but music .
It 's silly to say , but I think it 's very real . ''
Much of Wilco The Album was recorded in January 2009 in New Zealand after the majority of the band recorded with Kiwi Neil Finn for an Oxfam benefit album .
They got such a great vibe from Finn 's Roundhead studio in Auckland that they extended their stay in Auckland and continued to work there .
The album was produced by the band and producer/engineer/mixer Jim Scott -LRB- he also served as the mixing engineer on Summerteeth , Sky Blue Sky and Being There -RRB- and additional sessions at the band 's Chicago studio the Loft followed .
Tweedy explained to Rolling Stone : `` We wanted to use the studio more , to create more of an artifact than a document . ''
Wilco -LRB- The Album -RRB- peaked at # 4 in the US album charts , a career best for the band .
Wilco premiered this humorous , self-referential rocker in 2008 on The Colbert Report .
Other artists who have penned songs sharing their moniker include Madness -LRB- whose `` Madness '' was the b-side of their debut single -LRB- `` The Prince '' -RRB- , Motorhead -LRB- the title track and opener of their debut 1977 Motorhead album , S'Express -LRB- check out their UK # 1 hit `` Theme From S'Express '' -RRB- and , er , British pop group S Club 7 -LRB- well , `` S Club Party '' was a # 2 hit in the UK in 1999 ! -RRB- .
The camel on the album sleeve is called Alfred .
Tweedy explained why the band put a camel on the cover to The Independent newspaper December 11 , 2009 : `` Originally , we thought of having a really old man having a birthday party but once we found the camel it became painfully obvious that the party should be for him .
I wanted someone to look at the image and go , ` What the hell is that ?
How did that happen , and why was n't I invited ? ' ''
