When Ke $ ha 's frequent collaborator Dr. Luke first gave fans a sneak peek of this song , in which she praises a lover 's prowess , the singer took to her Twitter account to mock-reprimand her producer , writing : `` You leaked my song about me having sexy time with a ghost , @thedoctorluke .
Now everyone knows I get it on with ghosts ! ''
It turns out that rather than literally being about getting it on with Casper , Ke $ ha is singing about some experiences she had with the supernatural , but in an erotic way .
She explained to NME : `` It happened when I was living in this flophouse in Laurel Canyon .
I 've always been open to the supernatural and in this house , it was really obvious there was something going on .
It got more and more intense over the course of the year .
It started waking me up at night .
I found a snake under my pillow .
I used to get woken up at 3am with crazy shadows on the walls , outlines of men .
It was a really dark , sexual thing happening there . ''
The song contains a portion of the composition `` Would n't It Be Good , '' which was the only Hot 100 hit for the English singer-songwriter Nik Kershaw , peaking at # 46 in 1984 .
He did better in his home country , achieving seven UK Top 20 hits in the 1980s as a solo artist .
Kershaw later became a songwriter penning tunes for the likes of Chesney Hawkes -LRB- `` The One and Only '' -RRB- and The Hollies -LRB- `` The Woman I Love '' -RRB- .
