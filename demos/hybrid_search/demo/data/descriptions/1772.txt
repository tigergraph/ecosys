American singer-songwriter and producer Chris Willis started out as a gospel singer doing backup vocals for the likes of Dolly Parton and Amy Grant before getting international attention for his collaborations with house music artist David Guetta .
This was released as his first solo single .
The single topped Billboard 's Hot Dance Club Songs and also peaked at # 27 in the Netherlands .
Willis co-wrote the song with the Danish duo of Jonas Jeberg and Cutfather -LRB- Kylie Minogue , Pussycat Dolls -RRB- .
We asked Willis in a 2012 interview whether he normally goes straight to the chorus when he 's writing a song , or if he structures it by verses first ?
He replied : `` I normally try to focus on the chorus first .
It does n't always work , but that 's generally what I try to do .
I build the chorus and build the hook - the part that I think people are going to remember the most .
Then , I do a treatment lyrically on the verses that kind of compliments the chorus .
There are times when the verses come first and kind of flow through to the chorus , but that 's the way I do it . ''
