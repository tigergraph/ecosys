During his Sermon on the Mount , Jesus referred to his Church as a city on a hill that can not be hidden , a beacon of light and truth to the world .
Frontman Mark Hall told NewReleaseTuesday this song , `` draws a picture of two old men sitting and talking about the city on the hill . ''
He explained : `` They 're trying to remember what happened to the city on the hill because it 's not there anymore .
As they weave through the stories , they remember the warriors thought everyone was weak so they went off and started their own city .
The dancers did n't think everyone had enough spirit so they went off and started their own city .
It 's an allegory of the factions of the modern Church , the result of predominantly like-minded people often dwelling upon non-essentials and personal taste to go their own direction . ''
Hall was inspired by the passage in 1 Corinthians 12 , which describes the church as a body , a unit that is made up of many parts .
He explained to New Release Tuesday : `` The Apostle Paul recognized the differences in us all -- some of us are a hand , some are a foot , some an eye -- but we all serve a distinct and important purpose and are interdependent .
We have to dwell on our like-mindedness if we are ever going forge a lasting impact for God 's Kingdom .
The song reminds us that we really do complete each other in the kingdom when we come together . ''
