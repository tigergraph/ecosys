This is a true song about Clarkson 's ex boyfriend , who broke up with her and got married a month later .
The song is about being hurt by someone you were once close to .
The video is based heavily on Clarkson 's own personal experiences .
She is credited with the concept and ideas behind it ; it was directed by Joseph Kahn .
The video did very well on MTV 's TRL , becoming a regular # 1 request .
Finally , fifty days later , on August 3 , 2005 , the video was retired from the Top 10 countdown .
Clarkson holds the record for the longest stay by a female at # 1 with 33 days , nearly surpassing the record previously set by The Backstreet Boys .
-LRB- thanks , Donovan Berry - El Dorado , AR -RRB- The song almost did n't make it to the album .
