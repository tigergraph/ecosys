The third song in Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy 's `` Twelve-step Suite , '' this song covers steps 6 and 7 in the Alcoholics Anonymous recovery program .
In 2010 , Portnoy told us about how alcoholism almost killed him : `` If you listen to all five of these songs , there 's so much stuff that I wrote about that 's taken directly out of AA meetings , or taken directly out of the Big Book -LRB- the Alcoholics Anonymous guidebook -RRB- .
That was a big part of what was behind the songs , and what 's behind me still being alive today .
It 's all about bettering yourself and it 's not only a program of learning to be sober , it 's a program of learning to live to be a better human being .
That 's why it 's been a huge , huge help and a big part of my life for the last 10 years . ''
