Killers frontman Brandon Flowers explained to ShortList that the English comedian Jimmy Carr suggested the economic theme behind this song .
`` I was having dinner with Jimmy Carr , like you do , and he thought the next big breakthrough record that people were going to notice was going to be about the problems of the economy , '' he told the magazine.Flowers added , regarding how he became friends with Carr : `` We played Comic Relief and he was there , I struck up conversation and he 's great .
When he comes to Vegas we see him , and here in London .
We were talking about Bruce Springsteen or something , we thought that somebody was going to make a record like that . ''
Flowers recalled during a track by track with Spotify : `` That made it onto the record at the last moment !
It comes from a Bob Seger song called ` Against The Wind ' - it 's one of the best songs ever written - and the words just came out of me as I sang .
It has a very special feel to it . ''
