This is the first single released by London-based grime artist Wiley after signing a four-album major label deal with Island Records , home to Tinchy Stryder & Taio Cruz .
The song is a collaboration with producer Chew Fu and his fellow dub step producer Harry Seaman .
Wiley told the Daily Mirror January 1 , 2010 that the title is a tribute to a certain famous BRIT-award winning pop band : `` I was playing in a club and did n't know Take That were rehearsing in an aircraft hangar nearby , '' Wiley explained .
`` Mark Owen popped in for cigarettes and when I was writing the song , that popped back into my mind .
I 've got respect for any performer who fulfills their dreams . ''
