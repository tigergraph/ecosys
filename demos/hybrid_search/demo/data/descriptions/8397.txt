This song was intended for a follow-up album to Harrison 's successful Cloud 9 album from 1987 .
George and co-producer Jeff Lynne -LRB- along with their new pal Tom Petty -RRB- were cutting tracks for this unnamed album when they went to California to record with some of their friends .
It was then when George decided to shelve the idea of another solo album for the Traveling Willburys project .
He gave the solo tracks already cut to Warner Brothers for use on a `` Best Of '' album , which had tracks from his other Dark Horse/Warner Brothers albums .
This was used in the closing credits of the movie Lethal Weapon 2 .
-LRB- thanks , Ken - Louisville , KY , for above 2 -RRB-
