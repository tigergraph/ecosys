This is a modern re-invention of the religious song `` One Day , '' which is one of the hymns that Mark Hall grew up with .
The Casting Crowns frontman and songwriter told Billboard magazine that he enjoyed experimenting with the classics .
`` You can really do a lot of cool things when you are rearranging hymns , '' he said .
`` With the song ` One Day ' and ` Blessed Redeemer , ' those are songs that people are n't going to sing much anymore , but those lyrics are strong .
I grew up with the hymnbook .
That 's all I knew , so it 's cool to bring them back . ''
The words of `` One Day '' were written by the Presbyterian evangelist John Wilbur Chapman -LRB- 1859-1918 -RRB- in around 1908 .
Bassist Chris Huffman told Billboard magazine about this modern take on the classic hymn : `` That song is basically about the life of Jesus .
When you have a song like that where you do n't really sing about any of your own troubles , you are just singing every word about Jesus , people 's hands go up and it 's amazing to see everybody 's reaction when you play it live . ''
