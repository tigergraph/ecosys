Dr Dee is an opera scored by Damon Albarn .
The work combines Elizabethan English instruments with acoustic guitar and harmonium played by the Blur frontman and drums performed by Nigerian percussionist Tony Allen .
It also features a twenty-piece orchestra , which was provided by the BBC Philharmonic and conducted by Andr√© de Ridder .
In addition , this song features the West African stringed instrument , the kora , which is played by Malian Madou Diabate .
On the face of it , the opera is based on the life of mathematician and occultist John Dee , who was an advisor to Elizabeth I. However , the work is not entirely set in the Elizabethan era .
Albarn explained to The Sun : `` I 'm in a strange world with it .
It 's not Elizabethan .
The album is informed by my fascination with that era but it feels to me like it 's still very much in the modern world .
I do n't think I would have been able to sing about my country or Queen without having this extraordinary man John Dee to help frame my thoughts .
He enabled me to address my relationship with England . ''
