A track from Jars of Clay 's first album , `` Love Song For A Savior '' is a worship song about a young girl delighting the gifts of nature .
It 's one of the few Jars of Clay songs with direct references to God and the Christian church - something lead singer Dan Haseltine tells us is an important aspect of their lives , but not the only thing they sing about .
`` We do this because we feel like our voice and our observations about the world are worth speaking about , and it 's our way of organizing our own life , our own existence , '' he said in our 2013 interview .
`` This is our therapy in ways . ''
In 2013 , this song was featured in commercials for the online dating service Christian Mingle .
Using a worship song for commercial purposes caused a bit of controversy , but Dan Haseltine has no problem with it .
He told us : `` We have always believed that we 're writing songs that are n't just going to sit in our vault and be what we listen to .
We have to be ready for letting other people interpret them differently and let them have different meanings for different people .
That 's the great thing about art , is that it 's open to interpretation .
I know that there is some controversy surrounding that and people who would say , ` We ca n't believe that they would take a song that was meant to be about God and turn it into a person . '
I tend to think that we care so deeply about our personal relationships that if they want to use it that way , we 're happy that they did .
So it does n't bother us that it gets pulled out of context that way . ''
