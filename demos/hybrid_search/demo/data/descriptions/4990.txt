Speaking of `` Hot Knives '' to Lazy-I 's Tim McMahan , Oberst said that his songs are n't always autobiographical .
Some , like this one , are drawn from images from the world around him , overheard discussions , or minor glimpses into people 's lives .
`` Hot Knives '' is an anthemic rock song with Bright Eyes ' usual dark twist .
The song employs a common tactic of Conor Oberst 's songwriting : a dystopic tale of Americana told from the perspective of a particular character .
The subject of the song is a woman , but , but Oberst uses her perspective to give voice to the complications of love and sex .
Oberst told McMahan that the song is `` about an average wife , a mother character who realized that her husband has been unfaithful to her .
She goes through this metamorphosis where she has sex with a lot of people , does drugs , lives the nightlife , and eventually realizes she has to let go of her ego or what was hurting her and start a new life and shed her old existence . ''
The song appeared on Bright Eyes ' 2007 album , Cassadega , and was the second single released from that record .
Cassadega is named after a town in Florida inhabited by spiritualists and mediums .
Reactions were split on the album , with some critics praising the band 's interesting new direction , with others feeling that the increasing distance from the band 's original sound was the mark of a musical act losing its way .
A live recording of the song was also released as a single in 2007 , paired with a concert take of `` If the Brakeman Turns My Way . ''
The lyrics are about a woman who slips into a new sort of existence filled with fast times and wild adventures , until at last she realizes that she has to let go of her idea of who she is completely and undergo a spiritual rebirth .
Bright Eyes played the song at their appearance on Late Show with David Letterman in July of 2007 .
