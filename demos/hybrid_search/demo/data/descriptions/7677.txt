Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls wrote this song .
She explains that it 's not based on a specific event : `` it 's sort of a metaphor for what we can experience socially and how it can wear us down , and there 's so much stimuli and we 're so attached to our past or whatever it is that 's holding us down .
That song kind of has a world-weariness about it , definitely .
More so than any song I 've ever written .
Sometimes if you go to a party and you look around and you see posing , or people professing this or that ... if you take a look at the whole thing , it just can sort of be overwhelming , what human begins are going though .
And there 's always a party , it 's like if people are drinking and there 's like a buzz in the air , and things are heightened .
It was just sort of a metaphor for how life can become like that , and become tiresome because of our patterns and our complexities - you want that one person that you trust implicitly that you can just put your head on his or her shoulder , and feel okay in all the madness . ''
