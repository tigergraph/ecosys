The Soft Rock singer-songwriter Robbie Dupree started singing on Brooklyn street corners in the early 1960s .
He spent the early part of the 1970s playing with a number of bands such as The Striders , Small Fortune , and New World Rising , the last of which also featured Nile Rodgers , who would go on to find fame with Chic .
Dupree 's first recognition came in 1976 , when his song `` When You 're Down '' received the American Songwriting Festival Award for ` Best Rhythm & Blues Song ' .
Dupree moved to LA in 1978 and in 1980 , signed a contract with Elektra Records .
The same year he released his debut self-titled album , which yielded this song about two lovers stealing away into the night as well as the Top 20 single `` Hot Road Hearts . ''
Elektra dropped Dupree in the middle of recording his third album , as they felt his West Coast sound was outdated .
`` Like all lame corporate companies , '' he later commented to Rock United .
`` They chased the New Wave . ''
Dupree admitted to Ringside Report that he was uncomfortable filming the song 's music video : `` Remember we made that video before MTV and were part of the first wave of artists who were making videos , '' he said .
`` Nobody knew how to react to it .
For example , you are lip synching which is ridiculous .
The label at the time insisted on the ridiculous scripts they had like you are playing a gig there is a girl and the usual stuff .
As videos got more efficient in the years to come , where they were doing multi-camera shots and were like mini movies artists got comfortable with the medium .
It was uncharted territory for me and I never cared for it much . ''
This song featured on the soundtrack of the 2009 Jim Carrey movie I Love You Phillip Morris .
