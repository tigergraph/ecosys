Randy Newman was awarded the 2011 Best Song Oscar for this song , which he composed for Toy Story 3 .
The singer-songwriter also earned an Academy Award in 2002 for his original song `` If I Did n't Have You , '' from the animated film Monsters , Inc. .
Newman noted that this is only his second Oscar win despite receiving twenty nominations over the years .
There were only 4 songs nominated for the award in 2011 , prompting Newman to joke , `` cinematography has five , what , they could n't find a fifth song ? ''
, before delivering the punch line that if there had been a fifth contender they 'd most certainly have beaten him .
Speaking with reporters after the ceremony , Newman continued to be in self-depreciating mood calling the song `` not the most consequential '' piece of music he has composed for a film .
He added that he felt his music for previous films such as A Bug 's Life , Toy Story 2 , The Natural , Ragtime and , Awakenings had much more impact on the movie 's atmosphere .
