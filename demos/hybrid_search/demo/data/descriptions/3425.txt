Between The Shins 2007 release Wincing The Night Away and its follow-up Port of Morrow , the band 's frontman , James Mercer , became a father to two daughters .
This steel guitar decorated track hints at the transformative impact of children upon carefree life as he reflects on their unquestioning affection -- `` I 've got a good side to me as well , and it 's that she loves , '' Mercer croons .
The Shins singer told Q magazine how his new role as a parent influenced some of the lyrics for the Port of Morrow album .
Said Mercer : `` When you love something like that , something as fragile as a child , it completely changes you and your thinking , You just have this joy , you know ? ''
