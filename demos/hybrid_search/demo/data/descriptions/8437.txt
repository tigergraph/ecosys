This was one of the first songs that guitarist Joe King wrote after the release of The Fray 's eponymous second album .
He shopped it around to various artists including Faith Hill , who was enthusiastic , but her whole recording project fell through .
Kris Allen was also interested but eventually passed on the song .
When Scars & Stories producer Brendan O'Brien heard it , he persuaded the band to record it themselves for the album .
Another King song , `` Alright with Me '' , did end up on Kris Allen 's eponymous debut album .
Commenting on his working with the American Idol winner , King said that there `` a very good vibe in the studio .
There was no pressure . ''
Initially Fray singer Isaac Slade could n't catch the vision for the song , so left it to King .
When it returned to the band he took another stab at putting his own story into it -- this time successfully .
He explained to Denver Westword : `` I was kind of assessing the damage with my girl and with my main relationships , and just sort of having an honest appraisal of like , ` What was it like to be friends with me , when I was this total dancing-around-make-everybody-like-me man ? '
It 's hard to talk about .
I love that image , that ' I can hardly get this out , but I 'm sorry , just so you know . '
I sort of put all of my relationships into that song - my marriage , my family , my friends .
A lot has changed over the past seven years-eight years - ten years of being in this band .
I tried so hard to make everybody happy and like me , and I failed so miserably and finally just gave up .
But in the process of that giving up , there 's a lot of heartache .
It was really cathartic writing that song . ''
