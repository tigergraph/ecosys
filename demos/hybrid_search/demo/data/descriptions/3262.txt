This is a Jazz-Rock tribute to John Coltrane 's late widow and Jazz pianist Alice Coltrane , who died in January 2007 .
Paul Weller explained : `` I 'm a big fan of hers , and her old man , of course .
It was terrible news when she passed away last year .
It 's a nod to her .
There are a few stylistic references - the arpeggiated piano flourishes and the harp , obviously , and there 's some tambura in there . ''
Among the 12 Must-Have CDs that Paul Weller once listed was Alice Coltrane 's 1970 album Journey in Satchidananda .
Weller said of it : '' It follows what -LSB- her husband -RSB- John was doing toward the end of his life , exploring Eastern scales and North African sounds and the Indian modal thing .
A really beautiful record . ''
He also included in his must-have list John Coltrane 's 1964 A Love Supreme album .
This features Robert Wyatt on trumpet .
The former Soft Machine band member once described Weller 's psychedelic Folk-Rock sound of the 1990s as `` new furniture seasoned from old wood . ''
Wyatt told Mojo magazine June 2008 , that on this track he wanted to get '' that feeling of spontaneous invention that Jazz had . ''
