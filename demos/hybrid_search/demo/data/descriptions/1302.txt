This song is about the fleeting nature of Pop-Idol-style fame and the way that winners of TV talent shows after thinking they have become superstars have to deal with the disillusionment that comes with realizing the truth .
Just Jack was particularly thinking of Michelle McManus , the Scottish singer who won Pop Idol and then saw her career founder after an initial flurry of chart-topping success .
The track has been used without any apparent irony on a number of reality TV shows .
In the Daily Mail , April 13 , 2007 , Just Jack said : `` The song is about the celebrity machine .
When Michelle McManus won Pop Idol , everyone was saying it was great , because she had won because of her voice and was n't being penalized for the fact she was a big girl .
Then , just a few weeks later , there were lots of unflattering photographs of her in a swimsuit in Heat magazine .
She went from being celebrated to being ridiculed in a really short space of time .
It 's a cautionary tale , telling people to be careful of believing in TV . ''
