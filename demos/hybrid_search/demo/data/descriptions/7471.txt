This ballad is the only track on Clancy 's Tavern that Keith wrote on his own .
He said : `` It 's one of my favorite things I have written by myself in the last couple years .
I actually said one day in a conversation : ` do n't expect too much from me and I wo n't let you down , ' and I thought that it needed to be a song title .
I wrote about two lonely rebels , a boy and a girl , finally falling in love .
And the guy says : ' I ai n't got a pot of gold , I ai n't even got a rainbow , but I 've heard that love is where treasure can be found , do n't expect too much from me and I wo n't let you down . '
Kind of a first take for the two rebels who let their hearts go . ''
Many of Keith 's generation will feel the male protagonist is a character familiar to them .
He told Reuters : `` My father had a lot of similar traits , but it is really about that generation .
A lot of people come up to me and say ` That 's my dad , that 's my old man . '
This guy is a kid at heart , probably around 30 .
He 's met some girls in the past who he thought were right and it did n't work out , and he knows it was probably his fault .
Now he 's found someone who thinks she can change him and he 's OK with that .
The guy decides to be up-front with the girl , so he tells her ` Look , I love you and you love me , but I might not be capable of a relationship . ' ''
Keith originally penned this for 2010 's Bullets in the Gun but held it back as he considered it `` was such a good ballad . ''
