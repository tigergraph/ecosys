This synth-pop ballad finds Bon Iver leader Justin Vernon dreaming of a burial place for strangers near Jerusalem being relocated in the heart of Texas .
He explained the story behind the song to UK newspaper The Sun : `` When I was working on the lyrics I was coming up with these images of the desert .
I had the idea of taking Hinnom , a place near Jerusalem where they have a cemetery for people who do n't have names and plopping it into Texas .
The song became an amalgamation of this idea and my experience of a Lucinda Williams song ` Fruits Of My Labor . '
She sings this line , 'Cause I finally did it , baby , I got out of La Grange , go in my Mercury and drove out west .
` She 's actually explaining the end of something , which is actually the beginning of her life .
When Lucinda got into the Mercury and drove out west , she was burying the stranger inside her .
It 's a metaphor for a lot of stuff on the record . ''
