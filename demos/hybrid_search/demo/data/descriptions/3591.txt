The original song was on Justin 's second album FutureSex/LoveSounds , but the remixed duet with Beyoncé is included on a deluxe edition of the record .
This duet version was released as a single as a result of WGCI in Chicago playing Justin Timberlake 's original version , prompting his record label to start promoting the single at urban radio stations across the country .
It was then decided to remix the single , this time as a duet with Beyoncé , and shoot a video .
The chart success of this song meant that Justin Timberlake became the first solo artist this decade to have 6 Top-40 Hot 100 hits from one album .
The previous time a solo artist achieved this was Shania Twain , who lifted 6 Top-40 singles from her Come On Over album between 1997-99 .
Michael Jackson 's Dangerous album , which spawned 6 Top-40 hits between 1991-93 , was the last album by a solo male artist to reach the same heights .
Timbaland co-wrote and co-produced this song .
The previous time Beyoncé and Timbaland collaborated was on the Destiny 's Child # 15 UK hit `` Get On The Bus '' back in 1999 .
The song 's video is a live performance from Timberlake 's FutureSex/LoveShow .
