This is a track from House Of Gold And Bones : Part 2 , the second half of a double concept album about a character called The Human who wakes up in a mysterious world .
The main riff for the song came to frontman Corey Taylor by accident .
He recalled to Artist Direct : `` That came from mis-fretting an e-major chord .
My finger was clear up on the b-string .
I lifted it and came back to the g-string , and I was like , `` That 's cool as s -- t ! ''
I did it again , and that 's how I get the riff for ` The Uncanny Valley . ' ''
