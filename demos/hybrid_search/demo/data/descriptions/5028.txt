This is a track from American Heavy Metal band Korn 's ninth studio album , Korn III : Remember Who You Are .
Singer and lyricist Jonathan Davis dug deep for this cut .
He said : `` A lot of people dwell on the past , and they feel guilt .
There 's nothing you can do about the past because it 's gone and it 's blown up .
We 're here now . ''
During an interview with Artist Direct , Davis was asked if there is a lyric on Korn III : Remember Who You Are that he is particularly proud of .
The singer and lyricist replied : `` One that stands out is , ` Love without affection is like hate without the pain .
Life is a connection separate from the brain . '
I like that one .
When I do lyrics , every song is done in like a half-hour .
When I write , I just let it flow .
It f -- king comes out , and I do it .
I do n't second-guess it .
I do n't spend time sitting there and trying to make it better or anything ; that 's why I think it 's so real .
The s -- t flows out , and I let it go .
It 's stream-of-consciousness , and it 's simply real .
I remember Ross -LRB- Robinson , producer -RRB- saying he was so happy that I trusted myself to put down what was coming out of my head on paper , and there 's no one singing it .
A lot of other vocalists spend hours and days on lyrics just rewriting and rewriting trying to be so f -- king poetic -- that 's not me .
I try to get my point across in my own way and let it go . ''
