Muse vocalist Matt Bellamy wrote this song about his baby son , Bingham , after his fianc√©e , actress Kate Hudson , gave birth to the child on July 9 , 2012 .
The ode to fatherhood kicks off with a sample of Bingham 's heartbeat , which Bellamy recorded on an iPhone just before he was born .
Bellamy explained to The Sun : `` A couple of days before Kate gave birth we went for a check-up and I recorded it on my iPhone as I thought it was an amazing sound .
I found it three months later and plugged it in to the recording system , recorded a tempo and the orchestral piece around it .
Then I wrote the lyrics about wanting to lead and protect , all the feelings that having a kid evokes . ''
London-based dubstep duo Nero contributed to the production of this track .
