Phoenix frontman Thomas Mars commented on this song to the Washington DC free newspaper Express : `` I think it 's the same idea that you 're a little lost .
I like the idea that when the singing is a little out of control you ca n't control really what you 're doing or you ca n't control time or something .
So it 's the same the way I see it and sometimes the lyrics feel like it , or sometimes I just repeat a word because I like it so much .
I think its just influences .
Not to compare us , but I know Miles Davis would do this ; he would just play one note that he loved for 10 minutes .
As musicians , we really put ourselves into it . ''
