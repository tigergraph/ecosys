The first official single from Drake 's third album was leaked on his October 's Very Own blog on February 1 , 2013 .
He said at the time : `` I feel sometimes that people do n't have enough information about my beginnings and therefore they make up a life story for me that is n't consistent with actual events .
My family and my second family -LRB- consisting of the best friends anybody could ever have -RRB- all struggled and worked extremely hard to make all this happen .
I did not buy my way into this spot and it was the furthest thing from easy to achieve .
I am proud of every part of my past and I 'm excited for this song to find a place in your life as well .
`` Drake added , `` I did n't feel I needed any interviews or radio or press to launch this song .
It felt right to come back to the site that I started on and release it to the people that started here with me . ''
Producer Mike Zombie created the sinister-sounding soundscape , over which Drake raps in a more menacing tone than usual presumably to highlight his early struggles .
The video is a celebration of Drake and his team 's journey from the bottom to life on top .
`` We just wanted everyone to feel the fun of it all , '' said Little X. `` For me it was always a celebration .
Just what he said , ` started from the bottom ' and now we 're here - so I was in the world of we 're here .
Especially after we get past that moment in Shoppers -LSB- Drug Mart -RSB- , we start hitting you with that life that they 're living right now . ''
This won Best Video at the 2013 BET Awards .
Drake also won the viewers ' choice award after being nominated for 12 prizes .
The ceremony celebrates black actors , athletes and musicians as part of the US cable TV network , Black Entertainment Television .
Drake references his motto of `` no new friends '' in the bridge .
The phrase also was used as the title of a DJ Khaled single , which Drizzy prominently featured : `` No new ni -- as , ni -- a we do n't feel that F -- k a fake friend , where you real friends at ? ''
`` I 'll be out trying to get a sandwich or something and the guy will say to me , ` I 'd give you a free drink with that , but you know , no new friends , ' '' Drake told Billboard magazine with a laugh .
`` I swear I 'm not sitting around going , ` What 's the new meme going to be ? '
But I do spend a lot of time when I 'm writing , especially lately , trying to make something for people to live by .
I 'm trying to make anthems that are empowering to people , to find phrases that I have n't heard before .
I 'm not just going to sit here and be like , ` Fu -- in ' bitches , getting money ! ' ''
Drake was inspired to write `` Started From The Bottom '' after hearing Jay Z and Kanye West 's Watch The Throne track `` Niggas in Paris '' for the the first time .
He recalled to Rolling Stone : `` I was like , ` How did I not think of that ? '
-- ` Ball so hard , that s -- t cray ! '
It was real rap s -- t , but it felt melodic ; all the cadences felt so good . ''
The Toronto MC added that it challenged him to come up with a rapped hook just as catchy as a sung one and he came up with this song .
Drake reveals on the song a frustration that because he did n't come out of the ghetto like some other rappers , he is portrayed as never having struggled .
`` Boys tell stories ` bout the man , '' he spits .
`` Say I never struggled , was n't hungry , yeah I doubt it n -- a. '' Directed by Little X , the song 's music video finds Drake starting at the bottom in a pharmacy before being promoted to night manager .
By the end of the clip he is flying the skies in a private jet .
It was the clip for Psy 's `` Gangnam Style '' that inspired the epic nature of the visual .
`` It 's been a long time since people had seen a big video , '' Little X explained to MTV News .
`` His conversation with me , even when we did ` HYFR , ' was that music videos did n't have the impact that they used to have .
Drake came up watching the videos that I made , and all of us made back in those days -LSB- when -RSB- Busta Rhymes was being chased by elephants , Diddy was jumping out of helicopters , driving Hummers in the desert and dancing with Jennifer Lopez .
`` Videos were massive events back then and that did n't exist anymore , '' he continued . ''
` Gangnam Style ' kinda brought a bit of that back , so I guess that hyped him up ... doing something large and exciting and something that people would wan na see and talk about . ''
Drake told the July 2013 edition of GQ magazine regarding this cut : `` I think a lot of people wish their favorite rapper wrote it , as if a song like that should be gangster , but I was the one who wrote it , and everyone has their bottom . ''
Drake performed the song for the first time on television live during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25 , 2013 .
Nothing was the Same 's artwork was created by the Southern California artist Kadir Nelson , who also designed Michael Jackson 's posthumous album , Michael .
The two-part piece features a profile of Drizzy as a child with an afro comb in his hair , looking directly at an adult version of the Toronto rapper/singer adorned with a gold chain .
Drake explained to MTV News that the artwork represents that his `` most clean , concise thoughts from now , and my best recollection of -LSB- the past -RSB- . ''
`` I wanted to give people something that they 'd be like , ` I 'll never forget this right here , '' he added .
`` It 's vibrant and there 's something about it that captures you , and I think that 's kinda how this album sounds . ''
