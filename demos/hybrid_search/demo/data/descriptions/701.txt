This is the lead single from the British downtempo styled duo , Zero 7 's fourth album , Yeah Ghost .
This song , along with three others on the album , features the vocals and lyrics of Eska Mtungwazi .
The London-based singer whose collaboration credits include Matthew Herbert and The Elektriks , bought a new energy and attitude to the duo .
However their collaboration nearly did n't happen as she was working on her album and wanted neither the distraction nor the `` session singer '' tag .
Zero 7er Henry Binns recalled in publicity materials that , when she wrote the lyrics for this song , `` she had the whole thing done in 24 hours !
When it comes that quickly there 's obviously something right and she could n't get away from that .
She changed it all in a matter of two days .
We thought we had a bunch of nothing , and she came in and just did all of those tracks . ''
