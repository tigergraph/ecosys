This elegant love song is a tale of unrequited love that comes together in the end .
The message of the song is that life is full of unexpected events that often lead to what 's ultimately for the best .
For Vanessa Williams , the song had special meaning as she recovered from a scandal where she was stripped of her Miss America crown when nude pictures of her surfaced .
Williams became a very successful singer and actress , overshadowing the scandal with her talents .
This topped the Hot 100 for five weeks and was named by the ASCAP as its Song of the Year for 1992 , meaning it was performed more than any other song in that year .
This was written by the songwriting team of Jon Lind , Wendy Waldman and Phil Galdston .
According to an interview with the writers in Songwriter Universe magazine , Lind and Galdston wrote the song with bitter and ironic lyrics , which Waldman changed to make it an uplifting song .
The song was not intended for Williams , and the artists they shopped it to turned it down , but when Vanessa Williams heard the demo , she told her record company that it was the song she 'd been waiting for her whole life - the song was her whole story .
Other countries where this topped the charts include Australia , Canada and the Netherlands .
