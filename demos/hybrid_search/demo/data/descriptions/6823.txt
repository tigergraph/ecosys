This song is about how a person did n't want to know the truth and refused to accept it .
The line , `` Just Ignore the smoke and smile '' implies ignorance of an event to a person has happened .
`` Call it aftermath , she 's turning blue what a lovely color for you '' in the last line adds a lighthearted tone to the song .
Call it aftermath , something has happened , and as a result she 's turning pale .
