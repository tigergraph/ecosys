Hootie & the Blowfish frontman Darious Rucker penned this song with Country music songwriter Rivers Rutherford and Learn to Live producer Frank Rogers .
Rucker discussed this song on his record label 's website : `` For me , this song was n't so much about turning 40 ; it was the whole lifetime of being in Hootie and getting married and the life we lived .
This song is a ` thank you ' to my wife ; I want to live my life being happy .
All the dumb crap we did in our younger days , I just want to be happy with you .
In the chorus - ' I want laugh like I 'm not afraid to cry ' - I love that line .
That song is just special to me .
I remember shaking Rivers Rutherford 's and Frank Rogers ' hands when we finishing and saying , ` thank you . ' ''
