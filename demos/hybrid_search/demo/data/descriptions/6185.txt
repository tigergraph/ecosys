Pixie let The Guardian August 27 , 2009 have a peek at her diary .
`` You have to have experiences when you 're a songwriter .
That 's why I love singing my song Nothing Compares -- I get really emotional .
I cried when I recorded it because I was thinking about a friend who had died at a young age .
That helped me deliver the lyrics . ''
