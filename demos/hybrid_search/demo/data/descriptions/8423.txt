Lyrically much of Robbie Robertson 's fifth solo album is focused on remembrances , and on this song the former Band guitarist addresses finding his musical footing in the mid - '60s .
He described this song to Mojo magazine as , `` about me with The Band , we were playing down South and ended up in New York - I was living at the Chelsea hotel with Edie Sedgwick .
It 's a flashback . ''
The song starts with Robertson recalling his early days backing the Canadian rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins who led a band called The Hawks .
After Robertson left Hawkins with Levon Helm , Richard Manuel , Rick Danko , and Garth Hudson , the quintet styled themselves Levon and the Hawks , but they ultimately called themselves The Band .
Robertson recalled to Mojo May 2011 : `` I was 15-years-old when I met Ronnie Hawkins .
I had a little band in Toronto and we played as the opening act at an arena somewhere , because I was n't old enough to get in the clubs that he was playing .
He was like another species , and so was his music .
It was so fast and swift and he was a beautiful creature on-stage , growling and pushing the music .
And all over the place .
He was an extraordinary performer .
He was leaping through the air and landing just in time to come in with the next verse and at the same time The Hawks were just fantastic .
Levon was just extraordinary . ''
