This song features a hook up with Natasha Bedingfield .
The English pop singer-songwriter discussed her contribution to this song in an interview with Billboard magazine : `` With Nicki , I come from London and we 've got a heavy influence in hip-hop .
She called me and was like , ` I 'd love for you to sing on this .
I 'm a huge fan , ' and I was instantly like , ` I 'll do this . '
I heard the song she 'd written and it gave me goosebumps .
I was like , ` I 've got to be on that . '
I was in Detroit , doing some promotion , so I went into Eminem 's studio and it was amazing , really catching off Eminem 's vibe .
He was n't there , but his studio is great . ''
The NewYork Post reported that Minaj only recruited Bedingfield one week before the release of the album .
A source told the newspaper : `` Nicki Minaj phoned Natasha Bedingfield a week before her album Pink Friday was about to drop , to say they should duet on Minaj 's Last Chance .
`` The source added that Bedingfield was `` so excited '' to hear from Minaj , but initially expressed concern that she would n't be able to record the song in time as she was on tour .
The English singer then managed to find a gap in her diary in order to record her part after she decided that she loved the tune .
