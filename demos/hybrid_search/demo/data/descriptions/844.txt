This song is about a young girl whose best friend is dying of cancer .
She is annoyed and frustrated at the fake enthusiasm of well-meaning friends and the barrage of cheery music from what she feels are empty artists like Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani that seemed to follow her everywhere .
Wayne Coyne wrote this in the car with Steven while they were driving from Oklahoma to New York .
-LRB- thanks , Jake - Stillwater , OK , for all above -RRB- This was inspired by a friend of the band whose father was dying of cancer .
