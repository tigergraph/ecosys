Guitarist/keyboardist Anand Wilder told Complex magazine regarding this song : `` We were trying to be as minimal as possible .
Just a few elements .
I do n't know if we achieved it , but that was the goal with that one .
It was inspired by Prince .
I wish Prince could sing it . ''
This song is actually two separate recordings glued together .
Wilder told Complex magazine : `` You can notice at the end .
The tempo changes at the end .
We took two different completely distinct recordings , and pasted them together . ''
