This is believed to be Mick Jagger 's response to Keith Richard 's solo track `` You Do n't Move Me , '' which was a dig on Mick .
Jagger claims this is about a girl and has nothing to do with Richards .
Keith Richards : `` I think we cut that in Montserrat , an island that no longer exists .
That smoldering heap of volcanic eruptions .
And we were the last guys to cut there .
That was the last record anybody cut there .
It 's what happens when you work with The Stones .
They got a hurricane and then it erupted .
It was a pretty island once .
With `` Mixed Emotions '' I think I had the music and I went to Mick and said , bring your bit to it .
Because it 's a two-way street a lot of the time .
I mean there was a time when Mick and I used to write face-to-face all the time .
But we were on the road then .
Now we can bring ideas to each other and sometimes it 's strange - we had n't seen each other for maybe 5 or 6 months and we get together and funny enough , we 'd each have written a piece of music that actually fits together even though we have n't been in communication with each other . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- The Stones went on tour for the first time in 8 years to support the album .
The Steel Wheels tour ushered in a new era of concerts for big , established bands .
On that tour , The Stones arranged for corporate sponsorship , TV deals , and various other marketing opportunities .
They also bypassed local promoters , using a tour manager to serve their purpose .
This allowed the band to make a great deal of money on the tour .
There was speculation that this tour would be the last for The Stones , but they have done several others since .
Richards referred to this as `` Mick 's Emotions , '' believing it was about his feud with Jagger .
The B-side of the single is `` Fancyman Blues , '' a track recorded during sessions for a hurricane relief effort .
