The song is about the life and sacrifice of a rodeo cowboy .
The song begins with a phone call from a cowboy on the rodeo who is always on the road .
He phones home to his love to check in and also to apologize for letting the rodeo and the life he is leading take precedent over their relationship .
During the conversation , the cowboy assures her that he is coming home .
However , her tone alerts him that something is wrong .
The chorus reveals that the woman has gotten fed up with the life he has left her with and has decided to leave him and go with another man .
He then explains that as much as it pains him , he will go on to his true passion , the rodeo .
The woman is shocked by his reaction , but even though he momentarily has second thoughts about his decision , he still feels that his love of the rodeo will mend his heart .
Cheyenne is the most prestigious rodeo around .
Without telling her , he was going to skip Cheyenne to come back to her .
He was going to give up Cheyenne to be with her , one of the biggest sacrifices a cowboy could make .
