This Motown classic was originally recorded by Barrett Strong in 1959 .
Strong became a writer for Motown , and worked on some of The Temptations ' hits .
The song was written by Motown chief Berry Gordy with help from an assistant at the company , Janie Bradford .
Beatles producer George Martin played the piano .
John Lennon sang lead .
Along with `` You 've Really Got A Hold On Me '' and `` Please Mr. Postman , '' this was one of three Motown songs the The Beatles released on their second album , titled With The Beatles in the UK and The Beatles ' Second Album in the US .
Berry Gordy , who ran Motown Records , was thrilled that The Beatles thought highly enough of Motown to record their songs .
The Beatles performed this at their audition for Decca Records in 1962 .
They did n't get the deal , but were singned on their next audition , which was for Parlophone Records .
Decca did sign Brian Poole And The Tremeloes .
Speaking of money , Paul McCartney is the wealthiest rock star ever , earning over a billion dollars in his career .
