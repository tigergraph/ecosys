This is one of three previously unreleased tracks that were originally recorded during the Swoon sessions that were later included on the `` Seasick '' single .
`` Seasick '' was released in a 10 '' vinyl record format on November 25 , 2011 for Record Store Day 's `` Back to Black Friday '' event .
Frontman Brian Aubert explained to Billboard magazine that this song underwent a complete transformation from its original version .
He said : `` When we first started writing it , it went in so many directions .
It got quiet , then loud .
It had like seven parts .
It made sense at the time .
Even the producer was excited .
As we wrote more songs , every time we 'd come back to it , it was just terrible .
It 's all over the place .
It felt a little pedestrian .
In hour 11 before we went in , I took it home and tore it apart .
It 's much smaller and much tighter .
We kept the one part we liked and wrote something around it . ''
