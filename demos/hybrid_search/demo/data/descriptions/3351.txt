His anthem to the Type-A 's of the world , Vertical Horizon lead singer Matt Scannell wrote this song about control freaks .
And it 's one of his proudest accomplishments .
Says Matt , '' ` Are you tired of holding up the sky ?
Teaching birds to fly ?
You 've done it all your life .
Are you sad when you see the sun ?
'Cause then you 're not the brightest one when all is said and done , and all is said and done . '
It 's kind of a funny lyric in a way .
But I know people who think that they 're holding up the sky .
They think that if they stop trying to hold up the sky the whole world 's going to fall down .
They think that they have to teach every bird how to fly .
It 's like , ` Dude , we know .
The birds know .
The sky 's there .
It 's okay , it 's gon na be okay . '
It 's like they 're always in a triathlon .
And I 'm not that kind of person .
I fall on the other side of it , like ` Save Me From Myself ' where I kind of retreat back , and can be a little bit reclusive .
But some people in my life , I can just see them wasting their energy on things that they ca n't do anything about .
Or wasting their energy on things that they 're not doing anything about .
I 've never been able to , I think , write a lyric that meant so much by saying so little .
I was really proud of being able to paint that picture so completely in such few words . ''
