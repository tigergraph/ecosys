TFK frontman/songwriter Trevor McNevan told NewReleaseTuesday that , `` the inspiration for this song was to take a hard rock song into the club . ''
He explained : `` The intro and the initial lyrics and melody , ` Heyo , here comes the danger up in this club ... etc , ' was written a few years ago for a possible album intro to Welcome To The Masquerade , and never ended up being used .
I still loved it and the idea of adding a hint of ` club ' to a hard rock song , so I wrote a song around it and kept the same title .
I love strings when they 're used tastefully , and I think they add that extra layer of dynamics here - it 's a very theatric song .
I 've never heard anything quite like it . ''
