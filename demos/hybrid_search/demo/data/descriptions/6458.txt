Geddy Lee -LRB- Guitar World , March 1990 -RRB- : `` On a tune like ` Available Light , ' where the bass just provides some simple , low-end support , I 'd rather play the keyboards and sing .
It 's just a question of what instrument will be rewarding to play from a player 's point of view .
If the keyboard is simply playing a strict , four-chord repeating pattern , then I 'd rather just program it into some MIDI pedal and have some fun playing bass . ''
