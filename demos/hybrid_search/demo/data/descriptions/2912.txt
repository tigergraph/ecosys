Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is a Rock Opera about a man and a woman who are separated by death .
The man is in Hell and the woman is in Heaven .
`` Hang 'Em High '' is the western version of the story .
This guy is a `` Shotgun Sinner '' who has a great shot .
He falls in love with a lady who one day dies of a misfire .
He kills himself , and they are separated .
When he says , `` Got you in my sights '' he is talking about this lady and how his only goal is to get through these thousand demons to be with her again .
