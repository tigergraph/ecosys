The Cars seventh album , Move Like This was released on May 10 , 2011 and was the American rock band 's first record of new material since 1987 's Door to Door .
The record featured all of the original band members except for bassist and vocalist Benjamin Orr , who died of pancreatic cancer in 2000 .
This is the first single from the album , which was released to radio on March 1 , 2011 .
Frontman Ric Ocasek explained the inspiration for the song in an interview with Spinner UK : `` That song 's a little bit topical , I guess .
The lyrics in the song , it 's all about ` heartache 's waiting to strike ' and ` too many screamers wearing a mask , ' which is all kind of a sad scenario .
But it 's got happy music and a happy melody .
It 's almost like ` Just What I Needed , ' where you 're looking for someone to bleep and you do n't realize the song is not really that positive .
Sometimes it 's just subconsciously things pull you in .
It can be a sad song that pulls you in subconsciously .
The lyrics to ` Sad Song ' are a sad state of affairs and you just get pulled along with them all .
Maybe it 's media , maybe it 's the general ambiance of life . ''
