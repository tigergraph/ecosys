This is one of three tracks on Insatiable that Coyle wrote with Guy Chambers .
She told Digital Spy about composing with the former Robbie Williams collaborator : `` We worked in LA and London and literally recorded a song a day : ` Insatiable ' , ` Natural ' , ` Raw ' , ` Love To Lie ' , song , song , song !
On our last day he took me and my boyfriend out to dinner with his wife to celebrate .
We had champagne !
It was very dignified . ''
