This is a traditional minor-key Spanish carol from around the 15th or 16th century .
USA Today , noting that Archuleta sings it in Spanish and that he is over half Hispanic himself , asked him if he speaks Spanish fluently .
He replied : `` Just a little bit .
Both of my parents are fluent , so it 's pretty embarrassing that I 'm not .
But it 's still a big part of my family .
All my mom 's side speaks Spanish .
I speak to my grandparents in Spanish .
Slowly .
And they 're patient with me !
But I do speak with them in Spanish and carry on conversations with them . ''
Archuleta explained to USA Today why he chose to record this carol .
He replied : `` Well , ` Riu Riu Chiu ' is in Spanish .
I 'm not going to do , like , ` Mi Burrito Sabanero , ' you know , or any of those kinds of songs , but I wanted to do something in Spanish .
I wanted to do songs that people were n't really familiar with and were n't used to hearing .
` Riu Riu Chiu ' was in Spanish , so it was a way to give to the Latin side of me and the Latin audience .
It was mainly to have a Spanish flair added to the album and to have something unique to add to the album , like ` Pat-A-Pan ' was .
We listened to a bunch of different versions and arrangements , just to see what people did to make them interesting .
There were some that were really interesting , or really simple , like little kids singing them , or a guy on a guitar .
It was like , ` Okay , let 's see how I can make it my own version . ' ''
