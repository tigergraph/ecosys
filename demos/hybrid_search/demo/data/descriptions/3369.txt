When he appeared on The Chris Isaak Hour in 2009 , Stevens said of this song : `` Musically , I was revisiting a very Greek-sounding riff - the kind of thing you 'd hear on a Greek island .
The words were attached to that time , my peace anthem .
It ended every show that I did and was quite a show stopper .
It was a very important song for me because it stated one of the big goals of my life which was heading straight for that peace . ''
This became a hippie anthem , and was often used by protesters to spread a message of peace .
In 2003 , Stevens , now known as Yusuf Islam , re-recorded this for a compilation album called Hope , which was a benefit for children in Iraq .
It was his first English language recording since 1978 .
The US and Britain had invaded Iraq , which was perceived by many to be an attack on Muslims .
Stevens explained : `` As a member of humanity and as a Muslim , this is my contribution to the call for a peaceful solution to the dangerous path some world leaders today seem to be taking . ''
This was Stevens ' first US Top-10 hit .
It was not released as a single outside of America because Stevens ' European label , Island , wanted to encourage people to buy the albums rather than the 45s .
In 1987 , 10,000 Maniacs covered this , but it was dropped from future copies of their In My Tribe album in 1989 after Stevens , who had changed his name to Yusuf Islam , condoned the death wish on Salmon Rushdie for defaming the Prophet in his book The Satanic Verses .
