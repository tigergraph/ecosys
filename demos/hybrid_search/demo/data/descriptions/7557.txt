Roger Taylor wrote the melody and chords for the Highlander film , then Freddie Mercury wrote a new bass line , added some instrumental spacers , changed the order and produced a new mix with David Richards .
The song was still credited only to Taylor .
Roger 's version is at the end of the film , Freddie 's version is on the album .
Not only was this song used in the Highlander film , but 2/3rds of the songs from A Kind Of Magic appear as well , making this the unofficial soundtrack of the film .
-LRB- thanks , Sebas - Tokyo , Japan -RRB- The album A Kind of Magic is Queen 's twelfth studio album but the first to include a title track .
The album was also the first by Queen to be digitally recorded .
For the un-fans , Highlander kicked off a fantasy series with the basic premise : There are these Immortals , see , but they can be killed only by being beheaded , and the executioner to do so becomes the new Immortal - and hence the next target for the next challenger .
Some have called it `` Interview with the Vampire for men . ''
That 's really all there is to this , along with some Scottish mythology .
The franchise has since been mired in squabbling versions , sequels , spin-offs , and interpretations all conflicting with each other , rather like the Batman franchise .
At the Highlander film 's climax , when MacLeod -LRB- Christopher Lambert -RRB- leaves Rachel -LRB- Shelia Gish -RRB- , his parting words are , `` Hey , it 's a kind of magic . ''
The phrase `` A kind of magic '' was the starting point for Roger Taylor to write this song .
Other references to the film in the lyrics include `` One prize , one goal '' and `` No mortal man . ''
This was a big song on Queen 's 1986 Magic Tour , which was their last with the original members .
The reason that this was Queen 's last album-promotion tour with the original members was because Freddie Mercury would be diagnosed with AIDS the following year and was too sick to tour after that .
This was also the tour where Mercury wore his white slacks and yellow jacket combo , which has since become his signature get-up .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- Not many fans even note this , but all four original members wrote songs for the band , obeying their own self-stated `` no passengers '' policy .
Freddie Mercury did most of their ballads and experimental , innovative pieces -LRB- `` Love Of My Life , '' `` Bohemian Rhapsody , '' `` Killer Queen '' -RRB- , Brian May did the guitar-hooked hard-rock numbers , -LRB- `` Tie Your Mother Down , '' `` We Will Rock You '' -RRB- , Roger Taylor wrote classic-style rock -LRB- `` I 'm In Love With My Car , '' `` a href = `` http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1384 '' > Radio Ga Ga '' -RRB- , and John Deacon was more into the soul and funk style -LRB- `` Another One Bites The Dust '' -RRB- .
Additionally , all four styles blended when the band members collaborated .
