The Vaccines are a four piece indie rock band from London whose short , punky singles have been compared to The Ramones .
They comprise vocalist Justin Hayward-Young , guitarist Freddie Cowan , bassist Anri Hjorvar and drummer Pete Robinson .
Freddie Cowan is younger brother to the Horrors ' synth man Tom Cowan .
This frantic reverb-drenched debut single clocks in at one minute 24 seconds .
During an interview with One For The People , Justin was asked if the song 's brief appearance was a calculated kick to music industry in order to announce the bands arrival ?
He replied ; `` No not at all .
We did n't realise that it was so short until we recorded it .
All of our songs are as direct as we were able to make them .
That means that a couple of our songs are under two minutes but we do have a couple over five minutes .
Even though it is short , it feels complete .
There 's no need to lengthen it just for the sake of it . ''
Justin Young explained the song 's meaning to the NME : `` It 's about being attracted to trouble , about being out of your depth and thinking you can deal with something when in reality you probably ca n't .
I 'm fascinated by the concept of power struggles in relationships .
I 'm not really sure who is on top in this one .
It 's supposed to be positive , though . ''
