This is a duet with American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi , who also penned the track .
Meat Loaf said of Laurie 's contribution at a listening party : `` He was really nervous at first .
It was strange seeing someone so confident on TV walk into the studio like he 's a quivering mess .
But he nailed it . ''
The song features piano playing by House star Hugh Laurie .
Meat Loaf encountered Laurie , a classically trained musician , whilst making an appearance in the medical drama .
`` I did House and found out he could play piano , '' Meat Loaf explained to The London Times , `` so I gave him a demo and a note and the next morning I walked on the set , he comes running up to me with his arms open , ` Yeah , I 'd love to ! ' ''
