On Say Anything 's 2007 album In Defense Of the Genre , frontman Max Bemis was heartbroken and disillusioned after the ending of a relationship .
He 's now happily married to Sherri DuPree of the Texan rock band , Eisley , and this is one of several songs on the band 's self-titled 2009 album devoted to his new love .
Bemis told Alternative Press : `` This song is about my wife , Sherri .
I wrote this after we got engaged .
I wanted to write a love song for her and realized that as I was writing this album , I needed this song to fill the narrative gap between `` Mara And Me '' to explain this stage where I had dealt with my issues and finally felt self-empowered and was able to meet someone who was not a throwaway person .
I 'm a screwed up , weird guy , so this song talks about someone who is worth putting in that much effort for because they 're right for you .
I 'm really proud of this song because to me , it 's the first pure love song that can be cherished by the person I wrote it for as well as other people .
It distils my feelings so accurately about when Sherri and I first started talking that it means a lot to her too .
It meant as much to me that she loved it and it I wanted her to love it as much as any other person that heard it .
I think that 's what makes it so special and innocent .
If no one ever heard it and it was a song that I just wrote for Sherri , I would be happy because it would let her know things that I can only express in a song . ''
