Out of the Game was produced by Amy Winehouse collaborator Mark Ronson .
Wainwright told MusicRadar.com this song is `` a prime example of Mark stepping in and making it his own . ''
He explained : `` Originally , ` Rashida ' was more of a slow , mournful , somewhat tongue in cheek ballad that I intended on recording with just me at the piano -- it would be something of a break from the band .
Mark heard this ferocious claptrap and just flew with it .
-LSB- laughs -RSB- That song I owe 100 % to him and his ideas . ''
