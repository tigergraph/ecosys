The instrumentation for this song was originally recorded by producers Sly Dunbar & Robbie Shakespeare during the sessions for Grace Jones ' 1980 album Warm Leatherette in the Bahamas .
However it was n't used as it was the only R&B sounding tune and Island Records supremo Chris Blackwell did n't like it much .
Instead it came out as an instrumental B-side -LRB- as `` Peanut Butter '' -RRB- to Junior Tucker 's 1981 single , `` The Kick -LRB- Rock On -RRB- . ''
Sly Dunbar recalled to Mojo magazine December 2008 what happened next : `` Grace heard Steven -LRB- Stanley -RRB- playing the rhythm track one day in the studio , and she said , ' a my riddim that ! '
And she started crying , ' I want back me riddim !
Make we call Chris and tell him say me want me riddim . '
So they gave her back the track and she and this girl Dana Mano came up with the lyrics . ''
Jamaican reggae singer Patra covered this in 1995 , reaching # 60 in the US Hot 100 and # 50 on the UK singles chart .
A re-mixed dance version by Danish producer Funkstar De Luxe peaked at # 60 in the UK in 2000 .
The song 's sexually suggestive lyrics provoked some controversy at the time , which limited its radio airplay .
Hence the original release in 1981 only reached # 53 in the UK singles chart , but after being re-issued in late 1985 it climbed to # 12 .
