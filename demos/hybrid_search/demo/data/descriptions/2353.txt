This is a lullaby written by lead singer Scott Weiland for his 18-month-old son , Noah .
You can see Weiland and Noah in this David Spade sketch about music file-sharing .
Noah gets the line , `` Will you please buy my daddy 's album so I can have food to eat ? ''
directed at another grade-schooler who is struggling to learn why sharing music is a Bad , Bad Thing .
The lyrics , `` So will you tell me the little things ?
What does God look like ?
And angels ' wings ? ''
comes from the Judeo-Christian belief that all unborn souls are lined up in Heaven waiting to be born , and hence babies are new arrivals from Heaven.Weiland 's son Noah , named in the song , is also named after the character from the scriptures of Judeo-Christian religions .
The `` Noah 's ark '' story is told in the Bible , the Talmud , and the Quran , as well as having roots further back in Mesopotamian and Greek mythology .
This song also appears on disk 5 of their boxed album set Original Album Series , being a collection of five STP albums from '92 to ' 01 .
Weiland wrote this with bass player Robert DeLeo .
They composed it while sitting on the edge of Weiland 's bathtub .
The album title Shangri-La Dee Da is a pun on the mythical city of `` Shangri-La , '' from James Hilton 's 1933 novel Lost Horizon .
Its name has become synonymous with the Hindu ideal of an Earthly paradise .
However , lest readers draw a false inference from the band 's name , Stone Temple Pilots get their name not from Hindu temples but from the old stickers for STP Motor Oil , and a game of trying to come up with an original phrase based on the acronym `` STP . ''
