A frustrated Caleb complains on this track that despite his success he feels emotionally bankrupt : `` I got no money but I want you so/I got so much I can not handle , '' he sings.Unlike the Tennessee-based quartet 's previous efforts which centered around Nashville as a base , Come Around Sundown was recorded in New York at Avatar Studios .
The regimented regime there added to the stress of the situation and may have influenced this song 's lyrical content .
Caleb explained , `` It was kind of a depressing experience .
If we 'd made it is Nashville , we 'd be out playing basketball or goofing off .
Here , I 'd wake up and hail a cab to the studio , then spend 12 hours a day in a room with no windows . ''
He added , `` It felt like we were going to the office . ''
This is the biggest rocker on Come Around Sundown .
Guitarist Matthew Followill discussed its sound in an interview with The Music Fix : `` When you start with a song called , ` No Money , ' you know what direction you 're going to go with .
You know it 's going to be punk rock .
You know you want it to sound dirty and raw .
And really big at the same time -- I mean there 's only one thing to do : put some buzz on that bitch .
When I put it on the solo ... `` He continued : '' Nathan had played a drum part for a long time that was just so bad-ass and I could n't step away from it .
During sound checks I 'd always go , ` dude , play that drumbeat . '
And it was really hard for him to play it .
And he 'd play it for so long and I try so hard to write a guitar part for it .
And then finally one day , after playing it for months on tour , I finally came up with a guitar part .
I remember playing that and he was like , ` that 's awesome ' and everyone started playing with it .
And I was thinking , ` thank God , ' because I love Nathan 's drumbeat so much !
And it 's the only rocker on the record . ''
