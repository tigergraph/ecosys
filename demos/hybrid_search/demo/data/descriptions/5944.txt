This holiday song is the first ever solo single recorded by Stone Sour and Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor .
The song was released on December 14 , 2010 .
The lyrics poke fun at those who loathe the holiday season .
Said Taylor about the song 's meaning : `` I wrote this song in my kitchen one winter , listening to people bitch about the holidays .
Personally , I love the holidays , but they seem to bring on severe stress in most people .
So , I wrote this in honor of crotchety , drunken bastards who do n't know the difference between a yuletide and a tool shed .
Plus , I think it 's funny . ''
Proceeds from the song 's sales are being donated to Teenage Cancer Trust .
Taylor recorded the song in November 2010 at Metropolis Studios in London , during a break in the Stone Sour UK tour .
He tracked the tune in a single afternoon .
Taylor drops a sneaky ` Hi Simon !! ' in the song 's fade-out , as a nod to Mr. Cowell and his hijacking of the Christmas # 1 slot in the UK .
