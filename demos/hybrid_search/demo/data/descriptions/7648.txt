This punky , ska-tinged song takes a look at starting an unplanned family .
It is a track on English pop band Scouting For Girls ' second album , Everybody Wants To Be On TV .
Frontman Roy Stride told CMU about the record : `` Musically , we went into the writing process with the aim of creating an album of ten singles .
We wanted to write a classic .
In the download world you have to deliver an album where every track is genuinely great , otherwise people will just download the single releases .
We started with 50 tracks and ruthlessly culled this back to ten great tunes , which flowed together on an album , but also stood up individually .
It took a lot of work to keep up such a high standard .
In fact , it drove us mad and I do n't think I 've worked harder in my life . ''
