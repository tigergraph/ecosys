Released as the B-side to `` Rikki Do n't Lose That Number , '' this fairly obscure song has become a crowd favorite .
In an interview with Rolling Stone during Steely Dan 's 2009 tour , Donald Fagen talked about this song : `` When we moved out to L.A. , people called each other ` dude , ' which we found funny .
We were trying to speak their language . ''
Regarding the lyrics , `` Have you ever seen a Squonk 's tears , '' a Squonk is a mythical woodland creature who has the ability to dissolve in its own tears .
Steely Dan came across the word in a book by Jorge Luis Borges .
Genesis also makes mention of this animal in their song `` Squonk , '' from their 1976 album A Trick of the Tail .
