This is the lead single on R&B singer songwriter Toni Braxton 's sixth studio album Pulse , her debut recording with the Atlantic record label .
It was her first release after a four year hiatus .
The song 's music video was directed by filmmaker Bille Woodruff , known for such classic Braxton clips as `` Un-Break My Heart '' and `` He Was n't Man Enough . ''
The song features Braxton 's Atlantic labelmate Trey Songz , who lends his distinctive vocal stylings to the track .
Braxton told Digital Spy the story behind the song : `` Well , I heard the song and it was written from a guy 's perspective , so I said , ` Nice song - let me rework it ' .
I changed it up and made it a girl 's song .
I 'm going through a separation , and it 's not my story per se , but I definitely can relate to it in the sense of starting over .
I wanted to have strength when I sang it - I did n't want to be a wimp ! ''
