Court Yard Hounds were founded as a side project of the Dixie Chicks by sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire .
On August 6 , 2008 Robison divorced her husband , the songwriter Charlie Robison , after nine years of marriage and found herself pouring her feelings into songs such as this break-up cut .
`` Dysfunction and sadness lead to introspection , '' Robison told The New York Times .
`` All of a sudden I 'm divorced , and I have to redefine who I am .
And through some of these songs I had to dig deep to find my pre-married self . ''
