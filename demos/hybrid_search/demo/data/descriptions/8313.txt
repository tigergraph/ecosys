Back in 2002 , Courtney Love asked the songwriter Linda Perry for `` Beautiful , '' the song that eventually went to Christina Aguilera .
Instead she got this confessional power ballad , which eight years later turned up on Hole 's fourth studio album , Nobody 's Daughter .
Q magazine February 2010 asked Love about Thomas Bartlett , who plays the piano on this track .
She replied : `` Well , we wanted Elton John , and we got this guy that Bono and me were talking about , he played at New York 's Carnegie Hall , he 's very deft . ''
Love contributed one line to the song : `` I never wanted to be some kind of comic relief . ''
She told Spinner UK : `` I have almost nothing to do with ` Letter to God ' other than the fact that no one else can sing it . ''
