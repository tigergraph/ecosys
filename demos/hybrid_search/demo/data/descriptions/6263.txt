Co-singer/guitarist Ed Droste recalled to Drowned in Sound : `` The earliest written song on the album and one of the favourites .
Dan just came in one day , and presented it to us . ''
The single 's b-side is the same track with the lead vocals done this time by Michael McDonald , of the Doobie Brothers .
This was the first ever track to receive a 10/10 review from the Pitchfork music website .
They stated that the track `` proves what Grizzly Bear are capable of when they try and meet the pop-inclined listener halfway . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Sean Pecknold , the brother of Fleet Foxes ' Robin Pecknold .
