This song was written by Neil Young and appears as the final track on Harvest , his fourth solo album .
It features his signature lyrics-from-the-heart , soulful melodies , and poetic countryside metaphors .
Look for the unusual time signature of 11/8 on the interludes , alternating with the standard 4/4 for lyrics and chorus .
Personnel for `` Words '' : Neil Young on lead guitar and vocals , Ben Keith on pedal steel guitar , Jack Nitzsche on piano , Tim Drummond on bass , Kenny Buttery on drums , and Stephen Stills and Graham Nash on backing vocals .
Nitzsche , Keith , Drummond , and Buttrey are also collectively known as `` The Stray Gators , '' primarily the supporting band for Neil Young but also appearing in places like Jewel 's Pieces of You .
The somewhat impenetrable lyrics of this song might be one of the examples comedian Dana Carvey has in mind when he does his parody `` Every Neil Young Song You 've Ever Heard , '' as part of his stand-up routine .
Strumming an acoustic guitar , Carvey does an impression of Young 's voice while singing lyrics like `` secret whores with ancient vices ; Lucky has the lowest prices . ''
The parody , like all of Carvey 's routines , is assumed to be done in the most affectionate spirit imaginable .
While `` Words '' itself did n't see single release , the album Harvest charted # 1 on the Billboard 200 and also on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart .
By the way , the hit `` Heart Of Gold '' from this album is Young 's only # 1 hit .
Part of the Harvest album was mixed at Neil Young 's personal ranch home .
He had his engineer rig speakers right and left to the house and the barn , respectively .
Then Young , Crosby , and Nash would sit outside between the house and barn and listen to the playback .
When asked how it was going , Neil Young might respond `` More barn ! ''
