Following a flight to Toronto in 1969 , Hendrix was arrested on drug charges , for which he was later acquitted .
Hendrix makes reference to this in the lyrics , `` Flying ca n't be trusted - got busted . ''
This was released as a single on April 13 , 1970 , but according to the book Jimi Hendrix : Electric Gypsy , the single was pulled after Hendrix complained about the mix - he thought you could n't hear Billy Cox ' bass part .
Hendrix died on September 18 , 1970 , and this track was released posthumously on Cry Of Love .
