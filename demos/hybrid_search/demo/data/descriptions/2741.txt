This is a duet between Morrison and the Canadian singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado .
Morrison told the Daily Mail August 29 , 2008 that the Canadian singer was originally sent the wrong version of the song , `` but she soon got the hang of it .
She was cool , very funny . ''
The song topped the charts in several countries including Germany , where it was Morrison 's first # 1 and Furtado 's second .
Morrison told The Sun September 25 , 2008 about this track : `` I actually disregarded this song a while back .
I rewrote it three times .
It turned out more acoustic , but it was more rocky before .
At one point it sounded really wet and I was n't feeling it .
Then the idea of a duet came and I thought of Nelly Furtado .
I was aiming high .
Then I was told Nelly was interested and so off I went to Canada and met her in the studio .
She was cool . ''
