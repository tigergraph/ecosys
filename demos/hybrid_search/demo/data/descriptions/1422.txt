Post hardcore glam metal band Black Veil Brides formed in 2006 in Cincinnati , Ohio .
The group comprises vocalist Andy Six , bassist Ashley Purdy , lead guitarist Jake Pitts , guitarist and violinist Jinxx and drummer Christian Coma .
The quintet is known for their distinct appearance , which was mainly inspired by Kiss 's infamous painted face look as well as other 1980s glam acts.Black Veil Brides signed in September 2009 with the independent Standby Records and released their debut album We Stitch These Wounds on July 13 , 2010 .
It sold nearly 20,000 copies in its first week and reached # 36 on the Billboard Top 200 chart .
This is the lead single from their sophomore album and major label debut , after signing with Lava/Universal Republic .
The song was released on May 3 , 2011 on iTunes .
Six told Billboard magazine the song was inspired by a biblical story introduced by the band 's cover artist Richard Villa .
`` He 's very much into biblical stories , '' he explained , `` and he found the whole story of the fallen angels who were the ultimate outcasts .
They were n't sent to hell , but they were n't allowed in heaven .
They had nowhere to go .
They were n't human , either , so they had this lonely existence .
They wound up banding together and creating their own gang of sorts .
We really liked that and wound up writing a song very much based on how we could equate that to our lives .
`` The Old Testament tells us how Lucifer was once an archangel , before he turned proud , rebelled against God and became the devil .
-LRB- Isaiah 14:12 -14 -RRB- .
According to Jewish tradition , about one third of the angels fell with Lucifer , and became demons .
They were cast out of heaven and plunged to earth with the devil .
-LRB- Revelation .
12:3 -4 -RRB- .
