This song came about as a result of vocalist Joe Goddard , taking salvia divinorum , a powerful but legal psychoactive herb , at the Glastonbury Music Festival .
Goddard then described the experience to lyricist Alexis Taylor .
This was originally released in 2007 as a 12 '' vinyl single .
This samples Todd Rundgren 's drawling : `` Before we go any further , I 'd like to show you all a game I made up .
This game is called Sounds of the Studio , and it can be played with any record , including this one - you may be surprised . ''
Guitarist Al Doyle explained to Chart Attack that both he and Alexis Taylor are fans of Rundgren 's album Something/Anything .
He recalled : `` We did n't know we were both fans until later .
When we were soundchecking , I would go to the mic and do that sample and annoy the crap out of everybody in the room . ''
