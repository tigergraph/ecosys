Katie Melua explained to Metro France the background to this song : `` Actually , I wrote that song with Molly McQueen and we wrote it for her , because I 'm trying to write for other artists .
But unfortunately , her album did n't work out so we ended up putting it on my album .
But yeah , we actually wrote it for her acne ` cos she always scratches herself .
She 's addicted to it !
So to me , ` Perfect Circle ' is kind of about an addiction , and that addiction could be about biting your nails , drugs or being obsessed with a TV program .
When you try to straighten out and change your habits , you still always seem to go back to it . ''
