Darwin Deez leader Darwin Smith explained to NME that this song `` extols the virtues of slackerdom . ''
He explained that in the year he took to compose Songs For Imaginative People he `` also did some spectacular slacking off .
`` Smith added that he wrote the song both for himself and his neighbor Breigh who with her husband did the layout for Songs For Imaginative People .
He explained that `` she was only working part-time at the time and feeling creatively stifled .
Now she 's full-time and fully stressed . ''
