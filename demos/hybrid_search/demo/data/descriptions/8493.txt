In our interview with Marcy Playground lead singer/songwriter John Wozniak , he said that this song is based on a true story about a cheerleader who killed herself .
Said Wozniak : `` That 's a song that was written mainly , and conceptualized by Chris Temple .
He was in a band called Lincoln .
But yeah , the story is true .
It was in like Ohio or somewhere .
It was something he had read about ; he started working on the song , and I helped him .
It 's not common that I co-write with people .
I have to really appreciate what it is they 're doing .
They have to be good storytellers .
And I found that Chris Temple is one of the best storyteller musician friends I 've ever had .
I fell in love with that song .
But it was incomplete .
It was n't finished , and so we finished it . ''
