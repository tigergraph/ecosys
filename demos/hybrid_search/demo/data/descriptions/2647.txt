The first single from Joe Nichols ' eighth studio album finds him daydreaming about traveling in the sunshine .
`` What excites me most about this song is that it 's made for radio in the summertime , '' Nichols told The Boot .
`` It 's driving energy to me ... you can picture the video right off the bat .
When I listened to the song , within 45 seconds I 've already got a visual image in my head of driving around in a convertible with your arm around a girl and the wind blowing through your hair .
Sometimes you just feel it , it 's obvious . ''
The song was written by Michael Dulaney , Jason Sellers and Paul Jenkins .
`` The energy is the first thing that struck me about ` Sunny and 75 , ' '' Nichols told Radio.com .
`` The song slowly builds into this screaming , almost like a Journey ` Do n't Stop Believin '' kind of tempo .
So that to me is important , because the music itself brings out emotions , not just the lyrics or how you deliver them .
The music builds , and it takes you on a journey .
You feel like you 're slowly and steadily moving out to the beach , and all the sudden you 're sprinting . ''
Joe described the song to The Boot as sounding , `` as if Journey were to cut a country song and I were to cover that country song . ''
