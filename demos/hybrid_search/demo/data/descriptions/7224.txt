This tender , simple tune is a track from The Alphabet of Hurricanes , the fifth album of English singer-songwriter Tom McRae .
The record was recorded over three years in varied settings including McRae 's own studio , Gunpoint , in East London .
McRae explained the titular name-dropping of the Hollywood legend on his record label 's website : `` I 'm a big western fan ... I bought a box set of John Wayne movies and watched him age in the space of a few days during one hot summer in New York .
It was a reminder that we do n't have much time to celebrate or mourn each passing day , so in a city of personal ghosts it 's best to make peace with your past and move on . ''
