This song is about a guy who buys a `` Chevy '' which turns out to be a Corvette .
In the car he finds a note written by a soldier named Private Andrew Malone .
It says that if you are reading this it means he never made it home and that you will always be riding with Private Malone .
The guy always feels Private Malone with him while he is driving , then one night he gets into a bad wreck and someone says they saw a soldier pull him from the crash - he knows that it was Private Malone .
