Carlile told The NME that she had an `` out of body experience '' working with John .
She said : `` It was amazing .
I 've never seen a person of any age so excited about music and so inspired .
He did piano and vocals in under an hour and a half .
It was unbelievable .
And he told me about a whole bunch of bands I had no idea about and got after me for not knowing them and started sending me records .
The whole time it was like an out-of-body experience .
Every once in a while this total panic would come over me when I realised who I was talking to . ''
After he recorded this song , Elton John wrote out a note for Brandi 's niece .
Carlile says she 's saving that note and will give it to her niece `` when she 'd old enough to understand how special it is . ''
One of Carlile 's musical idols , Elton John , plays the piano and sings on this track .
She told Billboard Magazine how she hooked up with the British legend : `` He 's my greatest influence since I was really young , about 11 years old .
Tumbleweed Connection is maybe my favorite record of all time , that or Captain Fantastic .
We felt like ` Caroline ' had the same funky piano vibe that he had all the way through Tumbleweed Connection .
We went through the channels ; I knew the worst he could do was say no .
He did n't say no .
He said yes .
He responded directly to me , called me on the phone one morning .
I was just like , ` Man , this guy , he is just no bulls -- t .
He is so cool . ' ''
Carlile also used Elton John associate Paul Buckmaster for string arrangements on the album .
