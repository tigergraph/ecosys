Frontman Tim Armstrong said of this song on the band 's MySpace site : `` Blown out and abandoned hotel buildings that were once new in the times of great American prosperity .
Cold fronts of society 's collapse blow in , where poverty and despair now live . ''
Guitarist Lars Frederiksen said : `` It 's got the Chuck Berry riff on the chorus accompanied with the Greg Ginn attitude . ''
