This song is about when you know something extremely bad is about to happen and it probably will , but there is a chance you can avoid it by `` running for your life . ''
As indicated by the lyrics , `` No time for goodbye ... This is my last time , '' it may be about two people who were together and loved each other very much but it ended prematurely .
