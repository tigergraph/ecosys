This song is about the argument that Cypress Hill had with another Gansta Rap singer : Ice Cube .
Originating when Cube allegedly stole Cypress Hill 's song `` Throw Your Set in the Air '' According to an interview given by B-Real , Cypress Hill 's lead voice , Ice Cube was allowed to hear the recordings of the track `` Throw Your Set in the Air '' when it was in the mixing process .
Cypress Hill were producing the song for the movie Friday , in which Ice Cube was acting .
After listening to the track , Ice Cube asked B-Real if he could use that song for a song of his own .
B-Real refused , for this was a song created for the movie .
Ice Cube asked to listen to the track once again , which he was allowed to , and then went home .
After some time , Ice Cube released a song called `` Friday , '' that in some part was musically very similar to Cypress Hill 's song .
In `` Friday , '' the chorus was , `` Throw your neighborhood in the air . ''
In rap slang , `` set '' is a synonym for `` neighborhood . ''
That 's when the problems began and Cypress Hill decided to write `` No Rest for the Wicked , '' and included it on the same album with `` Throw Your Set in the Air . ''
At the end of the first part of the song we can hear : `` Cube , better sit back and check yourself . ''
That 's a reference to one of Ice Cube 's songs , `` Check Yo Self , '' included on his 1993 album The Predator .
Curiously , this album was produced - among others - by DJ Muggs .
from Cypress Hill .
The song is full of references and insults to Ice Cube .
For example , it makes fun of Ice Cube 's real name , O'Shea Jackson .
In one verse it claims : `` Jackson , lem me figure out the name - Jack 'cause you be stealing other n-gg-z game . ''
In this context , `` Jack '' means `` To Steal . ''
In one part of the song the story about this argument is told to the listener , yet very briefly and very Cypress Hill-styled .
We can hear DJ Muggs stating : `` Yeah n-gga , my homie thought he had a homie in you .
He let you listen to our mutha -- ckin ' cut , and you turned around and put some old variety s -- t out .
What kind of s -- t is that ?
Hmmm ... '' -LRB- thanks , Kike - Lima , Peru , for all above -RRB-
