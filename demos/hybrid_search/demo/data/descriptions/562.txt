This song found Cook hooking up with Aerosmith and Def Leppard producer Marti Frederiksen , Scott Stevens and a German orchestra .
He explained to Billboard magazine : '' ` Take Me As I Am ' is probably the most power-ballady of the songs on the record .
We got an orchestra from Germany to do the strings , and they really did an incredible job .
The song itself I wrote with Marti Frederiksen , who 's written a ton of stuff and Scott Stevens , the singer from The Exies ... I do n't think I 'd ever put a song 's structure together that quickly . ''
