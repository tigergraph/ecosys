Guitarist Nick Jonas , the trio 's main songwriter , told the Australian radio show The Hot Hits : `` The inspiration for this song came by way of sitting one day at a piano and writing my first song through the use of only the black keys .
It was then that I realized the simplicity of black and white versus the noise that is brought on by color . ''
