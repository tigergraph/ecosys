The woman who sings the haunting , unsettling ending and bridge is a British woman by the name of Marianne Faithfull .
She started out as a member of London 's '60s swing scene , moving up slowly through a life of love , loss , and drug abuse .
-LRB- thanks , Lacy - Yukon , OK -RRB- Some of Faithfull 's lyrics -LRB- `` Say yes ... at least say hello ... '' -RRB- were taken from the Marilyn Monroe movie The Misfits .
Metallica performed this on Saturday Night Live with Faithfull .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France , for above 4 -RRB- The song is about a celebrity who is fading into obscurity and it is driving her mad .
The theme is similar to that of the movie Sunset Boulevard .
When Metallica plays this live , the crowd sings Faithfull 's parts .
