Jack 's Mannequin lead singer Andrew McMahon wrote this song as a message to his wife when he found out he had Leukemia .
He is telling her he does n't want to leave her .
McMahon also wrote a song called `` Katie '' which is dedicated to his sister who gave him bone marrow .
Both songs were played live at a Jack 's Mannequin concert on July 11 , 2006 in Cleveland , Ohio , with Katie in attendance for the performance .
