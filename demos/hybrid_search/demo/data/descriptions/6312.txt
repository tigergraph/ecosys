The Used close their fifth album , Vulnerable on a romantic , yet dark note .
The song was heavily inspired by the Chuck Palahniuk novel Damned , about a thirteen year old girl who finds herself in Hell , unsure of the details surrounding her death .
Another major inspiration was the 2011 Lars von Trier film Melancholia .
`` Maybe the end of everything , so long as you can be with the person you love , everything will be alright , no matter what , '' said vocalist and lyricist Bert McCracken .
`` It 's kind of a sappy , end of the world song . ''
