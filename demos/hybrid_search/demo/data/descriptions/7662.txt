In Spring 2007 , Carpenter fell badly ill with blood clots in her lungs .
She was forced to cancel her summer tour to recover , and the singer fell into a depression as she felt she 'd let everyone down .
This song reflects that dark period in her life .
She explained to Express Night Out : '' ` Iceland ' is obviously not about the country Iceland .
It 's a metaphor for darkness , cold , alienation , loss , disconnection .
It 's my attempt to write about what happened to me getting sick three years ago and the sense of dislocation and depression and fear - terrible fear - that happened . ''
