Lead vocalist Caleb Followill said on his band 's website that this ballad is : `` about a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up . ''
One of this song 's lyrics is , `` Jesus does n't love me , and no one ever carried my load . ''
This has provoked much comment as three of the Kings of Leon are sons of a Pentecostal preacher , and the fourth , his nephew .
Frontman and lyricist Caleb Followill admitted to the NME that `` when it was played back to me and I heard the line ... my eyes welled up with tears .
It was the worst thing that I could imagine . ''
So why did Caleb write the couplet ?
He told The Daily Telegraph September 17 , 2008 that he was referring to the guilt of person with a Christian upbringing living the rock 'n' roll lifestyle .
The son of a preacher explained : `` There 's still lingering guilt , and once I start to drink you do n't want to be around me because there 's a level of brutal honesty , if not just pure meanness .
In a way , I lash out at everyone else because that 's when I start to point fingers at myself .
And that 's when I write lyrics . ''
