In an interview with the Sun April 18 , 2008 , frontman Liam Fray named this as his favorite track on the album .
He said : `` It 's about falling in love with someone and the general bulls -- t that goes with it .
Why plan ahead and say you will love them for ever ?
It 's better to take stock and not talk about marriage and kids and enjoy today .
I 'm a realist .
It 's the best way to be . ''
St Jude , who was known as Judas or Thaddaeus was one of Jesus ' 12 disciples .
He was a different Judas to Judas Iscariot , the disciple who betrayed Jesus .
Tradition has it that St Jude preached the Gospel in Syria , Mesopotamia and Libya and suffered martyrdom along with Simon the Zealot in Persia .
Fray explained to the Manchester Evening News that the inspiration for their album title came from their behind the scenes guiding force , manager Conrad Murray .
`` I 've got a little St. Jude pendant that I wear on a chain close to my heart at all times , which our manager gave me the day our Academy 3 gig in July -LRB- 2007 -RRB- .
I think it 's the only time we 've been a bit weirded out by our success , as we had n't even put out a single then .
`` St. Jude is the patron saint of hopeless causes .
Fray added : `` I 'd like to think that someone has got to be looking over the lost causes , hopefully people will get it , we chose it as it speaks for itself - someone 's looking out for you . ''
Liam Fray painted the album cover 's artwork , which features the actress Audrey Hepburn .
