`` That was a really fun song to write , '' says Click Five keyboardist/songwriter Ben Romans , `` because we wrote it with keyboards instead of guitars for the most part . ''
And since Ben is also the keyboardist for the band , that makes perfect sense .
He also feels that no band should take itself so seriously that it never wavers from the formula .
`` One good thing to do sometimes is to push yourself to experiment , just put yourself in different places , '' he says .
`` I think sometimes it helps you simplify stuff .
In this case , we were just messing around with keyboards just to kind of not be pretentious about something .
It 's like almost , for a song like that , it 's good to kind of get out of your own comfort zone . ''
The term `` headlight disco '' describes an impromptu dance `` club '' where kids will gather `` in the forest with their headphones and dance . ''
The song came about , according to Ben , `` from talking about writing a song just like you would do a video treatment .
So it 's just kind of the story line , a very simple song , when someone is trying to get someone to come out and celebrate .
It 's just more of a cinematic kind of song . ''
