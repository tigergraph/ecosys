The Eagles wrote this after a tour in Europe .
They started the composition around September 11 , 2001 .
The message is that love is the ultimate savior in a world damaged and corrupted by evil and hatred .
It also conveys parents ' dreams and hopes for their children in such a troubled society .
-LRB- thanks , Jake - New Rochelle , NY -RRB- Don Henley explained in the liner notes for The Very Best Of The Eagles compilation that he penned on the darkest day in American history : September 11 , 2001 .
`` I sat down at the piano in my home studio and started putting some chords with the phrase ` hole in the world , ' '' he said .
`` Months went by , but I did n't show it to anybody .
Then , other things started happening that gave additional meanings to ` Hole in the World , ' particularly after the -LSB- Iraqi -RSB- war started .
The fighting was supposedly over in May , and yet one or two or three of our boys were - and still are - getting killed every day , which means somebody 's daddy is not coming home .
So that 's another ` hole ' -- a huge hole in somebody 's life - a child , a wife , a mother , a father , a brother , a sister . ''
