When Jeremy Stover , Jamie Paulin and Thomas Rhett Akins penned this song they included the sound of an ukulele , giving it a Hawaiian feel .
Said Scotty : `` When I hear this song , I have a bunch of pictures going through my mind , like jumping in the lake , stuff I grew up doing .
The Hawaiian feel and fun nature is the reason I cut it .
It 's about a girl and a guy and they are at the lake .
They are about to leave and he says , ` Write my number on your hand so I can call you up . '
At the end , it takes a twist .
She says , ' If you want to see me , write my number on your hand . '
It has all of the country things in it , like farmer 's tans and Coca-Cola . ''
