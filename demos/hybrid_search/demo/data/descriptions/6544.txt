This uptempo track with doleful lyrics balances out some of the slower songs on Young Love , which is Kearney 's fourth album .
The Oregonian singer told us : '' ` Ships In The Night , ' with that beat ... you put it on and it is undeniable .
Bam .
Five seconds in you 're bobbing your head and you 're hooked in with the texture in the song .
And then you start listening to the story and you 're like , Aw , this is kind of sad .
You say things like , How many of our parents have made it anyway ?
Like , we 're just fumbling through the gray , that kind of thing .
Like , whoa , did you just say that ? ''

The phrase `` like ships that pass in the night '' is generally used for people who meet once or twice by chance for a short time but then do not see each other again .
Kearney explained the meaning of this relationship-difficulty song to AbsolutePunk : `` I wrote that about those people that are closest to you but you still feel so far away from sometimes .
It 's my cry to want to connect with someone that 's close to you but emotionally very far away .
I 'm writing out of my own experience with that . ''
