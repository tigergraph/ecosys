This songs refers to the backlash the band received from the Punk Rock community once they hit superstardom , most specifically the California Punk community and the club `` 924 Gilman St '' where Green Day got their start and built a following .
Members of that scene in 1994-1995 vowed to assault Green Day on site should they ever attempt to return .
Being ' 86 'd ' is to be ejected or kicked out of a particular establishment .
