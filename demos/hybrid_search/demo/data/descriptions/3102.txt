The lyrics seem to indicate sex ; perhaps a one-night-stand with somebody : `` Eye on what I 'm after , I do n't need another friend . ''
The subject is after something that has planned using clever motives and tricks , he 's not looking for a friend : `` I 'll take just what I came for , then I 'm out the door again . ''
Another interpretation for this song is that it may concern the use of drugs : `` Peripheral on the package , Do n't care to settle in . ''
The subject is set on doing what it is he/she has to do and leave .
