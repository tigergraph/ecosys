This features vocals from veteran Welsh singer Shirley Bassey .
She says she was asked to participate after Propellerhead Alex Gifford wrote the song with her in mind .
She explained in the Miami New Times , November 19 , 1998 : `` He said he was asleep , and he thought about me , and these words came out .
And I asked , what 's a 35-year-old man doing thinking about a grandmother ?
I could n't imagine ! ''
The Propellerheads sent a demo to Bassey , who loved it but thought it might be more appropriate for Tina Turner , but the Propellerheads persuaded her to record it , arguing they wrote it specifically for her.The Propellerheads said : We approached her last summer when our profile was rising and we felt confident enough to try a few mad ideas .
The song was written specifically for her and she recognized we were n't taking the mickey .
We could n't expect her to come to our hovel in Bath so we booked a London studio , got the champagne and roses in and wore our best shirts . ''
The song was used as the theme for the UK Channel Four show So Graham Norton , comedian Graham Norton 's chat show , which ran from 1998 to 2002 .
