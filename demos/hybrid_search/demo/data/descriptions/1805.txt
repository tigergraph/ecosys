This song covers Herbie Hancock 's `` Cantaloupe Island . ''
Like Hancock 's original , `` Cantaloop '' was released on the influential jazz label Blue Note Records .
This single was Us3 's very first one that was certified Gold in the USA , and the album Hand on the Torch was Blue Note 's first Platinum album .
The spoken opening lines `` Ladies and gentlemen , as you know , we have something special down here at Birdland this evening : a recording for Blue Note Records '' are a reference the famous Birdland Jazz Club in New York City .
This line is actually Pee Wee Marquette 's opening announcement from Art Blakey 's first Birdland album A Night at Birdland Vol .
1 in 1954 .
