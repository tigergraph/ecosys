Mike Mogis , who produced the indie supergroup Monsters of Folk 's debut album , as well as playing on it , recalled to Express Night Out the recording of this track : `` That song came about in sort of a flurry of about four hours of overdubbing a bunch of stuff .
It was the last day of our first session -LSB- in Omaha , Neb. -RSB- .
I was in the A room doing rough mixes of some of the songs and they went into the B room by themselves to rough in some ideas ... then I added parts as well .
That 's how it started ... That one was an experiment .
` Let 's throw together one more song . '
It was an improvisational experiment in recording .
They literally just tried anything .
It could have easily imploded because there was so much in there after four hours .
It ended up cool .
It 's a fun track to listen to .
There are bits of things that come in and out and that was due to the more improvisational recording style of the song . ''
