The tracks on The Dissent of Man written by vocalist Greg Graffin are some of the most personal ones he 's ever written .
Bassist Jay Bentley told Billboard Magazine : `` I think Greg wrote some really wonderful , personal lyrics here ; a song like ` Avalon ' really caught me off guard .
It 's in the comfort zone of Bad Religion , but it 's beautiful , which is an adjective you would n't necessarily use to describe a quote-unquote punk rock band . ''
