When Lana Del Rey was 15 she got involved in drugs and alcohol , so her parents sent her away to an exclusive boarding school in Connecticut .
The singer recalls the events on this moody ballad where she reminisces about `` table dancin ' at the local dive '' and `` Drinkin ' cherry schnapps in the velvet night . ''
She goes onto remember her 15-year-old self ready to depart to her boarding school , `` waving on the train platform , crying 'cause I know I 'm never comin ' back . ''
