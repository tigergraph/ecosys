Gallows frontman Frank Carter -LRB- From Kerrang !
magazine April 18 , 2009 -RRB- : `` I was thinking about all the forgotten children who die before their parents , and this song is about one of those poor bastards becoming Death 's apprentice .
Death to me is a much more imaginative concept than God - I thought it would be interesting to think about someone training to be his apprentice and learning to reap souls .
Act I has me singing .
I felt a little vulnerable , as I have n't sung much before .
It sounds okay and I do n't cringe too much when I hear it . ''
Grey Britain features some surprising acoustic moments including on this song .
Turner explained to The Sun May 1 , 2009 : `` I knew I could sing well enough to get away with it and we just wanted to show people a different way of looking at not only our band but all music .
We literally took the same set of lyrics and made two songs at opposite ends of the same spectrum .
We wanted to challenge ourselves and every band that will ever use this record as reference in the future . ''
