Frontman Alex Kapranos -LRB- from self-titled magazine -RRB- : `` I do n't have a classical music background , so when I read about music theory sometimes it spurs me on to write in a different way .
I was reading about modes , and I realized you can write in these modes just by choosing what note you start on and restricting yourself to certain notes .
So I was going through this experiment of trying to write on just the white keys on the keyboard , and that 's how the melody came about.In the clubs of ' 94 , I 'd fallen asleep on my hand .
They 'd write something on my hand or put a stamp on my hand , and it was on my face the next morning .
And I thought , ` Would n't it be wonderful if someone had written their name on your hand , and it was backwards on your face but then forwards on your mirror . '
Something like that would be an omen -- and I do love omens . ''
