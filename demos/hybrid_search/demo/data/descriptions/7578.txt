Martha Wainwright wrote Come Home To Mama after two significant events in her life ; the birth of her son Arcangelo in November 2009 , and the death of her mother , Folk singer Kate McGarrigle , from cancer two and a half months later .
This song finds Wainwright reporting to her late mom that , `` the baby 's doing fine '' and asking her for guidance as she clears the clothes out of McGarrigle 's closet .
`` That was the first song I wrote after she died , '' she told Spinner .
`` It took me a few months to pick up the guitar and start writing songs , and obviously , I was n't going to sit down and write a song about my dog .
I just needed to find a way to approach this thing without being maudlin , or depressive .
This was how I was talking to her after she died ; I was looking for guidance , trying to find some connection , and just trying to hear anything back . ''
