The song is the opening track of Clockwork Angels , an album that is built around a narrative of a young man 's journey towards his dreams .
Bassist-singer Geddy Lee told MusicRadar.com : '' ` Caravan ' starts the story off ; it 's basically about a young guy who 's got big dreams , big desires , and a very romantic vision of what the world 's supposed to bring him and he ca n't wait to go out and see it .
So he kinda runs away from home , stows away on the back of an airship .
In our world airships are trains that fly !
And yeah he sets off to find the world . ''
Alex Lifeson 's guitar solo was described in an interview by the website Musicradar.com as `` unruly . ''
The guitarist concurred with the description adding : `` I definitely wanted something that was out of control .
It 's all over the map , kind of frenetic and climbing up and down with what the rest of the track was doing . ''
The song reached # 19 on the Finnish singles chart and # 44 in the band 's home country of Canada .
