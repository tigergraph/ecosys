This song is about a girl that co-vocalist Justin Wiley had a crush on .
The band 's other singer Jessica Leplon explained to Artist Direct : `` She 's one-of-a-kind , so he decided to write a song about her .
It 's funny because she had no idea until she saw we wrote the song about her .
It 's too late -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
It 's cool though .
We 've never written a song about a person and put the person 's name in it .
That was new for us , but it 's probably one of my favorites on the record . ''
