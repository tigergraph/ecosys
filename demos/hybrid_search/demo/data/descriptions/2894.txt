Former Supergrass frontman Gaz Coombes opens his debut solo album , Here Come The Bombs , with this song , which was inspired by television reports about the 2011 Libyan Civil War .
He told The Guardian : `` I got this feeling that there are a lot of people around the world who are n't listened to and they 're being wronged .
It had an effect on me -- a very strange emotion -- enough to make me start writing stuff down . ''
Here Come The Bombs was co-produced by Sam Williams , who previously worked with Coombes when helming Supergrass 's 1995 debut album , I Should Coco .
Coombes told BBC Breakfast about the album title .
He said : `` It 's the opening line of the first track , it had a feel about it .
I liked the statement and boldness of it .
It 's a metaphor for the songs , -LSB- which are -RSB- 11 little sonic explosions . ''
The song started out as a poem , written by Coombes from the point of view of a bomb traveling at the speed of sound .
`` You see aerial footage of bombs dropping and it does n't seem real .
But down there , it 's fu -- ing mental , '' he told The Guardian .
Coombes plays every instrument on Here Come The Bombs .
He said that it was n't so he could say : '' ` Hey look at me , I can play this stuff ! ' ''
, but rather an expression of spontaneity .
