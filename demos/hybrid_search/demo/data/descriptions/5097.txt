Jessie Ware told The Sun regarding this song : `` It 's about a fight I had with my best friend Sarah .
She and I argue a lot but we are also the best of friends .
This was a song that demonstrates that we can go from being amazing together to being so terrible .
I love her dearly but it was easier to write a song about it than enter a fight .
`` The argument took place at the wedding of Ware 's manager .
`` It was drunken and it ended up with a mudcake I 'd made being thrown in my face and a trifle being thrown at her , '' the singer recalled to The Observer .
`` I thought it was quite funny -- we were being idiots -- but it escalated into her being really angry at me . ''
The single-take video consists simply of Ware sitting while singing the song , with the camera slowly rotating around her .
Ware 's collaboration with A$ AP Rocky was a last minute addition to Devotion - The Gold Edition .
`` I love A$ AP Rocky .
I know I wanted a rapper on ` Wildest Moments ' .
I did n't know how I was going to do it , '' she explained to Billboard magazine .
Ware added that back in January 2013 , `` he was promoting his record in the U.K. .
He got interviewed asking who he 'd like to collaborate with , maybe UK artists , and he mentioned me .
I was like , ` Oh my God , he knows who I am . '
So we were like , ` Let 's just send this track and just hope it happens . '
And just before the deadline we get an email with his verse in the post .
It was just so exciting . ''
The song soundtracks a Durex condom commercial .
Ware defended the use of her tune during an interview with Radio.com : `` People started tweeting me , '' she said , `` being like ... ` Ugh , Jessie Ware should know that her song is in a Durex ad .
It 's awkward . '
And I was like , ` No , I okayed that ! '
I 'm so happy it 's promoting sex and safe sex and I think my best friend who the song 's about is a bit iffy about it because she 's like , ` Oh God , people are going to think we 're more than friends . '
But no , I 'm so proud of it to be honest .
I 've always wanted to make sex music .
Now I can say I 'm in a sex advert . ''
This is one of three songs on Devotion that Ware wrote with the Nu-Folk singer-songwriter Kid Harpoon .
`` He was the one who was like , ` Forget the minimal electronic stuff , let 's make some fu -- ing big pop tunes !
, ' '' said Ware to The Guardian .
`` He wanted to bring out the Alicia Keys in me . ''
Ware reworked the song for the US version of Devotion inserting a verse by A$ AP Rocky .
Tweeting about the collaboration , Ware wrote : `` Always wanted a rap on Wildest Moments !
Dreams do come true eh ! ''
This was one of the last songs that Ware wrote for Devotion .
`` It was scarily easy , '' she told The Observer .
`` It came out in a couple of hours and it was like : ` Cool , that 's done . '
Sometimes the musical gods are on your side ; someone is smiling down on you . ''
