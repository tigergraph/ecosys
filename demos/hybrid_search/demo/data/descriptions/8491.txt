Every little girl dreams of getting married , right ?
Vanessa Carlton wondered where that idea came from , and presents a counter-argument to the idea of wedded bliss as an aspiration .
She told us : `` I have yet to hear a song that represented that point of view and that kind of female philosophy .
Which , I believe is very optimistic , it totally is subscribing to a great love .
I absolutely believe that , and I also support people that want to get married .
That 's totally your prerogative and I have met a few couples that have wonderful marriages .
This is the way that I feel .
And it 's not very popular .
-LRB- laughing -RRB- I hear a lot of the male side , from the male point of view , you know , I do n't want to settle down .
Not ready to settle down .
It 's different , it 's not anti-settling . ''
Vanessa Carlton did become a bride when she married Deer Tick singer John McCauley on December 27 , 2013 .
Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks , who is an ordained minister , officiated the wedding ceremony .
Carlton was 30 years old when the Rabbits on the Run album was released , and like many girls , she felt some pressure to get married .
She told us : `` This kind of buzz of anxiety that surrounds a lot of women when you hit a certain age - about marriage - I wish that did n't exist .
And I understand the whole pregnancy situation with women where if you want to have a child , you only have so much time .
But you still can wait to your early 40s , you still could figure something out .
I think it 's a bit unfair , because I think it shuts down a lot of women in their most exploratory phase of their life .
I mean , I just turned 30 and I ca n't even tell you how much more curious I am - I 'm more curious now than I 've ever been . ''
