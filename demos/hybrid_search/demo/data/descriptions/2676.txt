Geddy Lee , Rockline , May 13 , 2002 : `` Nocturne was one of the later songs that we wrote for the record after the break that we had .
There was a group of about 5 or 6 songs that came from a two week period of just what I would consider the best jams Alex and I have ever had .
I really love this song , I love the drum pattern , especially the way it starts .
Its kind of about the questions you can subconsciously answer in your dreams without realizing it . ''
