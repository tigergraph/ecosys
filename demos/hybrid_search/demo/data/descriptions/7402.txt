This haunting , rueful tune was released as the lead single from singer-songwriter Matthew Houck 's Muchacho album , the follow-up to 2010 's Here 's to Taking it Easy and the sixth under his Phosphorescent moniker .
The LP was written in Mexico .
`` It sounds really cheesy , but I went down there with a guitar and got a little hut on the beach in Tulum , on the Yucatan Peninsula , '' said Houck .
This song portrays the post-traumatic stress of a soured relationship and Houck 's attempts to will himself out of his funk .
It was inspired by the singer breaking up with his girlfriend whilst touring Here 's to Taking it Easy .
`` Relationships are tough when you 're on the road , too -- my girlfriend would come on some of the tours , but it was n't easy , '' Houck told Pitchfork .
`` Drugs and booze were involved .
So I lost the place , lost the girl , and lost my mind . ''
