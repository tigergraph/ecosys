This dance-floor filler is the lead single by the American Pop-Rock band Maroon 5 , from their fourth studio album , titled Overexposed .
The song finds Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine in a downbeat mood as he reminisces about a failed relationship .
The song , which was produced by `` Moves Like Jagger '' co-authors Shellback and Benny Blanco , was debuted on The Voice on April 16 , 2012 and released for download immediately afterwards .
The song 's title comes from Levine 's line at the start of the song , which also serves as the hook : `` I 'm at a payphone trying to call home all of my change I spent on you . ''
We 're not sure where he found a payphone and why he did n't call on his cell .
Maroon 5 had intended to pursue a `` no guests '' policy for Overexposed but the opportunity to involve Khalifa was too good to pass up .
Levine told MTV News he was glad the band bent the rules to get the Pittsburgh rapper .
`` He 's already so huge , but he has n't really done many big pop records , actually , so just the idea that he 'd be interested in doing it was enough to get him involved .
It was too good to pass up , '' he said .
`` He 's a wonderful guy , he 's so creative and so quick ... watching him in the studio , he was just so in it , within 30 minutes he had this incredible verse and he 'd already knocked it out . ''
Levine did most of the stunts in the video himself and he told E !
Online all the clothes worn were from Men 's Warehouse .
`` I did n't want any of it to seem stylized , '' he said .
`` I wanted it to feel as much like it was really happening as possible . ''
Maroon 5 gained their first UK chart-topper with this song , having had a couple of near-misses .
The group spent two weeks at the # 2 spot with 2007 's `` Makes Me Wonder '' and four years they were stuck in the runner-up spot for seven weeks without ever reaching # 1 with `` Moves Like Jagger . ''
Regarding the line `` Fairy Tales are full of s -- t , '' Levine explained to The Guardian : `` I 'm talking about fairy tales in general .
The disillusionment one experiences through being let down by love .
I think a lot of people would argue that some people are lucky enough to live the fairy tale .
But then there are times when they wake up and think : ` his is all crap . '
That happens to me sometimes . ''
Blanco told Artist Direct about Wiz Khalifa 's contribution : `` I love it when there 's a weird collaboration that does n't make sense on paper , '' he commented .
`` I said , ` Wiz you 've got to jump on this track . '
Five minutes before he showed up , I realized I did n't have a beat for the bridge .
So I made the beat really quickly .
I want to catch you off guard .
When you 're listening to it , you have no idea he 's going to come in . ''
The song tied the record for spending the most weeks in the top three of the Hot 100 without reaching # 1 .
It spent 15 weeks bouncing between # 2 and # 3 on the chart equalling the top three runs of LeAnn Rimes ' `` How Do I Live , '' Shania Twain 's `` You 're Still The One '' and Timbaland 's `` Apologize , '' which all peaked at # 2 .
Levine made the winning shot for his local YMCA championship basketball team at the age of six , and his love for the sport has continued ever since .
`` And if that shot had bounced off the rim all those years ago ?
Who knows , '' he told MSN , `` Maybe today I 'd be a serial killer or something . ''
Adam Levine is a self-proclaimed car nut .
He drove for a time a 1971 Mercedes 280 SE 3.5 Cabriolet , which he swapped in December 2011 for a vintage Porsche convertible .
The song features rapper Wiz Khalifa , whose verse is more direct than Levine 's despondent lyrics .
`` Had a really good game but you missed your last shot , '' he raps .
`` So you talk about who you see at the top , or what you could 've saw .
But sad to say it 's over for it , phantom roll out valet open doors . ''
`` On our last record , we had a feature with Lady Antebellum , and on this one we did one with Wiz , '' said Levine to Rolling Stone .
`` There are n't many bands that can do that ! ''
The 493,000 units logged by this song in its debut week broke the record for most digital download sales by a group over a 7 day period .
The total was almost 30,000 more than the Black Eyed Peas , who set the previous best in 2009 with `` Boom Boom Pow . ''
Flo Rida holds the ultimate record with `` Right Round 's '' 636,000 in February 2009 .
The song 's music promo sees Levine escape from a bank hostage scenario only to be pursued by the police across the Californian desert .
`` The video is this crazy thing ; it 's about a bank robber , it was actually an idea that I had , and Sam Bayer , who 's a brilliant director is doing it , '' the singer told MTV News .
`` I work at a bank and I wear these glasses that are really a bit creepy and maybe make me look like a child molester .
It 's a real go-for-it , swing-for-the-fences video , I get brave and I steal a gun from one of the guys and try to be a bad-ass , which is weird , because I 'm not a badass . ''
In the United Kingdom , a sound-a-like cover by a collective named Precision Tunes debuted at # 9 on the Singles Chart , a week before Maroon 5 's version was released .
Asked by UK newspaper The Guardian why so many people relate to the song , given that they barely use payphones anymore , Levine replied : `` I think in the age of the cellphone the payphone has transitioned from this thing we used to use on a very regular basis to this thing that is only associated with being used by someone under duress or in an emergency .
If you 're using a payphone that illustrates the point that you 're struggling somehow or you 've lost your cell .
You 're stranded .
It indicates something much more than it used to mean , and that 's kinda cool . ''
Benny Blanco told the story of the song to Artist Direct : `` I was down in Virginia , '' he explained , `` and two of my writers Ammar Malik and Daniel Omelio `` RoboPop '' were kicking it down there as well .
They were working on ideas .
They started this thing on an organ and sent it over to me .
The first thing I heard was , ` I 'm at a payphone . '
I was like , ` Holy f -- k , that 's ridiculous .
We 've got to elaborate on that . '
We tweaked it a little bit .
I sent it to my friend Shellback .
I was on a train to Boston , and he shot an idea right back .
We tweaked it more .
When we write songs , the lyrics will be nonsense with the melody at the beginning .
We sat on it for a month or so , and it all came together . ''
In peaking at # 2 on the Hot 100 , this became the highest-charting hit with the word `` phone '' in its title .
The previous best had been Soulja Boy Tell 'Em 's 2009 hit `` Kiss Me Thru The Phone , '' and Lady Gaga 's 2010 single `` Telephone , '' which both reached # 3 .
Levine has known Jake Gyllenhaal since kindergarten .
In 2007 , he appeared with the actor in a Saturday Night Live Digital Short called Iran So Far .
Adam Levine worked as writer 's assistant for the TV show Judging Amy before Maroon 5 hit it big .
The show 's producer Barbara Hall was a family friend .
