This was featured in the movie Waiting To Exhale , which stared Houston as one of 4 women struggling to deal with the men in their lives .
The song reflects the emotional state of the women in the film .
According to BBC Radio 2 DJ Paul Gambaccini , The song 's writer , Babyface , could n't call this ` The Shoop Shoop Song ' as Betty Everett had already recorded a song with that title , so he put ` Shoop Shoop ' in brackets instead .
In the US , this spent 11 weeks at # 2 after a single week at # 1 .
It marked the longest consecutive stretches that the same 2 records have been 1-2 on the chart -LRB- this and `` One Sweet Day '' by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men , '' and spent the most weeks at # 2 after being # 1 .
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England , for above 2 -RRB-
