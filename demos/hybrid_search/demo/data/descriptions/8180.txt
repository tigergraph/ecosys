This is the first single from Canadian alternative rock band Hot Hot Heat 's fourth studio album , Future Breeds .
The song was inspired by a photo that frontman Steve Bays took when touring .
`` One of the people that was on the road with us was turning 21 and we were in this small college town , '' he recalled to Spinner UK .
`` Every bar we went to that was still open would n't let him in and he was literally turning 21 at midnight .
I just remembered I had a photograph of him on my phone , pleading with the bouncer and he was pointing at the clock and the bouncer 's holding his ID .
I took that photo and wrote turning ' 21@12.' `` Bays added : `` The song 's actually just about the false sense of freedom that you have in your early 20s when you get all the benefits of being an adult , but you have none of the social responsibility and you 're kind of unaware of how your actions reflect you .
It 's just such a great , fleeting sense of false freedom . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Michael Maxxis -LRB- AlexisonFire , Three Days Grace , Cradle of Filth -RRB- .
It was shot in Edmonton with the band and a collection of characters that included a shirtless man with a rhyme .
`` There was a curly haired guy with his shirt off , just a guy in the street who literally came running out of his apartment , '' frontman Steve Bays recalled to Spinner .
`` He 's like , ` I 'm Jay McKay from back in the day/where weed was weed and hay was hay , ' and all of these weird one-liners .
And he has missing teeth .
He was really the most truly Edmonton character you could find .
`` Bays asked the man to appear in the clip , but he was initially reluctant to appear bare-chested .
`` He 's like , ` Let me throw on a shirt , ' and I 'm like , ` You know what ?
You look perfect just as is , ' '' he recounted .
