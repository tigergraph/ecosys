The closing track on Centerfield , this was originally titled `` Zanz Kant Danz '' to refer to Saul Zaentz , Fogerty 's former boss at Fantasy Records , who famously tried to sue Fogerty for plagiarizing himself -LRB- specifically his Creedence Clearwater Revival material , to which Zaentz held the rights -RRB- in the song `` The Old Man Down The Road '' from the same album .
The song is about an unnamed street dancer and his sidekick , a pig trained to pick people 's pockets as they watch the dancer do his stuff .
The pig , originally named Zanz as a dig at Saul Zaentz , `` Ca n't dance , but he 'll steal your money - watch him or he 'll rob you blind . ''
When Zaentz threatened Fogerty with yet another lawsuit , Fogerty changed the pig 's name to Vanz .
Another song from the Centerfield album , `` Mr. Greed , '' is also thought to be a musical salvo by Fogerty in his long-running feud with Zaentz , which lasted until 2004 when Fantasy Records was bought out by Concord Records , who restored Fogerty 's rights to his CCR material .
-LRB- thanks , Joshua - Twin Cities , MN .
for all above -RRB- The video for this was the first ever filmed entirely in `` Claymation . ''
It was produced at Will Vinton Studio , named for the inventor of the clay animation technique .
Unfortunately , unlike other groundbreaking music videos such as a-ha 's `` Take On Me '' and Dire Straits ' `` Money For Nothing , '' this one failed to garner much public notice .
