Several songs on teen singer/songwriter Greyson Chance 's debut album Hold On 'Til the Night focus on dealing with heartbreak , including this single .
Greyson told Billboard magazine it is a subject he 's all too familiar with , even at 13 .
`` When all this first started ... they started putting me in the studio and I was cutting records , and it was a mixture of being excited and being very nervous , '' he said .
`` I did n't really know who I was at this moment , so I took this record to evolve into myself and put myself in my music .
And also , I was going through a heartbreak at the time , and that 's where most of the lyrics come from .
This record really helped me gain courage and strength , and for the fans , I hope they gain courage and strength from it as well . ''
The music video features actress and singer Ariana Grande playing Greyson 's former girlfriend .
Ariana is best known for playing the role of Cat Valentine on Victorious .
Greyson told MTV News why this was chosen as the lead single from his debut album .
He explained , `` I think ` Unfriend You ' is an amazing record because , one , it 's a breakup song , which breakup songs are always fun , and two , it 's referencing social media , especially in this day and age , I think it 's very important to reference social media in music . ''
