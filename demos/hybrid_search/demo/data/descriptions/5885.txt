This was written at guitarist Ryan Ross ' house .
It was the last song that the band wrote before they went into the studio .
Ross recalled to VH1 : `` Jon -LRB- bassist Jon Walker -RRB- and I were playing guitar .
Spence -LRB- drummer Spencer Smith -RRB- just grabbed the lyrics - they were just for whatever , not for anything we were playing .
He just came up with a melody for this thing .
We ended up writing most of the song that night , at least the basic idea .
I think that 's the most experimental song on the album because there 's no chorus .
It 's two different songs put together . ''
