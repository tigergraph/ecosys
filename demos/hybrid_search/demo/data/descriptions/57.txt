This track from Dream Theater 's eleventh album , A Dramatic Turn Of Events , was a collaboration between guitarist John Petrucci and keyboardist Jordan Rudess .
Petrucci told Musicradar.com the story of the tune : `` I demoed this song early on and brought it to the band .
I had an idea for a ballad , but when I sent it to the guys I definitely said that I was open to anything , all thoughts and suggestions.I worked a lot with Jordan on bringing the middle bridge section to another place .
He 's such a master at coming up with the coolest chord and melodic movements .
It cascades in ways that you do n't expect , the way the chords are modulating and moving .
From the demo process , we kept a Moog solo that Jordan did -- I absolutely love it . ''
Petrucci told Music Radar how the song 's title was inspired by a bumper sticker : `` The title came about one day when I was driving in the city with my mom .
My sister was about to have a baby .
So we were stopped at a light behind this pickup truck , and on the truck was a bumper sticker in Spanish that I interpreted as ` This is the life . '
At the same time , I was playing the song for my mom .
Right then , I looked at her and said , ` That 's the title of the song : This Is The Life . ' ''
