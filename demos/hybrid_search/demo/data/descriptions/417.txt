This is the lead single from American recording artist Lenny Kravitz ' ninth album , Black and White America .
It was released on June 3 , 2011 .
The music video was directed by Paul Hunter and finds Kravitz portraying three characters , gameshow host Bart Billingsworth , drummer Bubba Washington and singer Desmond Richie .
Like many of Kravitz 's tunes `` Stand '' has a psychedelic component to it .
He told Gibson.com this hearkens back to his childhood .
Kravitz explained : `` I was a major hippie .
I lived that as a child with my parents in New York City , and then I re-lived it as a young adult .
Psychedelia touches a part of me that stems from childhood .
You can actually hear a Partridge Family influence in a song like ` Stand . '
People laugh at that stuff , but it was good music , with great melodies and great arrangements .
Obviously , I mix it with funk , and other styles , but those things from childhood definitely have stayed with me .
Psychedelia eventually morphed into glam -- in the form of artists like KISS , and Bowie and T. Rex .
I listened to all that music , as a kid .
It all comes together in the form of quirky songs like ` Stand ' or ` Rock Star City Life . ' ''
The song was written for a close friend of Kravitz ' who was paralyzed from the waist down because of an accident .
He explained to the Reading Eagle newspaper in an interview published in September 2011 : `` I was n't in the country at the time with the person , and I wanted to give this person some positive words and something to just continue to listen to help motivate them .
It was like , what could I do ?
And what I could do is just give some positive words . ''
Happily , his friend subsequently recovered .
