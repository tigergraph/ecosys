This song deals with being given a glimpse of God .
It 's something we dearly want , but unless we work for it , we will never see it again and even then may not be worthy of it .
Gaffa is gaffa tape , a thick industrial tape used in the music business for taping down and tidying up large numbers of leads -LRB- wiring , etc. -RRB- particularly useful in concert situations .
The song is trying to simulate being trapped in a kind of a web ; everything is in slow motion -LRB- `` it all goes slo-mo '' -RRB- and the person feels like they 're tied up and ca n't move .
-LRB- thanks , Lee - Ottawa , Canada , for above 2 -RRB-
