Shelby Lynne gives it to you straight , and the first few lyrics from `` Heaven 's Only Days Down the Road '' are chillingly to the point .
`` 100 so miles from the Mobile RiverLord I ca n't have her so I got to kill her .
`` Lynne -LRB- formerly Shelby Lynn Moorer -RRB- was 17 years old in 1986 when her father shot her mother in the driveway of their Mobile , Alabama home and then turned the gun on himself .
She and her sister , future singer Allison Moorer , were orphaned and sent to live with relatives.Twenty-five years later , it was n't hard for Lynne to write `` Heaven 's Only Days Down the Road , '' which is from her late father 's point-of-view .
`` It 's hard for the listener ; It 's not hard for me , '' she told FaceCulture .
`` I 'm over it .
`` Gathering small bits of peace over the years meant trying to slowly understand , and come to terms with , her father 's actions .
The only way for her to do it , she says , was through song .
The lyrics tell the story of a man struggling with guilt and despair : `` Load up the gun full of regretI ai n't even pulled the trigger yetAnd then : Ca n't blame the whiskey or my Mammy 's waysTwo little girls are better off this wayIn a way , Lynne really does feel like she 's better off .
`` I feel like that no matter what demons daddy had and whatever course he took , his path led me to this one , and I 'm grateful for that , '' she said in an interview with Tavis Smiley .
