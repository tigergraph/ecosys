This is a song about mortality and what to do with the time we 're here .
`` This last year , '' Bareilles said , `` I 've been thinking about my life on a grander scale .
It feels good to me to tap into a higher sense of consciousness . ''
Bareilles wrote this song with Fun 's Jack Antonoff .
The pair were introduced through their mutual friend , Sara Quin , one half of twin sister duo Tegan and Sara , who felt the two would hit it off .
The first time they sat down to write together , Antonoff played the singer a few demos that he had been working on , one of them being the instrumental for `` Brave . ''
The two also penned this tune for The Blessed Unrest .
`` He 's the most incredible human , '' Bareilles said of Antonoff to Radio.com .
`` He 's so inspiring , so funny , so dear and sweet and charming and talented . ''
