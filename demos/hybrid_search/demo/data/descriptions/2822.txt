The second single from Welsh Alternative Rock band The Joy Formidable 's sophomore album , Wolf 's Law , is according to the band `` a song about encouragement , a song about starting over . ''
They added to The Line Of Best Fit that it 's `` a passionate plea to someone you love , who 's lost their lust for life . ''
Greg Jardin directed the song 's music video .
The ` spooky house , ' where it was filmed is in Agua Dulce , California .
The intro was shot a few miles away in Vasquez Rock Park , which was also the location for planet Vulcan in the J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie .
The director explained the clip 's concept to Video Static : `` I wanted the video to essentially be just like the song and band itself , '' he said , `` aggressive but also ethereal .
That notion , and the band 's recurring visual theme of the wilderness , inspired the idea of the band performing in some sort of elemental battle between man and nature ; and thus , the idea for the dust storm was conceived .
`` Jardin added : `` Visually , my cinematographer David Myrick and I were both excited about the idea of shooting through foreground elements as much as possible - composing a lot of the shots using a frame within a frame , and having as much atmosphere as possible .
I wanted to stay away from an uber-cutty , snap-zoomy , super-shaky type of deal , and let the band 's performance be the basis for the energy driving the video , where the editing sort of speeds up as the song progresses . ''
