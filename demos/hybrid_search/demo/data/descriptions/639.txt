Edens Edge co-guitarist and harmony vocalist Dean Berner said regarding this Angelo Petraglia , Hillary Lindsey and Tia Sillers penned cut : `` Sad songs are one of our favorite types of songs , because of the emotion that they stir up .
` Feels So Real ' is a song that we 've been singing for several years , but we still feel the heartache every time we perform it .
We love the picture that the lyrics paint and how creative the melody and music are .
Whether it reminds you of a lost loved one or of love lost , their memory can feel more real than you ever imagined . ''
