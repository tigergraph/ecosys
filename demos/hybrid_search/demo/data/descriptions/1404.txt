Like the rest of The Truth Is ... , this tongue-in-cheek song 's tale of women asking for chivalry while they chase losers was inspired by the divorce that frontman Tyler Connolly went through in 2010 .
He told Billboard magazine how the fall out from his break-up seeped into everything he wrote .
`` A lot of it stems from the relationship ending , '' he explained , `` ending not to my liking , me having to deal with the consequences , continuing life in a strange city , all alone .
It 's all true , which is a good thing ; it would be funky if people were like , ` Why does the album sound like this ? '
and I 'd be going , ' I dunno ... ' ''
