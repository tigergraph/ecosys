Jeremih discussed in publicity materials this Stevie Wonder inspired song about new love .
He said : `` Sometimes one of the hardest things to do in a relationship is to start over .
You really have to get to know this new girl and her brand new lips , or brand new scent .
I feel like it 's one of the timeless records off the album that can be played 20 or 30 years from now . ''
