Revolution won Album of the Year at the 2010 ACM Awards .
This song also won Video of the Year and Lambert Top Female Vocalist at the same ceremony .
Lambert wrote this song with Natalie Hemby .
It is about a woman confronting her man for cheating , who calls him a `` white liar '' for deceiving her , then admits in the song 's bridge that she has been telling white lies to him as well .
Lambert said in publicity materials : `` I just had been listening to tons of Buddy and Julie Miller and the Steeldrivers , that rockin ' bluegrass music .
Cheatin ' in a small town basically is what it 's about . ''
