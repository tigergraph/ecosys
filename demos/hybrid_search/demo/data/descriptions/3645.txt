Costello discussed the storyline of this T Bone Burnett collaboration during a conversation with Odile W. Husband documented on Elvis ' website .
Said the singer : `` He is a man who has been left by his lover for a more dangerous man and so , to compete with his rival , imagines himself the worst he can be , a gunrunner , a dissolute painter , a brigand after dark .
Even in his wildest imaginings , he ends up in a defeated army , sitting in a locomotive yard without any boots . ''
This was the last piece recorded by Costello and his backing band in Nashville .
He recalled : `` The band had barely finished writing out their numbers charts when we hit ` Record . '
In truth , I finished harmonizing the final refrains , while the players were already at their music stands.This is the kind of high wire act that does n't always come off but on this occasion , everyone was simply listening to a story and responding .
It is one of my favourite ensemble performances on the record . ''
