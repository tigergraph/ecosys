This is the first single from the Californian Electro-Hop band Far East Movement 's second major label album , Dirty Bass .
The song features rapper Rye Rye , whose real name is Ryeisha Berrain .
The Baltimore native is a hometown friend of producer Blaqstarr , who tipped her to M.I.A. when she was still in high school .
M.I.A became Rye Rye 's mentor and she was signed to the Paper Planes singer 's N.E.E.T. imprint .
However Rye Rye 's pregnancy in 2009 resulted in the delay of her much anticipated debut album , Go !
Pop !
Bang ! .
Jello are desserts made with sweetened and flavored gelatin .
Their name is derived from the Kraft Foods brand name , Jell-O , but outside the US and Canada these gelatin desserts are known as jelly .
As this is a song rather than a food database we 'd better add that the best known Jello in music is probably Jello Biafra , the former lead singer and songwriter for San Francisco punk rock band Dead Kennedys .
Coming in second would be the '90s group Green Jello , who had a hit with `` Three Little Pigs '' and changed their name at the request of Jell-O 's parent company , who did n't want their product associated with the comic-rock group .
