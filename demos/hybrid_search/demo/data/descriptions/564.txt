Frontman Orlando Weeks had been looking for the opportunity to insert one of this song 's lines for years .
He told NME : `` A cab driver said to me , ` You never know it 's too late until it 's too late . '
I tried to get it into songs over and over again , but it never felt right , until this one .
He was a very deep cab driver .
We had a real moment . ''
Weeks told the NME that the band wanted to create a documentary feel on the song 's video , explaining : `` The video reveals areas of the London Underground system that have been unseen for 50 years and beautiful buildings that have become derelict . ''
