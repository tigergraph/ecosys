McRae said regarding this song : `` Anyone who 's had even half a life carries a few regrets and a few ghosts with them .
They come back to you when you least expect it .
I wanted to put that sensation in a percussive song , something driving and repetitive , like someone trying to outrun the advancing tide . ''
