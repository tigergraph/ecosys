This was the second single off pop singer Sean Kingston 's sophomore album , Tomorrow .
This song reflects Kingston 's personal acceptance concerning his appearance .
He confided to The Jamaican Observer : `` The musical journey for me has been crazy .
A lot of people try to fight me out .
The industry people judge you on your outer appearance .
Because I 'm a big kid , dem say I am overweight .
Mi fight me way to the record label to put out the first album .
I am blessed now and I 'm taking care of my family , which is the most important thing . ''
