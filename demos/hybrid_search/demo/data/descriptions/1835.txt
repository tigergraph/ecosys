On this song Eminem raps over Dr Dre 's sinister production about picking up celebrities and subsequently murdering them .
A serial killer theme runs throughout the Relapse album .
The Observer Music Monthly May 2009 asked Eminem if he had Silence of the Lambs on loop in his house .
He replied : `` I did find myself watching a lot of documentaries on serial killers .
I mean , I always had a thing for them .
Oh , that 's not twisted in itself at all , right ?
I 've always been intrigued by them and watching movies like that , and I found that going back through my DVD collection and watching movies about killers sparked something in me .
The way a serial killer 's mind works , just the psychology of them , is pretty f -- king crazy .
I was definitely inspired by that , but most of that imagery came from my own mind .
I did everything I could to relapse into the old me .
When you relapse you go into your old ways harder than before . ''
