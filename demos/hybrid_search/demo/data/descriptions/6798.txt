Lauper co-wrote and co-produced this with Basement Jaxx .
The Sun newspaper July 25,2008 asked Lauper how she teamed up with the English dance music duo : She replied : `` My manager Lisa is a really big fan .
She turned me on to their music .
They have a very distinct sound and personality .
I love that about them .
Simon -LSB- Ratcliffe -RSB- and Felix -LSB- Burton -RSB- are so musical and inventive , like a pair of musical mad scientists .
We gave and took from each other .
A true collaboration . ''
