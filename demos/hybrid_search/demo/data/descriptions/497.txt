This song is about vengeance .
Vocalist Dexter Holland explained to Spinner : `` It 's the idea that something is coming back to you .
When I read those lyrics , it sounds like a military guy on a bombing mission , someone going after Osama , or someone getting tried for fraud .
The idea of vengeance in a pure adulterated way .
It 's an unapologetic eye for an eye .
People tend to temper that , but it 's about tapping into what that emotion is . ''
