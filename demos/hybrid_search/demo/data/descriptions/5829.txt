This Krautrock sounding instrumental is Weller 's most experimental number on the album .
Weller told Mojo magazine June 2008 : `` The track 111 was me , -LRB- guitarist -RRB- Steve Craddock and -LRB- producer -RRB- Simon Dine on three different keyboards , with our backs to each other , playing whatever we felt , without discussing it .
That was a new thing for us .
We would n't have tried that even a year or two years ago . ''
This was Paul Weller and Steve Cradock playing two different mellotrons with Simon Dine on the mini-moog .
Weller has said that it `` was really liberating not to have a standard chord sequence . ''
According to Weller , the British avant-garde rockers AMM inspired this .
