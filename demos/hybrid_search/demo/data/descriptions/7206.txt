This stirring ballad is the first single from Susan Boyle 's third full-length album , Someone to Watch Over Me .
The Scottish singer debuted the song on NBC 's America 's Got Talent on August 31 , 2011 backed by a full string orchestra .
Boyle explained the song 's meaning : `` This song makes a demand on God 's presence .
It raises questions as to whether or not He can be there when needed . ''
The choice of a song that questions God 's existence was a surprising one from the avowedly Catholic Boyle .
Co-writer Bjorn Ulvaeus is a member of the Swedish humanist organisation Humanisterna , though he describes himself as a `` freethinker , '' rather than an atheist .
ABBA 's Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus originally wrote the song as `` Du måste finnas '' for the 1995 Swedish musical Kristina from Duvemåla .
The show is based on a series of four novels by Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg set in the mid-19th century , which detail a family 's poverty-driven migration from Sweden to America .
The song 's music video was filmed at London 's Symphony Orchestra home on Old Street , north of the City of London .
We see Boyle rehearsing , as she prepares to perform the track live on television shows across the world .
