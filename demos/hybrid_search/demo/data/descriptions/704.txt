The first single from British Pop-Rock band The Feeling 's third album , Together We Were Made , was released on May 1 , 2011 .
Seven weeks later , the album was released on June 20 , 2011 .
Frontman Dan Gillespie Sells explained the song 's tribal feel in an interview with Digital Spy : `` I started with a Calypso beat and gave it a simple groove .
I wanted to get away from the standard starting points for the whole record , so I thought about the least fashionable thing I could do and I suppose that is what it was .
It always ends up being a simple pop song about love though - even if that 's not what I 'm trying to achieve . ''
