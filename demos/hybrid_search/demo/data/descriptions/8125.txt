Fiona told Billboard magazine that her goal with The MF Life was to give an `` honest '' depiction of her life and how things have changed from her debut set , 2009 's The Bridge .
This song about improving a relationship by breaking down the walls that both parties have put up is an example of the more empowering lyrical content of her sophomore release .
`` It 's basically telling stories that have never been told , that I 've experienced and grown from and learned from , '' she explained .
`` I think there 's a definite balance with the highs and the lows .
This time I 'm stronger .
I 'm better .
I 've been on the ` Wrong Side of a Love Song ' and I 'm doing better and you 're watching me work .
I 've got songs like ` Breaking Down These Walls ' that are definitely empowering on the leap to love from a partnership standpoint , being stronger for your partner .
People tend to remember the more heartbroken and sad records , but ... I wanted to give a little taste of all the different colors of what it is to fall in love with somebody . ''
