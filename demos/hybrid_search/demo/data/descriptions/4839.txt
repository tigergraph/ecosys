Jennifer Hudson recorded over 40 songs for the album , but only around a third made it onto the CD .
This was one of the first ones she set down .
Hudson told Los Angeles Times August 20 2008 about this Gospel flavored track with a futuristic beat .
Said Hudson : `` It was produced by Tank -LSB- a.k.a. Durrell Babbs -RSB- .
I 'm a huge fan of his , and I thought the song was a great idea .
I love the feeling of it .
It 's very modern , but it has the elements of R&B . ''
