In England , this was called `` Get It On -LRB- Bang A Gong -RRB- . ''
The title was changed on the American release so it would be less offensive .
This is a great example of `` Glam Rock . ''
There was nothing all that distinctive about Glam music , but it was characterized by the outrageous , often effeminate costumes the performers wore and the very theatrical stage shows .
In the US , this was the only hit for T-Rex .
They had several hits in England before Glam Rock fell out of favor .
The band released this a year after they shortened their name .
They had been Tyrannosaurus Rex .
In 1985 , the `` Supergroup '' Power Station , which included Robert Palmer and members of Duran Duran , released this as a single .
They used the original title on both sides of the Atlantic : `` Get It On '' -LRB- thanks , Brad Wind - Miami , FL -RRB- Blondie recorded a live version for their 1978 Parallel Lines album .
-LRB- thanks , Chrissy - Manchester , England -RRB- This is about sex , but most of the imagery is vague enough that many people did not pick up on it .
The last line , `` Meanwhile , I 'm still thinking ... '' was a nod to a Chuck Berry song called `` Little Queenie , '' which contains the same lyric and inflection .
-LRB- thanks , Bobo - Shrewsbury , England -RRB- Mark Volman and Howard Kaylen sang backup vocals .
Known as `` Flo and Eddie , '' Volman and Kaylen were members of The Turtles .
-LRB- thanks , paul miller - chandler , AZ -RRB- After falling from fame a few years after this came out , lead singer Marc Bolan was killed in 1977 when his girlfriend crashed their car into a tree .
Marc Bolan took his name from Bob Dylan ... BO from Bob and LAN from Dylan .
-LRB- thanks , Bob - Atlanta , GA -RRB-
