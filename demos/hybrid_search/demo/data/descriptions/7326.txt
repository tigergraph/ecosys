The line , ` ek bara mela ' in the chorus is a nearly literal Hindi translation for `` One Big Mob . ''
This song was part of a 12-minute movement the band was working on , and the ending was taken from the intro of another song they were working on called `` Stretch You Out , '' which they decided not to release on the album .
The crying baby vocals were provided by Dave Navarro 's little brother Gabriel James Navarro .
