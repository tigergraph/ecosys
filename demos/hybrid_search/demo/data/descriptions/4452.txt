This is the closing track from Lustre , the fifth studio album by British singer-songwriter Ed Harcourt .
The record has a lighter mood compared with his previous releases .
Harcourt told The Independent June 25 , 2010 that the addition of a baby daughter is partly responsible .
`` You ca n't help but be inspired by it , '' he said .
`` Being someone who evidently wears his heart on his sleeve , I tend to write about things that happen to me .
I try to put it in a way to communicate so people can relate to it . ''
Harcourt explained this song 's meaning to The Independent .
`` It 's just about trying to be that person and be more responsible .
It 's a growing-up album , I guess .
It 's so personal , it 's like an open letter to what was , when I wrote it , an unborn child .
It 's saying I 've changed a lot in the last four years -- I was always worried that if I matured I would become really boring and conformist and too comfortable .
I 'm a bit more zen about things , whereas I was a lot more hot-headed , knee-jerk , reactionary .
But I 'm still passionate about stuff . ''
