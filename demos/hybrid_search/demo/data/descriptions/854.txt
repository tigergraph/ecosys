Kooks vocalist Luke Pritchard penned this orchestral track high above the Atlantic Ocean .
He explained to The Sun : `` I always take my guitar on flights and I wrote this when I was on a plane to New York .
I sneaked into the toilet for a while to write it .
When I came out I thought the air hostesses were gon na give me grief .
But they were cool - even though I had been in there for two hours . ''
Kooks guitarist/pianist Hugh Harris arranged the strings on this track .
Pritchard explained the song 's meaning to The Sun : '' ` Time Above The Earth ' is one of the statements of the album .
It 's us doing everything differently .
The lyrics are moving away from what we 've done before - it 's a philosophical song about being above the world and thinking about life . ''
