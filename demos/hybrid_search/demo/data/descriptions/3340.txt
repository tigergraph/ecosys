This was issued as a double A-sided single along with `` Better In Time '' in the United Kingdom .
It was released in aid of BBC 's Sport Relief 2008 .
Lewis told the BBC : `` Footprints was actually a poem and it 's about standing by someone and being there for people who need your help . ''
In March 2008 this became officially only the second recording in the entire history of the UK singles chart to occupy two simultaneous chart positions .
It peaked at # 2 thanks to sales on CD and # 25 through online stores .
The only other song in history to manage such a feat was Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg 's erotic chart-topper '' ` Je T'aime , Moi Non Plus , '' which in 1969 was deleted by its original issuer Fontana records and in the same week re-issued by the independent Major Minor label .
The two singles were deemed separate products , resulting in the last available copies of the Fontana release charting at # 16 and the Major Minor issue debuting at # 3 .
This is an adaptation of the allegorical poem Footprints In The Sand .
Lewis said : `` I recorded Footprints In The Sand in the UK with -LRB- producer -RRB- Steve Mac and it 's a very special song to me .
Originally it was a poem ; it 's very inspirational so we put it into a song .
I think it is very moving , with a very emotional lyric and I really love to sing this song . ''
X-Factor and American Idol judge Simon Cowell had a co-writing credit on this .
Lewis explained to The Times March 8 , 2008 : `` He came up with the original idea to make it into a song .
He told me -LSB- about it -RSB- and I was , like , ` That could be really quite interesting . ' ''
