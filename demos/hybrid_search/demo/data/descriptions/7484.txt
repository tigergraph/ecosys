This is the only original song from Rod Stewart 's holiday album Merry Christmas , Baby .
Stewart penned the tune with his `` American Songbook '' producer David Foster and his daughter Amy .
`` That started out as a jam , '' Stewart recalled to Billboard magazine .
`` I started out singing the melody and I loved it , and I was so busy making my own album at the time and writing the lyrics for that I said to David , ` Can you get your daughter to write the lyrics , ' so she wrote the lyric and I did the melody . ''
Merry Christmas , Baby was the top selling festive album during the 2012 holiday season .
It shifted 862,000 copies from its October release to the end of that year 's Christmas period .
