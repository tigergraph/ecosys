Frontman Dave Mustaine explained that this song `` is about a bill that ex-President George W. Bush signed into law that gave him the power to put American citizens in concentration camps that are actually called ` detention centers ' here in the United States . ''
Endgame was helmed by Mustaine and acclaimed British producer Andy Sneap , who also manned the boards for 2007 's United Abominations .
The song is the title track of Megadeth 's twelfth studio album .
Mustaine said in publicity materials : `` Thematically , I 've never been known to be a silent bystander in a world that needs our participation .
As more is revealed about our former President 's legacy , a little-known yet staggeringly frightening document which was signed into law , named ` Endgame ' , has been uncovered .
The album Endgame is the most energetic music offering I have penned in over a decade and is far more believable than knowing someone signed ` Endgame ' - the document - into law .
The album is also the perfect ` ass-kicking ' music . ''
