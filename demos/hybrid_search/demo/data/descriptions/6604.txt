This is about the death of Elvis Presley , and how many people believe he is still alive .
The song also deals with the issues of fame , drawing parallels between Elvis and Citizen Kane -LRB- hence the ` Rosebud ' reference -RRB- .
This is the first single take from Kate Bush 's album Aerial .
It was her first release in 12 years , since her 1993 album The Red Shoes .
Bush 's 8-year-old son , Bertie , drew the picture on the cover of the single .
-LRB- thanks , Simon - Southampton , England , for above 2 -RRB-
