Stone Temple Pilots guitarist Dean DeLeo commented to Musicradar.com on this song : `` It 's psychedelic , man .
It 's fun , poppy , light-hearted , totally grooving - the flipside to STP that we do n't often show people . ''
The DeLeo brothers told Spin magazine how the songs for Stone Temple Pilots came together.Dean : `` They just began as things that I 've stumbled upon .
That 's what music is for me .
I never sit down to write .
I 'm just hit with something and it happens very fast , very easy .
If I try to sit down and write , it does n't really happen .
The album is a mix of songs we 've been kicking around for a little while and others that we 've written more recently , most on while on tour .
`` Robert : `` There 's no rules to writing songs .
I try to be the best person I can be in life , but there 's always times when I feel like I want to walk off a cliff .
And if I do n't walk off the cliff , at least I go visit the cliff and that 's where I choose to write songs .
It makes for good songs .
There are many different aspects in life to absorb from and extract from .
Being on the cliff always seems to be the best place for me . ''
Stone Temple Pilots marked the first time that Dean DeLeo and his bassist brother Robert had written together since Army of Anyone 's self-titled album in 2006 .
Dean explained to Musicradar.com : `` We were working on the song , and during a dinner break my brother Robert grabbed a Tele and asked Eric -LRB- Kretz , drummer -RRB- to lay down a single beat , and in a matter of minutes they had the song tracked .
It 's pretty much my brother 's song .
Even though I play the solo on the record , Robert wrote it .
The whole thing is very joyous . ''
