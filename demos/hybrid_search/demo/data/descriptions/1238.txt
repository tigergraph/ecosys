Frontman Guy Garvey told the Manchester Evening News that this song , `` is very simply about the morning after meeting somebody and falling in love . ''
He added : `` It 's what 's going through my mind while I 'm on the streets of Manchester .
It starts kissing her on the cheek as you leave her flat in the morning : ' I plant the kind of kiss that would n't wake a baby on the self same face that would n't let me sleep . '
It 's about not wanting to wake her up and going out into the world and noticing that everything is different .
It 's a very traditional love theme . ''
