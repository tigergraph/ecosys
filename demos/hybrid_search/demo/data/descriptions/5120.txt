Janet Jackson told newnownext.com about who she thought would love this track : `` Honestly the song was created for the gay community .
I kept stressing to Jermaine -LRB- Jermaine Dupri , Jackson 's boyfriend and head of urban music at Island -RRB- , ' I got to do something for the kids . '
I had talked about it on the last album - and there was a song that I had , and it was n't quite completed .
And I talked about it to the papers , gay magazines , and it did n't wind up on the album with the cut-off date .
I felt really badly about that .
So he just handed me a CD and said , ` Here are 10 tracks for the kids ; tell me which one you like the best . '
I fell in love with ` Rock With U. ' '' This song , written by Jermaine Dupri , Ne-Yo -LRB- as Shaffer Smith -RRB- and Eric M. Stamile , was used in the 2008 Tyler Perry movie The Family That Preys .
Mimi Marks , a Chicago-area transsexual entertainer , made a guest appearance in the music video for this song .
