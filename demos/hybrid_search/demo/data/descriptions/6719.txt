Moore wrote this with his frequent songwriting partners Brian Dean Maher and Jeremy Stover .
He told Great American Country the story of this song : `` I was at home watching the news with my dad and there was some guy on there griping about why we needed to get back to the Republican way of things .
Another guy said we needed to get back to the Democratic way of things .
My dad said , ` Who cares what way it is ?
We just need to get back to the good ole American way of things . '
I thought , ` Man , that 's a song title right there . '
When I came back to Nashville , we wrote that song and that 's one of those we wrote in a pretty short period of time .
The thing I brought up was , ' I wonder what my grandpa was thinking about at the time , paying $ 100 to fill his truck up ? '
That was our motivation , what our grandpas ' take would be on things . ''
