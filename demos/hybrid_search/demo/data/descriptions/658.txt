John Grant is a Denver-born solo artist and former lead vocalist of Denver cult band The Czars .
This is the title track of Grant 's solo debut album , on which he is backed by American folk rock band Midlake .
Grant told Mojo magazine that this track summed up the album 's theme of exposing his soul .
He explained : `` That 's my personality in a nutshell .
It 's about having a love-hate relationship with yourself , like , ` Yeah , sometimes I really do suck but so do you so f -- k off if you do n't like it . '
I 'm partly addressing myself but also the people that would say to me .
` You do n't deserve to have the same rights as others , to be treated as a human being . ' ''
Grant explained to The Sun April 16 , 2010 that this emotionally wringing ballad was inspired by his time in Denmark : `` When I first went to Copenhagen , I fell in love with the country , the people and especially the language .
That was sort of ironic , because I had always found the language to be quite ugly , but there I was in Denmark , meeting great people and falling in love with their ` ugly ' language.I enjoy incorporating all sorts of things into my songs that I like , and in addition to that I wanted to express at the end of the song ` The Queen of Denmark ' that I have absolutely no idea what I am going to become .
It could be anything and the Queen of Denmark is about as random as anything I could think of . ''
Queen of Denmark was Mojo magazine 's Album of the Year for 2010 .
