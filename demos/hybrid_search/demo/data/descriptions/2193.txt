The song 's lyrics are based on the Shipping Forecast , which is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the UK four times a day .
In the program , the waters around the British Isles are divided into a number of different areas and a weather report and forecast is given for each region .
In this song it is reported that a low pressure system is hitting Britain .
According to the Parklife booklet , this is in the key of E major .
Street recalled the recording of the song : to Q magazine April 2011 : `` It was the very last vocal we recorded for the album .
Damon had to go to hospital for an operation on a stomach ulcer or something the same day .
I remember him phoning me , drugged up post-up , asking how the mix was going .
It was right down to the wire , but it was the perfect final track for the album . ''
Producer Stephen Street told Q magazine March 2009 how he helped songwriter Damon Albarn to complete this song .
He recalled : `` We 'd recorded the music but the lyrics had been pushed to one side .
I kept nagging Damon to finish it but he was n't sure .
Eventually , his inspiration came from a piece of wrapping paper on a present Alex James had given him .
It had all the shipping regions on it with fantastic names like Cromarty , Fisher , Dogger and Lundy .
The song was down to a bit of wrapping paper and gentle persuasion from me . ''
This was included on the band 's 2000 Blur : The Best of album .
It was the only none single release to be chosen for the compilation .
