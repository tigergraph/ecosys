This is the first single from 2 , the second album by Black Country Anglo/American rock super group Black Country Communion .
The band 's vocalist Glenn Hughes told Musicradar.com he always saw this as the album 's lead single .
Said the singer/bassist : `` For me , ` Man In The Middle ' took the longest of everything to write because I knew in my heart that it would be the first single and video .
I had all the parts worked out in my head -- total British rock -- and knew I wanted to write a song about this f -- ked-up rock 'n' roll star .
Basically , it was going to be a ` story ' song , and the story was about myself .
It all sounds rather sad and desperate , but in the end it was a real joy to write , sing and perform , and I even had a good time making the video . ''
Regarding the way the band approached the recording of 2 , Hughes told Billboard magazine : `` I just figured the direction of the first one was continued on the second one .
We did n't want to do a Led Zeppelin III or IV and start playing acoustics .
We 're a rock 'n' roll band .
I just thought we should make it a big-sounding record that was fitting for rock 'n' roll , and the thread between -LRB- Black Country -RRB- and 2 should be very obvious . ''
