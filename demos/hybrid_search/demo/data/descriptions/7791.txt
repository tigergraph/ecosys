This is among the first Audioslave recordings .
Originally , Audioslave was named Civilian , and they recorded a 13-song demo titled , `` The Civilian Project . ''
There was high anticipation for a band featuring members of Rage Against The Machine and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden , and hackers got their hands on these demos , and spread them around file-sharing websites .
This , and the song `` Golden Visions '' were the only ones on `` The Civilian Project '' not to be part of Audioslave 's debut album .
This wound up getting released as a B-Side to `` Cochise . ''
