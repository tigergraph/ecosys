American hard rock band Duff McKagan 's Loaded 's third studio album , The Taking follows a non linear narrative , and this bright-sounding track tells the beginning of the story , despite being placed seventh on the track-listing .
McKagan explained to Gibson.com : `` The record is almost a backwards concept record .
It 's really the story of a break-up of two very dear friends that we witnessed as a band .
We were such good friends with both of them , the guy and the girl , and we watched the fracture and the deceit , the lying to yourself , the lying to the other one , the heartache , the heartbreak , the anger -- that 's why there 's ` Your Name , ' ` Follow Me to Hell ' and ` Lords of Abaddon ' -- then that kind of wishful thinking ... Like ` Man , it was always better somewhere else , ' and that 's where ` Indian Summer ' goes .
That first love . ''
