This Neil Thrasher , Tom Shapiro and Chuck Wicks written power ballad features some distinctive guitar played on an EVO .
Aldean explained to Billboard magazine : `` I 'm a huge Alabama fan , so to me it was always cool to show that you could do this and also do that , and do them both well . ''
`` When you go in , you do n't always have to reinvent the wheel with a song , '' he added , `` it can be just little things you change around in production .
That little backwards guitar , it 's just something that people just do n't use .
We have a wah wah on this record , and EVO and stuff that , people just think that ai n't cool to use any more .
I think it 's cool , nobody uses 'em any more , but we do .
And it just sounds different , it 's not so clean , it 's not so technically right .
I could go in and make a record that sounds perfect , but that gets boring to me after a while .
I want to hear stuff that 's different , that I ca n't hear on another record . ''
