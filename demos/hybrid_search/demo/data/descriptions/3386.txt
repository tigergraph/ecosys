English folk-punk singer-songwriter Frank Turner has had a privileged upbringing , thanks to his grandfather , the former chairman of high street retailer BHS , Sir Mark Turner .
Brought up in a manor house by his city investment banker father , Roger Turner , and mother Jane , the daughter of a bishop , Turner was educated at Eton alongside Prince William .
However , he does n't take for granted his fortunate start in life .
This song is a tribute to his late grandmother , who helped him develop a positive , individualistic attitude .
`` It does n't matter where you come from , '' Peggy whispers to Frank in a dream during the song 's chorus .
`` It matters where you go . ''
`` One of the things I do n't like about English culture is our obsession with people 's backgrounds , '' Turner told Spin Magazine .
`` I believe life is what you make of it as an individual . ''
The song is the first single from Turner 's fourth album , England Keep My Bones , which features him frequently exploring his feelings of home .
`` I like music that has a sense of place to it , and I 'm English through and through myself , '' he explained to Spin .
`` I always loved how Springsteen writes about New Jersey and I wanted to do the same for myself . ''
Turner remembers Peggy fondly .
`` She was totally awesome , '' he gushed .
`` She got me drinking whisky and playing poker at age 10 .
She passed away a long time back but I think of her often . ''
England Keep My Bones takes its title from a line in Shakespeare 's The Life and Death of King John .
Turner explained to Rock AAA : `` I do n't write albums to themes , but after they 're done , certain things emerge and the record has a lot to do with both mortality and Englishness .
When I stumbled across the quote it seemed to fit perfectly .
I wrote this record whilst I was on the road , as ever , but the recording only took us a couple of weeks , it was a good experience . ''
