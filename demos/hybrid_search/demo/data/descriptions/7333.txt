American hardcore punkers Converge surprised their fans with this song .
Rather than being a full-frontal assault , like the other cuts on All We Love We Leave Behind , it actually contains melodies !
`` Sonically , ` Coral Blue ' is different to a lot of other tracks on the record , '' said vocalist Jacob Bannon to Kerrang !
`` There 's a lot more space in the song and the structure is really different , but having said that , it definitely has things in common with songs we 've done in the past .
`` He continued : `` There are things on the You Fail Me record -LRB- 2004 -RRB- and even bits on our split with Agoraphobic Nosebleed -LRB- The Poacher Diaries -RRB- that foreshadow that song .
Although it 's not a brand new style of song for us , it 's certainly the best execution of it .
It 's a very confident approach to something that 's sonically different . ''
