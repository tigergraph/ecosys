Dr. Dog is a psychedelic rock band from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
Shame , Shame is their sixth album , which was recorded with the line-up of bassist and co-vocalist Toby Leaman , lead guitarist and co-vocalist Scott McMicken , rhythm guitarist Frank McElroy , keyboardist Zach Miller and drummer Eric Slick .
McMicken told Express Night Out about this opening track from the album : `` Toby wrote that song , but I 've talked about it a lot and I have my own ideas about it .
It 's kind of about the decadence of self-loathing .
There 's a certain character in there with these grand ideas and this extravagance behind his own suffering and alienation .
I always think of that song as a character in a lowly state , but it 's a social state , a lifestyle : ` I 'm on my own and I 'm free on the surface , but behind the surface it 's kind of a loveless and empty person .
So it is kind of that paradox : celebrate your own misery . ''
