Frontman Ian McCulloch mused on this song in publicity materials : `` Do you know who I am ?
is a phrase you dare n't ever say .
Its very tongue in cheek , but I 'm saying throughout the album that I know exactly who I am .
And I feel like rubbing your noses in it again .
I know what I 'm on about now .
Its more like if I was an actor , it would be like Jack Nicholson or De Niro , they just know what they 're doing .
But Id like to think I choose my roles better than De Niro I think that sense of confidence has been borne out by natural habitat .
Not that I 'm looking down on the audience , but physically I am .
I love it , but then I also think , What the hell is it all about ? ''
