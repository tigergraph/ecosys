This track about relationships was inspired by The Art of War , the warrior creed of the ancient Chinese military commander and author Sun Tzu .
Frontman Stephen Christian explained to Billboard magazine how the song reflects the philosophies of the book .
`` I was reading the correlation between those who strategize relationships and those who put actual emotions behind it .
Sun Tzu was so calculated .
Every move that he would make or that he wrote was basically how to approach your enemy , befriend him and strategize out a friendship .
It kind of felt like how cold and calculated relationships can be sometimes ; like , who has the upper hand .
Is n't that kind of defeating the whole point of a relationship , whether it 's a friendship or a girlfriend or a boyfriend or a marriage ?
If you 're trying to strategize and plan it out and read self-help books and figure out the other person , it seems like it takes out the whole allure of what a relationship really is . ''
