This is the first single from English alternative rock band Pulled Apart By Horses ' second album , Tough Love .
Bassist Rob Lee told NME why they chose this track to lead their sophomore release : `` This was one of the first ones that we wrote for the new album .
It 's a really immediate song and it 's a bridge from the stuff off our first album to what we 're doing now .
It was an easy choice for a single as it 's so direct and in your face and aggressive .
We 've road tested it a lot and it 's got a great reception so it 's great one to start the record with . ''
