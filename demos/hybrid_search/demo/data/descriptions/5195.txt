In this song Browne harks back to the '60s , when the nation 's hopes were raised by political figures such as the Kennedys and Martin Luther King and addresses the way the world has changed .
Browne explained to American Songwriter magazine : `` There is the impulse to be a force of good in the world .
There are a lot of loving , hardworking people with these impulses who need to pay attention to what 's being done in their name .
There was a moment when people let go of some of their optimism and idealism ... and a lot of things were n't really addressed .
They 'd killed King and Kennedy .
What was happening to us ? ''
