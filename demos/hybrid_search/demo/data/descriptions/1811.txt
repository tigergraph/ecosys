Lyrically , Little Broken Hearts is a break-up album in which Jones examines heartbreak from every angle .
The opening track finds her coming to a realization that the relationship is over on what is not one would have thought a `` good morning . ''
Jones told Spinner that she was in `` a good place '' when she came to write the lyrics for the album , having gone through the end of a relationship `` so there 's always material in there . ''
She added : `` You go through so many different phases when something ends , even if it 's a friendship .
It does n't even have to be a romance .
You 're angry or you 're sad or you want to get revenge .
There 's like this whole range of emotions that I think many people go through .
I think we kind of were exploring that a little . ''
