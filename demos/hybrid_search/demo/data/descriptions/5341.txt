This was originally intended to be the first US single by American pop and R&B singer , Kelly Rowland , from her third studio album .
However those plans were changed and on June 29 , 2010 two singles were sent to American radio stations .
`` Grown Woman '' was sent to urban/rhythmic radio and `` Rose Colored Glasses '' for pop radio .
The up-tempo song was written by Ne-Yo and produced by Stargate , and is directed at the haters on the singer 's back .
It follows in the footsteps of Rowland 's 2009 club hit collaboration with David Guetta , `` When Love Takes Over , '' by incorporating an uplifting piano riff over a dance beat .
