James Hetfield wrote this song about his mother who died from cancer .
He was struggling with his mother 's death and was looking for a way to cope with his loss and deal with the pain .
It has come to mean much more to many people , who relate to the message of general internal pain and loss and the inability to make sense or cope with it .
Metallica performed this with the San Francisco Orchestra in 1999 .
This version can be found on the S&M CD .
-LRB- thanks , alastair - sydney , Australia -RRB- The music video is based on a painting , and it recurrently shows scenes of the biblical character Adam committing his first -LRB- or original -RRB- sin .
It also flashes to numerous pictures of Jesus dying .
Because of the video , many people feel that it is a representation of redemption and the remorse one feels for having sinned .
-LRB- thanks , Bob - St. George , UT , for above 2 -RRB-
