This is one of two original songs on Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil 's third studio album Tattoos & Tequila , the title track being the other one .
The remainder of the record is mainly made up of covers of 1970s rock songs .
This song was written by bandmate Nikki Sixx and originally intended for Mötley Crüe 's 2000 album New Tattoo .
Neil told Reuters : `` Nikki had even forgotten about that song when I played it for him .
I think it 's just a classic song with a cool message and a cool vibe to it . ''
