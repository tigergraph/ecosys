Carolina Liar are a Swedish-American pop/rock band based in Los Angeles , fronted by the band 's songwriter Chad Wolf .
He explained in publicity materials the background to this moving song , which was inspired by a friend who suffered from manic depression : `` Every day when the sun came up , it was constant anxiety - something he could n't deal with , yet here it comes every morning .
It 's like watching the news every day .
Sometimes you have to lie to yourself and pretend that the world is a beautiful place , when what lies on the other side is just madness . ''
