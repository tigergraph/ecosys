Antony Hegarty explained to The Sun January 16 , 2009 that this requiem for the lost treasures of the natural world , `` describes how I feel about the vanishing aspect of the environment and thinking , ` This is my world ' .
The Earth is the greatest creative force that we know , she 's invented so many beautiful aspects . ''
Antony Hegarty expanded on this song in an interview with Rolling Stone .
He explained : `` I think a lot of theologies were obsessed with the idea of separating us from our dependence on the natural world and repositioning our dependence on some abstract sky god .
Nature was something innately feminine and innately evil ; the Eve element .
It 's the male archetype inside us all , which has gone completely crazy for at least 2,000 years and now has taken our entire ecosystem to the brink of collapse . ''
This was originally the lead track of an EP that was a Top 40 hit in a number of countries , including Australia , Sweden and Italy .
Hegarty discussed the line `` I need another world / This one is nearly gone , '' with Mojo magazine May 2009 : `` When the forests are all cleared there is no more space to dream .
My grandmother used to talk to me about the spirits living on the hills .
People that grow up in nature are aware of that . ''
