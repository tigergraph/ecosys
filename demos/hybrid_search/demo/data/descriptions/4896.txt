This is the title track from English singer-songwriter David Gray 's eighth studio album .
Gray recalled to The Daily Telegraph September 16 , 2009 scribbling lyrics to this song on the back of his hand and on his trousers driving home from his studio .
He explained : `` I had to pick up the kids from a play day and I became a bit obsessed , there were loads of mums around and I just sat in the corner scribbling on the back of an envelope .
I was ridiculously wired but that 's where you want to be , that sort of altered state , the song just unlocked things .
It 's about staying alive , to not be curbed by what you have to wade through day in and day out .
` Draw The Line ' is about escape , and that 's what I needed in my music .
It was time to take a wrecking ball to what was there and knock it down and start again . ''
Despite his previous success Gray wanted to escape on this album from a musical formula he felt was becoming stale .
As a result he parted with his long-time collaborator drummer Craig McClune , as well as most of his other band members and recorded Draw The Line with a new backing band .
Gray told The Irish Times August 8 , 2009 of the thinking behind the title : `` It 's the end of one thing and the start of another .
Because there was a chapter and it 's ended and now there 's a new one .
But also it 's like , ` do n't cross this line ! '
It 's confrontational , which is intentional .
That 's how I feel . ''
