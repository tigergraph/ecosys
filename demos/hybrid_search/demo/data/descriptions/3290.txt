`` Guitar Town '' is the CB handle for the city of Nashville , which is where Earle got the title .
Earle : `` I saw Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band on the Born In The USA tour , and it dawned on me ; he opened with `` Born In The U.S.A. , '' and it was like this , that 's what I need to do !
I need to write a beginning and an end for this record and then the rest of the songs will fall in to place .
So , I wrote ` Guitar Town ' specifically to open the record and open the show.I spent the early part of the '80s touring in a van , getting chased down Black Mountain Pass by a U-Haul trailer .
Truck drivers , or anybody that travels for a living , relate to that line ... the motel tan is no tan at all . ''
