This Southern Gothic number is a cover of a Richard and Linda Thompson song originally released on the duo 's 1978 album First Light .
Plant told Mojo : `` There 's not one bit of superfluous stuff in the lyric .
It 's beautiful . ''
Country-folk singer-songwriter Patty Griffin stands in for Alison Krauss as Plant 's vocal partner on this and other Band of Joy tracks .
Plant explained at a listening party that Griffin was recruited after Plant found himself a bit disappointed with the initial recording results .
`` It sounded like Moby Grape outtakes , '' he said .
`` I was in absolute heaven .
But I took it home and realized there was absolutely nothing that kicked up . ''
The singer called up Patty Griffin and asked her `` to add her Shangri Las-type vocals . ''
