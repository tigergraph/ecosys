This piano-laden song was the third single taken from neo soul musician Maxwell 's fourth studio album , BLACKsummers ` night .
Like several other tracks on the record , it has a melancholic vibe .
Maxwell told The Idolator that this reflected the ending of a relationship in his personal life .
He explained : `` Not that ` black ' is synonymous with dark , bad or messed up things , -LSB- but -RSB- it conveys a certain somber feeling .
That 's kind of why the record deals with break up ... real life affects your art .
I found myself in a situation where my expectations were not met .
Not that that person was messed up or anything -- sometimes reality comes and checks you , and I kind of got a reality check .
But it inspired a lot of creativity for the record .
Something that was kind of painful actually made my work more important and interesting to people in the world , so I 'm pleased about that . ''
On his VH1 Storytellers appearance , Maxwell explained : `` Fistful of Tears was definitely inspired by the war .
I hate that we 're fighting , I ca n't wait for the troops to come back .
The fact that we 're fighting a religious war is crazy to me .
Everyone should believe whatever they want to believe in - just do n't mess with me .
That 's what spawned it , but it 's also trying to express to someone that 's so beautiful and so amazing how great they are when they ca n't see how great they are . ''
This was Maxwell 's fifth Adult R&B chart-topper and his third in succession following `` Pretty Wings '' and `` Bad Habits . ''
When the song reached pole position Maxwell became the first solo male to link three consecutive # 1s .
The only other artist to achieve this feat is Alicia Keys who has done so twice .
