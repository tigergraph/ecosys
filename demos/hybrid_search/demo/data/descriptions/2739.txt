Corbin penned this song with Carson Chamberlain and Mark D. Sanders during a writing trip to Colorado .
He said : `` This was the last song we wrote out in Colorado .
We went out to eat and got home and decided to write one more song .
I describe this as a cross between George Jones and Steve Earle .
I like the lonesome feel .
I can imagine this song as a black and white movie . ''
