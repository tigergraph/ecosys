This song deals with suicide and a family coping with it .
All Time Low lead singer Alexander Gaskarth dealt with the suicide of his older brother .
The song is all about what happened , the effect it had on the family , the way his harsh words effected them , and the final plea to be together again : `` Sing me to sleep , I 'll see you in my dreams , waiting to say , I miss you , I 'm so sorry . ''
