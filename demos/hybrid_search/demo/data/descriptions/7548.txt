It was only after Jools Holland asked Tunstall to join his big band because of her voice that the Scot began , for the first time , to consider herself not just as a musician but specifically as a singer .
This graceful , gently orchestrated tune is evidence of Tunstall 's new confidence in her on-mic skills , which she demonstrated on Invisible Empire / / Crescent Moon .
`` This album is about singing , '' she stated , `` and it 's about my voice .
That was what I wanted to be the centrepiece of the album , which I 'd not done before . ''
