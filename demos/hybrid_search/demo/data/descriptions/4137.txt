Ill Manors is a soundtrack album by British musician and rapper Plan B released to accompany the film of the same name .
This tune is the first song heard in the movie .
The song 's working title was `` Fairydust . ''
This samples `` Aquarium '' by French classical composer Camille Saint-Saëns , which is the seventh movement from his musical suite , The Carnival Of The Animals .
Carnival was the product of a holiday Saint Saens had in February 1886 in an Austrian village hideaway .
He actually intended the work to be a musical joke , using material borrowed from other composers to characterize his fantasy zoo .
It was not published in full until after his death , reportedly because Saint-Saëns feared it would affect his reputation as a serious composer .
However , it is now arguably the composition he is best known for .
