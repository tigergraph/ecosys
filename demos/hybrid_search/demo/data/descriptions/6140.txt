Vic Fuentes writes most Pierce the Veil songs by taking raw personal experience and transforming it into poetic , indirect lyrics .
Even though they 're drawn from his life , the finished song is often left with an ambiguous , universal feel .
This is partly intentional , as Vic admits that he will censor and rewrite lyrics if they deal too explicitly with a real person .
This was the case with `` One Hundred Sleepless Nights '' , which is based on Vic 's on-again , off-again relationship with a woman over the course of several years .
As the two were finally reconciling and moving toward something that felt permanent , she got pregnant with another man 's child and moved away .
The song describes the night that Vic found this out.The song , despite being rewritten to avoid directly referencing the woman involved , is lyrically straightforward for Vic .
From start to finish , it simply describes the woman showing up and telling Vic she 's having another man 's child .
Vic 's characteristic poetic stylings , however , manage to show up between verses , as he imaginatively describes the savage emotions provoked by the experience .
Vic says that this is the most personal song for him on the album .
Vic Fuentes usually records his vocals with the rest of the band in the studio .
For this album , however , he recorded alone with a handheld mic .
This allowed him to run , jump , and crawl - much like a live performance - and sing entirely uninhibited , all to make his performance more emotive .
`` One Hundred Sleepless Nights '' appears on the Pierce the Veil 's 2012 album , Collide With the Sky .
The band extended their songwriting process for this album , taking over a year before they were ready to record .
Part of the album was written during a summer-long stay in a European cabin .
Band members said the solitude helped them focus on writing the best songs they were capable of .
