This is a track from Lost In Transition , the first studio album from the American Pop-Rock band Sixpence None The Richer in a decade .
The LP title is a reference to the band 's 2004 break-up .
`` It 's about things that happened in our lives recently , personal events or on a musical level , '' explained guitarist Matt Slocum , who founded SNTR with singer Leigh Nash in 1992 .
`` We had a transition to go through .
And now we have . ''
While Slocum has been the group 's primary songwriter in the past , Nash penned several tracks on Lost In Transition .
`` I show up as a writer a little bit more than I have in the past , '' she told Billboard .
`` So we tried to make it kind of conversational in the layout of it , one song potentially being a response to the other , even if they were n't written that way . ''
Nash wrote this song with her husband about the death of her father .
`` That 's a relationship and something I do n't mind at all baring for the world to see , '' she told Billboard magazine .
`` The pain of losing a parent , a lot of people can connect with that . ''
Nash told Christianity Today how she wrote this song with musician Stephen Wilson a few years before they married in 2011 .
`` Stephen , who has been a best friend for a long time , came to my dad 's funeral with me in Texas , '' she recalled , `` and that meant a lot to me .
It was a powerful experience for us to share that together and to be at that funeral .
Anyway , we got back to Nashville , and Stephen started writing the song .
And I do n't think I heard it for maybe a month or two , but finally he said , ` I 've got the chorus to a song , ' and it was so beautiful .
And then I finished the song with him and wrote the rest of the words .
It 's a beautiful ode to my father but through the eyes of Stephen , who at the time was my best friend . ''
