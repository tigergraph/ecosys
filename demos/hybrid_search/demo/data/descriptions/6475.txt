Shortly after seeing for the first time the shiny album cover containing an airbrushed photo of her , Clarkson blogged : `` It 's very colorful and they have definitely photo-shopped the crap out of me but I do n't care haha !
whoever she is , she looks great . ''
This was written by Sam Watters -LRB- formerly of the band Color Me Badd -RRB- , his songwriting partner Louis Biancaniello , and Dameon Aranda , the lead guitarist/vocalist of the band Aranda .
The trio also penned `` Whyyawannabringmedown '' on All I Ever Wanted .
In addition , Watters and Biancaniello produced `` I Want You '' and the bonus track `` The Day We Fell Apart . ''
Kelly Clarkson told The Daily Mail February 27 , 2009 : `` This has a soulful vibe , but it 's also a throwback to old-school rock .
That comes naturally to me , because I love Janis Joplin and Aerosmith . ''
Clarkson told Pop Justice that she thinks this is the best song on All I Ever Wanted as `` it 's different to anything else on the radio right now . ''
