The Performance , Dame Shirley Bassey 's first studio album of new songs in two decades , features eleven tracks each written by a different songwriter .
This romp about a woman tired of fairy-tale romance was penned by Canadian singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright .
`` It 's a relief , with all the tepid voices we have these days , to not worry if the artist can handle it , '' Wainwright told The Daily Telegraph October 28 , 2009 .
`` With Shirley , you 've got to think about finales , climaxes , strong opening lines : there 's nothing subtle about the process .
`` Producer David Arnold agreed .
`` She loves the big note , '' he said .
`` My job was almost like trying to make the journey interesting . ''
