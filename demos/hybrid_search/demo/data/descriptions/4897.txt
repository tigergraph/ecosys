Bassist Aristazabel Hawkes in the Daily Mail February 29 , 2008 : `` Fyfe -LRB- Dangerfield , vocalist -RRB- came up with the riff and I added the brass arrangement .
Our last album was very soft .

Frontman Fyfe Dangerfield told The Independent March 28 , 2008 : `` It definitely feels like the world is in a strange place politically and environmentally , you 're very aware that things could just go at any moment .
It feeds underneath a lot of the tracks .
There 's a lot of stuff that references death or war in some way or arguments , greed and lust and want - that theme of wanting more and more , and the after effects that has on other people .
` Kriss Kross ' came out of this place and had this real tense feeling .
I really like that you do n't expect it to go into a chorus like that .
It 's not the most upbeat record lyrically , but musically it is .
We seem to do that a lot . ''
