This is the second single to be released from rapper Snoop Dogg 's 11th studio album , Doggumentary Music .
The song was produced by Electro-pop duo The Cataracs , who are best known for their work on Far East Movement 's chart-topper , `` Like a G6 . ''
The song is an ode to oral sex , which Snoop says is a sequel of sorts to his 2008 hit `` Sexual Eruption , '' so it is unlikely the British royals will ever embrace the R-rated track .
A remix was made by David Guetta using the censored `` Sweat '' title .
The French DJ 's version was released as a single in the UK and across continental Europe , as well as Australia .
The remix samples Felix ' 1992 club hit `` Do n't You Want Me . ''
Snoop explained that the song was inspired by the announcement on November 16 , 2010 of Prince William 's engagement to Kate Middleton and his anticipation at being invited to play at the heir to the throne 's stag party : `` When I heard the royal family wanted to have me perform in celebration of Prince William 's marriage , I knew I had to give them a little something , '' he explained . ''
` Wet ' is the perfect anthem for Prince William or any playa to get the club smokin ' . ''
We wonder if Snoop is angling for a knighthood ?
An edited version , entitled `` Sweat '' was released to US urban radio stations on January 11 , 2011 .
