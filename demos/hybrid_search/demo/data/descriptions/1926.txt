This is the title track of Ben Folds Five 's fourth album .
The lyrics for the song came from some of author Nick Hornby 's unused material during his 2010 collaboration with Folds , Lonely Avenue .
Folds explained to FMQB : `` It was n't leftover because it was n't good , it 's just I could n't get to it .
He 'd written so much and I only got around to the 12 songs on the album . ''
The Sound Of The Life Of The Mind debuted at # 10 on the Billboard 200 .
In doing so it became Ben Folds ' first ever set to enter the top 10 of the US album chart , with or without the Five .
Folds told FMQB about the meaning of Hornby 's lyrics .
`` He was talking about a friend of his , the author Sarah Vowell , '' he explained , `` and was saying that sometimes the world can sometimes feel like a thuggish place , not all that friendly .
And up in your mind you can have your books , you can have any thoughts that you want , and that is kind of the story of his friend 's life .
There 's a big rock show going on outside and that 's awesome , but she 's kind of up in her head , which is far more dangerous and noisier .
It 's like Keats and Emerson and all these people are playing a Rock concert in their heads .
That 's kind of what he 's talking about . ''
