This Neil Thrasher , Wendell Mobley and Busbee penned song finds the protagonist driving around , listening to the radio .
Aldean explained to CMT : `` The song is just talking about those days when everything is going right and you do n't really want it to come to an end .
My favorite line is , ` Rest your feet upon the dash/Leave your toe prints on the glass . '
Those visual things , even something that simple , will grab me and make me want to listen to the rest of the song .
I ended up falling in love with the song . ''
The song came in at the end of the recording sessions for My Kinda Party .
Said Aldean to CMT : `` We were looking for some more tempo stuff , and that song came in .
To be honest with you , man , when I heard that song , it almost had like a Keith Urban vibe .
I do n't really know what you call it , but I call it kind of like a ` peppy ' song .
We 've never done a lot of that stuff , but I really liked the song and the melody . ''
