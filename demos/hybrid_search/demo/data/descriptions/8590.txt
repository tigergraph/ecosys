Esben and the Witch is a three-piece Gothic Rock band hailing from Brighton , England , comprising Rachel Davies , Daniel Copeman and Thomas Fisher .
They make doom-laden arty rock , led by Davies ' haunted vocals .
The trio named themselves after a Danish fairytale .
The eccentric Tesla 's life and work has fascinated a number of other musicians .
Other songs inspired by the Serbian scientist include OMD 's `` Tesla Girls '' and `` Astro '' by The White Stripes .
Also the American hard rock band Tesla took their name from the electromagnetism pioneer .
This apocalyptic swirl of love and bereavement was inspired by the story of maverick scientist Nikola Tesla , who loved nothing more than feeding pigeons from his hotel windowsill .
`` He developed a close relationship with this one pigeon , '' explained Fisher to NME .
`` But one day it did n't come back , and he said he would never work again , '' adds Dan .
`` It was the deepest relationship he ever had . ''
