Tyler Okonma , better known by his stage name Tyler , The Creator , is an American rapper and leader of the alternative hip hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All -LRB- Or Odd Future -RRB- .
The product of a broken home , Tyler 's cuss-packed , hate-filled and misogynist lyrics with jokes about rape and ` faggots ' have earned him a controversial reputation .
Syd `` Tha Kyd '' Bennett , the album 's mixer and part-time vocalist argued to UK newspaper The Guardian that his `` offensive words do n't deserve their value , their power '' , and that they 're just words .
`` He -LSB- Tyler -RSB- is n't necessarily saying , ' I want to rape so-and-so . '
They 're just sick , twisted fantasies that he 's had , based on girls that have hurt him in the past .
A lot of people have sick , twisted fantasies , so why not give them something to relate to ? ''
Goblin is Tyler 's second album , and first official release .
It continues the rapper 's dialogues with his fictional therapist Dr. TC first heard on Bastard .
The confessional title track finds him venting his darkest thoughts to his shrink .
But why ` Goblin ' ?
Tyler told The Guardian : `` I usually just say what I 'm feeling at the time , what I think is cool .
It 's sporadic .
It 's the first things that come in my head .
Like the word ` goblin ' , '' It randomly came to me .
Goblins are little mischievous f -- ks . ''
