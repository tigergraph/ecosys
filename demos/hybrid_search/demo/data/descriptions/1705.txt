Gary Barlow told The Sun November 21 , 2008 : `` The song is downbeat and about a best man at a wedding I went to about three years ago .
He had just split up with his partner and got drunk .
When he got up to make his speech he basically talked about himself for five minutes and how he 'd ruined his life .
Everyone was dying . ''
Take That 's album was released the same day as Britney Spears ' Circus set came out .
There was concern about both records sharing the same title .
However Take That 's manager told The Daily Record : `` The boys have worked on this for months , like Britney , and we certainly wo n't be changing the title .
When you work that far in advance , it 's impossible to know what people will call albums .
Erasure had an album Circus .
The name is not copyrighted .
I doubt there will be confusion .
Fans will either ask for the new record by Take That or Britney Spears . ''
Barlow explained the album title to The Sun : `` The album was called The Circus because the title visually connected the tour , the stadium sound and the big arms in the air .
We 're planning something extra-special .
It made sense to call the album The Circus even though it 's really the antithesis of the actual -LRB- title track -RRB- song . ''
The first week sales of The Circus were 432,000 copies , the third-highest total in UK chart history , behind Oasis ' Be Here Now -LRB- 1997 -RRB- with 663,000 copies and Coldplay 's X&Y -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 464,000 copies .
