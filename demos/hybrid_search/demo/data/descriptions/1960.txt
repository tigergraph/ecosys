The second single from Scottish rockers Frightened Rabbit 's fourth album , Pedestrian Verse , it was released on December 14 , 2012 through Atlantic Records .
Frontman Scott Hutchison told The Skinny magazine : `` This song took a while to get right .
This is version number five and I 'm so glad we did n't settle for the previous incarnations . ''
The song 's music video finds the band exploring that whole fascination with accidents .
It was filmed entirely in one take in a New York City convenience store .
Regarding the song 's meaning , Hutchinson told The Skinny : `` It 's a big , confident rock song about helplessness .
I like that juxtaposition . ''
Speaking about the song , singer Scott Hutchinson said : '' ` The Woodpile ' is about that night you felt utterly out of place , alone , awkward and cornered .
All any of us want in those instances is for someone we care about to come and take us away from it all .
It 's escapist , but also claustrophobic in places .
I like the idea of contrasting a big , confident piece of music with lyrics that express uncertainty and vulnerability . ''
