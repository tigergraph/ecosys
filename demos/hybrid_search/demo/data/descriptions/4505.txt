Rise Against have never been afraid to provoke with their lyrics , and this song finds vocalist Tim McIlrath crying : `` We ca n't feel the heat until you hold your hand over the flame / You have to cross the line just to know where it lays / You never know your worth until you take a hit / And you wo n't find the beat until you lose yourself in it . ''
McIlrath told Spin magazine : `` For a band that has always been against popular opinion and been thrown into the world of popular music -- it goes without saying our opinions will ruffle feathers . ''
