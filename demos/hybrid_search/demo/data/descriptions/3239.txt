This song reiterates what happened in `` Her Ghost In The Fog '' from their earlier album Midian , but with a new twist .
At the end of the song , you find out that he never avenged the death of his lover `` Clarissa '' by burning her attackers .
It was merely a dream of revenge he had in his jail cell .
