This is the biggest hit for the Deftones , who released their first album in 1995 and spent time opening for Ozzy Osbourne and Korn .
It 's one of their few songs to get airplay on MTV and radio .
According to thedeftones.com , this was written in Seattle during the hot summer of 1994 .
Trapped inside of his room by the heat and sun , Chino Moreno boarded up his windows with aluminum foil and wished for `` An apocalyptic-type thing '' where all of the people on the streets would disappear and the sun would go away .
He called this dreamworld `` his own summer , '' which is where the song title comes from .
-LRB- thanks , Sam - Champaign , IL -RRB- Some lyric analysis : `` Cloud come shove the sun aside '' - sadness against happiness .
`` And no sun in my summer '' - The bad luck of being sad and poor in this world .
`` There are no crowds in the streets '' - Loneliness caused by social discrimination .
`` The shade is a tool , a device , a savior '' - Living in the shade is a solution to get far away from this .
`` I try and look up to the sky , but my eyes burn '' - Someone wants to bring us down everyday .
`` Shove It '' - These people do n't care for anyone but themselves .
These people are the `` sky '' -LRB- because they 've got the cash -RRB- , and when we try to get next to them , we want to return to our shade and just say , `` Shove It . ''
-LRB- thanks , kristie - sydney , Australia , for above 2 -RRB- The video features a great white shark .
Chino Moreno told NME : `` I paid the bill for the director to go to Australia to collect footage to put in the video .
The actual sharks in the video were mechanical except the footage they Cgied in at the end . ''
