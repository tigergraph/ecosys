American punk rock band A Rocket to the Moon was founded during 2006 in Braintree , Massachusetts by vocalist Nick Santino as a musical experiment .
He had formerly fronted the local bands The Bad Year and The Midway Class .
After using local musicians to begin with , Santino eventually recruited guitarist Justin Richards , bassist Eric Halvorsen , and drummer Andrew Cook as full time members of the band .
`` Like '' was the band 's first single to enter the Billboard Hot 100 .
The song 's music video was filmed in Santa Barbara , California .
A Rocket To the Moon released their first full-length album , On Your Side on October 13 , 2009 .
This is the second single to be taken from the LP .
The band explained to Artist Direct that this is a `` good old-fashioned break up song , '' and it explores that `` difficult yet crucial process of growing up and eventually realizing that while the break up caused you pain , in the end , it was for the best . ''
