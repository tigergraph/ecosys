This was one of the first songs Metallica put together for their St. Anger album .
James Hetfield wrote the lyrics and described them to producer Bob Rock as being like Frankenstein , or `` Some kind of monster , '' which gave them the title .
The version released as a single was shortened from the album version .
The phrase `` Some kind of monster '' resonated with the band .
They had been through a great deal of turmoil , which was on full display in the documentary filmed while they were making St. Anger , which was fittingly titled Some Kind Of Monster .
In the TV show Supernatural , there is an episode where the character Dean hums this to calm himself down on a plane .
