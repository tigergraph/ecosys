This was written by Gretchen Peters , who was brought up in an area next to the thriving metropolis of Manhattan .
It was her childhood sanctuary , safe , simple , and , she says , a good place to grow up .
So when she was writing songs for her album Halcyon , she dipped into the well of childhood memories and came up with this song , which is a vivid description of how her home town feels to her .
`` I really just had some images about the town I grew up in .
It was a little town , even though we were right by Manhattan .
It was a good place to grow up .
I felt good there , I felt safe and protected , and I knew my neighborhood .
It felt small in the midst of a very big place .
And I just was sort of playing with the images that came up for me about that , about childhood and that town .
And I 'd had the verses pretty much written for a long , long time , but struggled a lot with the chorus .
I felt like these verses were very much just a Folk song , just a simple Folk song .
And I thought even for a while , well , if it 's a Folk song maybe it does n't need a chorus .
Maybe it 's just this .
And I just struggled with the chorus for a long time .
And finally it came to me that it was just as simple as saying if that 's what Heaven 's made of , I 'm not afraid to die .
There was n't anything more to it . ''
This song has become a popular one to play at funerals , probably due to the picture-postcard image it paints of Heaven .
However , Peters wrote this song with the intent of conveying what her childhood meant to her , and says , `` It was n't anything in particular .
It was just a sort of a memory , or a lot of memories , of what that idyllic time was like for me , and I felt , well , that 's Heaven .
What it ought to be . ''
