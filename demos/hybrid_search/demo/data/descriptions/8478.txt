Just Jack explained this song to Digital Spy : `` It 's basically trying to say that we 're all roughly on the same level and it 's good not to forget that too much .
It 's also about how confusing modern life and the media is .
Whenever someone tells you something , there 's always someone else telling you the exact opposite .
Statistics are always rigged to veer the way the person making them wants them to veer .
It 's also about trying to have hope and positivity in the face of all the s -- t things that go on in the world . ''
On this song Just Jack loops his vocals so he is performing a round with himself .
He explained to The Independent August 29 2009 : `` I 'd seen some Steve Reich thing on TV which had a similar effect .
I recorded the vocals after a few beers with mates .
They were giggling as I sang on my own like a choir boy , but when I played it back , they were like , that really works . ''
This was the lead single from the album All Night Cinema .
Just Jack told The Independent on Sunday April 5 , 2009 that the movies are one of his lyrical touchstones .
He explained that the lines for this song , `` came to me when I 'd been watching a lot of war films . ''
