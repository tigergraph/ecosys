This instructional tune was produced by Hit-Boy , who has also worked on tracks by the likes of Eminem , Jennifer Lopez , Lil Wayne and The Throne .
He wrote the song with the American singer-songwriter Priscilla Renea , who has also penned hit numbers for Selena Gomez -LRB- `` Who Says '' -RRB- .
The song finds sexpert Rihanna giving her men instructions .
Its one of a number of tracks on Talk That Talk that focuses on the Bajan singer getting frisky with different guys .
Hit-Boy told MTV News why Ri-Ri is so intent on satisfying her carnal desires on the album .
`` I mean it 's called Talk That Talk and she 's definitely talking that talk -- especially , I know , from my record , '' he said .
`` It 's called ` Watch n ' Learn , ' and people will understand what it 's about once it comes out .
It 's a very sexy record , but it 's fun .
It 's -LSB- got -RSB- great melodies ; it 's catchy ; the beat knocks .
It 's so many different elements to it . ''
The track was n't originally earmarked for any artist in particular when Hit-Boy started working on it .
`` I kind of went into the situation blind , but I had this track I actually started at home , and the one day I was at the studio with this amazing Priscilla Renea , and I was going to tell her to go home , but I was like , ` Stay here and see if you could come up with an idea for this , ' '' he recalled to MTV News of the song 's origin .
`` And by the time I got back to the house she sent me the idea through iChat , and I was like , ` Man , this is crazy . '
So we got it to -LSB- Rihanna -RSB- , and they went crazy , and she cut it , and that 's what it is ! ''
