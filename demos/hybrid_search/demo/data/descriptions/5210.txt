Speaking to LA rock station 106.7 KROQ , guitarist Chad Gilbert said this song is about the self-admonishment that comes at the end of a romantic relationship .
`` I think , lyrically , ` Dumped ' is one of the most straightforward songs of the album .
It 's kind of saying that you realize after everything went down that you 're better off without the person , but you do n't like it because you went through so much crap and the relationship is now over , '' he explained.Gilbert continued : `` After all you went through ; after seeing the person 's true colors ; after them breaking your heart , you realize , ` Damn .
You did n't even need this person anyways . '
If you knew that from the beginning ; if you were stronger in the beginning , you would n't have been with her .
You would n't have become so attached .
This song is sort of like kicking yourself in the a -- .
Like , ` C'mon .
Why did n't I realize that back then ? ' ''
