In this song , we hear from a man who hates leaving for work because he has to leave his girl behind .
At the end of the song , we find out that it 's his 3-year-old daughter .
Brotherhood of Man 's founder/manager Tony Hiller wrote the song with group members Martin Lee and Lee Sheriden .
Hiller told us : `` The three year old in ` Save Your Kisses for Me ' was every three year old in the world who had a dad running off to work , and who kissed them goodbye . ''
Hillier has admitted that his payoff was a homage to the Ames Brothers ' 1954 song , `` The Naughty Lady Of Shady Lane . ''
It 's last line reveals the `` naughty lady '' to be an infant of nine days old .
This won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1976 , with Brotherhood of Man representing the United Kingdom .
The victory helped the song become a worldwide hit , and it even cracked the American charts , becoming the group 's first Top-40 since `` United We Stand '' in 1970 .
Says Hiller : `` Regarding Eurovision , this was the second Brotherhood of Man and totally different to the original .
I had put this new band together the previous year , and recorded a song ` Kiss me Kiss Your Baby . '
It had been a big hit in Europe and I feel sure it helped us win the final so convincingly .
It was in fact the biggest winner ever - we sold 5 million singles and it was # 1 in 27 different countries . ''
