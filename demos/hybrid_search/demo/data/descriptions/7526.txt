Hawley gets downright raw on this rocker , borrowing the riff from the Stooges ' `` 1969 '' as the Sheffield singer tries to entice his missus out into the country for some sexual shenanigans .
`` Wo n't you follow me down , down into the woods ... come back feelin ' good , '' he sings .
In the press release announcing the details of Standing At The Sky 's Edge , Hawley said : `` I wanted to get away from the orchestration of my previous records and make a live album with two guitars , bass , drums and rocket noises ! ''
Asked by The Sun what he meant by ` rocket noises , ' he replied : `` The rocket noise thing was how I described the mental sounds Johnny was getting from his keyboards and it just sort of stuck . ''
The song was inspired by the meditative long walks Hawley took through the woods , hills and valleys near Sheffield with his dog during the period he was writing the album .
This was the first tune Hawley penned for Standing at the Sky 's Edge .
The singer told Q magazine that he wrote it , `` in response to the complete outrage I felt at one of the first things this government wanted to do - sell all the woodland off to their chinless f -- ing mates . ''
