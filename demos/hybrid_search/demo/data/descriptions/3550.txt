Editors Frontman Tom Smith wrote this breakup ballad after betting he could write a tune for a former X Factor contestant .
The unnamed singer got dropped and Smith kept the song for band .
Smith told The Sun that the confidence his family have given him is reflected on this song .
`` I 'm singing falsetto on ` What Is This Thing Called Love , ' '' he said , `` and would never have tried that before .
It 's vocally ambitious and I 've really stretched myself as a singer . ''
Smith has been in a relationship with the mother of his children , BBC Radio 1 DJ Edith Bowman , since 2005 .
He told Digital Spy that just because he had n't gone through a break-up recently , it does n't mean he ca n't write a sad song .
Said the singer : `` The tortured artist thing I think generally is nonsense - there are very few examples of that when the art is any good , at least !
I obviously like writing about things that are darker than what 's in or anywhere near the charts .
I just try to find interesting ways about writing around the topic -LSB- of love -RSB- .
They 're the most straightforward lyrics I 've ever written . ''
