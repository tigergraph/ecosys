This track finds Morissette mulling self-doubt and the help one needs to get out of that vicious circle .
`` The most important theme here is the last line of the chorus , the whole idea of reaching out to someone , '' the Canadian songstress told Spinner .
`` Yes , personal empowerment and personal connection with spirit and self - let 's foster that .
And let 's foster personal responsibility .
That 's lovely , high fives .
But we 're social creatures .
A sense of autonomy is lovely , but forgoing interdependence for some steely independence forgoes the opportunity for intimacy , connection , love and the healing of the planet . ''
