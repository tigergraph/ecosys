On January 20 , 2011 Alan Jackson and his record label , Sony , parted ways after over 20 years .
Three months later a new joint venture between Capitol 's EMI Records Nashville and ACR -LRB- Alan 's Country Records -RRB- was announced .
This is the debut single from the new deal , which was shipped to Country radio on June 13 , 2011 .
When asked about the story behind this song during an interview with Country Weekly , Jackson replied : `` It 's just a fun summertime song - I had something to drink one time and a bug flew in it and I kinda made a note of that .
Some people have asked if I was sitting someplace warm or near a beach when I was writing it , but I was actually in Nashville and it was pretty cold ! ''
Said Jackson of the this self-penned song : `` Seems like every time you turn around lately there 's just something heavy going on in the world , so I felt like singing something that was kind of light and fun . ''
