Ben Savage of Whitechapel spoke to us about a nightmare he once had where the band had to go into the studio with no material .
In reality , though , `` we 're always writing , '' he said .
`` We always have ideas .
`` This song was based on a different dream - one that came to their lead singer Phil Bozeman .
In the dream , the singer was in the middle of an endless line of people that stretched past the horizon , and no matter how hard he tried , he could n't escape .
A New Era of Corruption was Whitechapel 's third album , and their first non-concept album .
Instead of a concept , it focuses on very personal lyrics penned by Phil Bozeman .
It charted at # 43 on the Billboard 200 , and was praised for the new thematic direction and increased maturity evident in the songwriting .
The song harnesses the surreal imagery offered by Bozeman 's dream and uses it as a metaphor for existence .
It describes being in the line from a first-person perspective , and laments how everything is endless and meaningless .
Musically it 's a thunderous , heavy piece of metalcore than trails away into acoustic fingerpicking and ominous drones for the last 10 seconds , ending the song -LRB- and the album it appears on -RRB- on a dark , forlorn note .
