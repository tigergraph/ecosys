This is the first song made freely available to the public from alternative rock singer-songwriter Liz Phair 's sixth album , Funstyle .
Phair released the record herself , without the involvement of a label .
It is available by download linked through Phair 's website .
The song finds Phair documenting some of her less successful attempts to make money in the music business and how she ended up doing TV scores out of broke desperation .
It includes lines about attempting to decipher her publishing deal with CBS , for whom she scored the short-lived television show Swingtown .
`` Pulled out the contract from the file cabinet on microfiche in the form of tablets made of stone , '' she raps .
