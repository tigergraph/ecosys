The Arctic Monkeys surprised their fans when they posted this song to their website on March 4 , 2011 .
Drummer Matt Helders explained it was not a single , just a tease of what is coming .
Six days later the band announced the details of the English rock band 's fourth studio album , Suck It and See .
Alex Turner told the story of the song to NME : `` We were in Miami on tour once and we just got off a long flight to there and we had an idea for a song called ` Brick By Brick ' and so we wrote it that night just sorta in a bar .
But it was quite loose , we thought about it as the concept of a song and all these things that you want to do - brick by brick - and we just made a list of them that was probably three times as long as what it ended up over that night and the next few weeks . ''
Produced by their frequent collaborator James Ford , the psychedelic stomp goes straight for the jugular .
Eschewing much of his usual wordplay , singer Alex Turner crows , `` I wan na rock 'n' roll / Brick by brick ! ''
