Roberts penned this song with Joseph Mount of Metronomy .
The lyrics are a list of insecurities and observations , set against a sitar and some synth noises .
She told The Guardian that it 's her favourite song on the album .
`` I love it .
It sounds like a funeral song .
When we first started working , there were loads of tracks , and some were really commercial .
I think -LSB- Joe -RSB- assumed that was what I was going to do . ''
Roberts has described this as `` a funeral song . ''
The Independent asked how her record label reacted to such a deathly curio ?
She replied , with knowing petulance : `` At first , management were like , ' I do n't get it . '
But I was like , ` Well it 's not your album . ' ''
Both Roberts and Girls Aloud are signed to Polydor , which is owned by Universal Music Group .
Some reviewers have queried if there 's an additional meaning to this song 's lyric , `` I do n't like that you wo n't let me speak controversially / Because you think that it wo n't sit well universally . ''
