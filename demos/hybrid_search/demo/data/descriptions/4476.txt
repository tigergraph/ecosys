In this song Browne conveys a sense of despair at the injustice of political conflict , in particular the American government 's enthusiasm for the Iraq invasion in 2004 .
Browne told American Songwriter magazine : `` That was inspired by reading about these Bay Area drummers , who were against the war and wanted to put a band together .
It was very groovy , but I had this idea that I wanted to put big loud drums on there ... It works so much better .
I 'll write a song by myself , and come back and play it for the band , then find out I do n't really wan na hear two verses before the chorus . ''
On this song , Browne was backed by Chavonne Morris and Alethea Mills , who also sang on his 2002 for The Naked Ride Home album .
Browne originally met the two vocalists in early 2001 while working with the Washington Preparatory High School choir in Los Angeles .
