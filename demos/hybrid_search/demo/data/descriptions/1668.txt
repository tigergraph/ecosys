This is the title track of the seventh major label , full-length studio album from Contemporary Christian Music band , MercyMe .
The record is part of a `` pay it forward '' campaign centred on the record 's fictional benevolent leading man and features a theme of loving others well .
Guitarist Mike Scheuchzer of MercyMe said , `` It 's so easy for us to live in our own little self-absorbed bubbles .
We forget that above anything else we are called to love our neighbors , to reach out , to engage even the unlovable around us .
It 's not an option if we really want to be like Christ .
The Generous Mr. Lovewell is a picture of the change we want to see in our own lives .
Without love like this , everything we do , everything we are , is in vain . ''
