This song finds Yeasayer targeting someone making music for all the wrong reasons - `` The emperor 's standing naked .
How much longer can he fake it ?
, '' seethes vocalist/keyboardist Chris Keating .
`` It 's a very direct lyrical attack , but I 'd prefer not to say who it 's about , '' guitarist/keyboardist Anand Wilder told UK newspaper , The Guardian .
`` Ira has some idea who it 's about .
But it 's also directed at ourselves and this idea of buying into your own mythology and the danger it can bring -- just being so egomaniacal and not caring about the little guy , but pretending that you do . ''
Yeasayer Guitarist/keyboardist Anand Wilder told Complex magazine that musically , the band , `` were trying to pack as many influences as we could into one song .
It 's kind of schizophrenic .
It goes all over the place .
It 's a little bit of a throwback to our psychedelic era , with the swirling , 12-string guitars . ''
