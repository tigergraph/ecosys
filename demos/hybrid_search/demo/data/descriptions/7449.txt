This song is a tribute to Toby Keith 's hard-working grandmother and her nightclub in Fort Smith , Arkanas , which the singer previously referenced in his biographical hit `` Honkytonk U. '' He explained : `` My Grandmother passed away when she was 86 ; she was like Miss Kitty and ran a supper club/night club in Fort Smith for years .
So when I was a kid , some of the earliest memories I have of being on this earth were going by her night club and seeing my Grandmother .
I spent a whole summer with her , and years ago I wrote the song ` Honkytonk U ' about it and her buying me a guitar .
This song is a tribute to her . ''
Keith explained the song title : `` The name of the bar was Billy Garners ' Supper Club , but it was n't fitting into my song very well .
My Grandfather had nicknamed her Clancy because she was a saloon keeper , and always called her Clancy around the house .
So I used Clancy 's Tavern .
I give you the visual and everything you see when you go in the door .
There 's nothing made up in this song .
Every bit of this is word for word , exactly what you would have seen if you went in the front door at 5:00 and stayed all night long .
It 's a pretty special song to me . ''
