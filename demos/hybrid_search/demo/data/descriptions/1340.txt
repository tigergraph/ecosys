Don Henley -LRB- from an AOL Chat -RRB- : `` The song is basically about the growing inability of people to recognize evil .
It is about the age of Cultural Relativism that we are living in .
The title is taken from an old Hollywood apartment/hotel that existed from the late 20 's until the late 50 's . ''
