During an interview with Broward Palm Beach New Times , Stump was asked what is the favorite lyric is on Soul Punk ?
He replied : `` There 's a lyric on a song called ` Coast ' where I say ` Pointing out trivia nearly broke me with tragedy , so you need to put me back together . '
It 's kind of wordy and it 's not really that poignant , but it 's nice to have some kind of catharsis for once .
I was being the voice for someone else 's for a long time and I do n't really get to say these kind of things , so that was nice .
That 's a lyric that sticks with me . ''
