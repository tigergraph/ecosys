This song is about the media intrusion into people 's personal lives .
Radiohead were struggling to make the song work until guitarist Jonny Greenwood had the idea of approaching veteran Jazz trumpeter and broadcaster Humphrey Lyttelton to help out .
Lyttelton spoke to Q magazine April 2008 about the collaboration : `` Jonny Greenwood wrote to me saying , you may think this is an awful cheek , but we 've got this track that we 're having difficulty with .
We met up in the BBC canteen , and because I knew they were sensitive about being dubbed gloomy I was hesitant in saying the feel of it would be New Orleans funeral music .
I suggested a Louis Armstrong version of ` St. James Infirmary Blues , ' which is very much in that vein and he said , That might be it .
I turned up with my band and we just blew for seven hours with a couple of tea breaks .
Every now and then Radiohead disappeared into the control room .
We saw them waving their arms about and in the end , my chops were sagging , and I said , Genuinely , I think this is it , we 've got it .
Thom -LRB- Yorke -RRB- had spent quite a lot of time standing on his head in the little booth - or at least he went into positions of meditation - and he said to me , I think so ... we 'll have something to eat and then do some more .
I said , No , we will not ! ''
According to Q magazine April 2008 the line `` she is papering the windowpanes '' is a reference to a story Yorke heard about a celebrity driven to covering her windows with newspapers .
