This is the title track from American singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw 's fourth studio album .
The song finds DeGraw fantasizing about another guy 's girl .
He told Billboard magazine many of the songs on the album `` ride the vulnerability spot . ''
The singer had to balance up writing about emotion and hoping to get `` a reaction from the female listener '' without chasing the men away .
`` There is always that risk , '' he noted , `` and trying to get that correct is a fine line .
Some people will hate you for sounding vulnerable at all , so you ca n't win 'em all , right ?
You have to accept that stuff ... The things that make writing challenging are things that make it the most enjoyable . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Lenny Bass and shot in Brooklyn .
It features Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Genevieve Morton , who feeling unappreciated by her less than enthusiastic boyfriend , grabs DeGraw on her way out .
We made a pretty steamy video and , yeah , it looks really great , '' DeGraw told Billboard magazine .
`` It was rock 'n' roll . ''
