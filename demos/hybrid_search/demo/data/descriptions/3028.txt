Guitarist and principal songwriter Serge Pizzorno told Q magazine this breezy electro floorfiller was inspired by being in a club in Paris and hearing French electronic music duo Daft Punk .
He said : `` I had this riff that reminded me of my raving days .
It 's about being in a flash club full of rich men , looking at the clock and missing home a bit .
A simple sentiment amid the madness . ''
