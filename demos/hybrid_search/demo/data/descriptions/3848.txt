This is the opening track from Welsh alternative rock band Lostprophets ' fourth studio album , Betrayed .
Initial recordings for the record were scrapped in early 2008 at a cost of # 500,000 .
`` We made one album , and then scrapped it .
We just got a gut feeling , '' vocalist Ian Watkins explained to XFM .
The band also left their US record label , Columbia , who were unconvinced of the quality of the new material .
Both the album title and this opening track are indicative of Lostprophets beleaguered mindset arising from Betrayed 's painful , protracted birth .
