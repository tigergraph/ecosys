Filthy Dukes are a synthpop band from London , England .
This song was taken from their debut album Nonsense in the Dark .
This song features She 's Got Me Dancing singer Tommy Sparks .
Olly Dixon -LRB- sampling , electronic percussion , electric guitar -RRB- told Gigwise why Filthy Dukes hooked up with the Swedish artist : `` This is our big , unashamedly pop moment .
We recorded the music and just knew it needed a great pop vocal .
Tommy Sparks is a really talented writer and singer , somewhere between Talking Heads and Prince .
He sent back his vocal after a one night and we just knew that was it .
It scared us a little with how pop it was but we loved it , still do , it 's our Italo pop moment . ''
