The artist states that the angels burn inside `` for '' us while the devils burn inside `` of '' us .
This makes it seem as if the devils are intrinsically inside and a part of us while the angels -LRB- representing good -RRB- are an outside/exterior factor trying to work its way inside of us .
The writer of this song definitely knew what he/she was writing about - no one could write such a deep emotionally charged song without experiencing it in life first .
-LRB- thanks , Live Freak - Beirut , Lebanon -RRB- This song was used in a very emotional scene in the TV show Smallville - episode 2.8 - `` Ryan . ''
-LRB- thanks , Stee - Kent , England -RRB-
