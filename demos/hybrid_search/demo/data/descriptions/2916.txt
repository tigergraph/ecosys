This was the first song that HIM frontman Ville Valo started writing for Tears On Tape , but he struggled to complete it .
`` We nearly did n't include it on the album , '' he told Artist Direct .
`` It was just an acoustic and really bulky .
I could n't find the right way to present it with the band . ''
`` I started working on that straight after we toured Screamworks : Love in Theory and Practice , Chapters 1-13 in 2010 , '' Valo continued .
`` I wanted to see how far I could take a melody .
That song keeps going forward .
On occasion , it comes back to the refrain .
It 's as sad and melancholy as everything we do -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
I think the lyrics are pretty direct and fairly straightforward .
There 's no hidden meaning .
It 's one of my favorite songs .
It 's more prog-y .
There are a lot of things going on .
It 's great to have songs that get you going immediately , but it 's also cool to have some growers that may take a while .
Usually , those are the tracks that , let 's say , the loyal hardcore fans will gather around over the years and appreciate .
At the end of the day , it would be super boring to have balls-to-the-wall songs from beginning to end .
It 's good to have something more surreal and challenging in between . ''
