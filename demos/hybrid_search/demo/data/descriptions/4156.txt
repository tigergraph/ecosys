This spartan , plaintive track finds the Söderberg sisters recalling their youthful optimism when they started writing songs .
They explained to The Sun : `` In a lot of ways that song is like a New Year 's resolution .
It 's about being naïve and how in some ways being naïve can be positive .
When we started out we were young and naïve enough to think that we could make music and write songs , so we did . ''
The Söderberg sisters selected the name First Aid Kit at random from an English dictionary but they had reasons for their choice .
They explained to The Sun : `` First of all it 's simply a band name , but for us music is a form of therapy , a way to get through life .
We listen to music when we need consolation and support .
Music makes us feel less alone .
We 'd like our music to work as a plaster for the soul for our audience -- a musical first aid kit . ''
