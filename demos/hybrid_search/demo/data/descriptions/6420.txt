Brent Smith sings on this track , `` If they wan na take our picture tell 'em I do n't give a f -- k ! . '
This is the first instance on any of Shinedown 's four albums where the vocalist has used profanity in his lyrics .
`` It shocked me too , '' admitted Shinedown drummer Barry Kerch to Bravewords.com : `` We cuss like sailors out here on the road , but Brent 's grandmother would slap him every time .
It surprised me that he put it on the record , but it was what he was feeling at the time , what he had to get off his chest .
He does n't cuss just to cuss ; he does n't want to put it in songs just to put it in songs .
That 's why you have n't heard it on Shinedown records .
For some reason this time he had to get it out , so he did . ''
Kerch explained the song 's meaning to Alternative Addiction : `` It 's about modern technology and kids getting lost in it .
They do n't go out and play anymore , you do n't see them running around parks anymore .
They 're just tapping on their consoles all day long .
But hey we 're as guilty , although we 're stuck on a bus , but kids should get off and walk , get out and see something .
Kids often seem lost in this fake world .
People on Facebook are n't really your friends ; I 've got proper friends and I do n't need a Facebook account . ''
