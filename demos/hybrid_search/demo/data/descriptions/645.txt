This foot-stomping bluesy track finds Underwood singing of a love-stricken girl unable to escape her addiction .
`` I just ca n't leave love alone , '' she sings .
Producer Mark Bright removed a lower male voice from the mix of Country harmonies on the chorus , as he felt it made it sound too much like the Oak Ridge Boys .
Songwriting credits go to Hillary Lindsey , Gordie Sampson and Troy Verges .
Nashville mainstay Hillary Lindsey and Canadian singer-songwriter Gordie Sampson frequently write together , usually with a third person .
Amongst the songs they 've penned for Underwood are `` Jesus , Take The Wheel , '' which won them a Grammy Award for Best Country Song , along with Brett James .
For `` Leave Love Alone '' they teamed up with Louisiana native Troy Verges , who previously contributed to Underwood 's 2007 single `` Wasted . ''
