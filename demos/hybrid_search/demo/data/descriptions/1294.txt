Dave Grohl has admitted that most of the lyrics make no sense and have no real meaning .
Said Grohl : '' ` Wattershed ' is a inspired by my love of Hardcore and old-school Punk Rock . ''
-LRB- quote courtesy : www.fooarchive.com -RRB- Since this is such a fast , angry song , Dave Grohl decided once as a joke to do it acoustic .
He played it live , but changed the lyrics and sang in the vocal stylings of Fred Schneider of the B-52 's .
This rare version of the song is referred to in the Foo fanbase as `` Watter-Fred . ''
-LRB- thanks , Bert - Pueblo , NM , for above 3 -RRB- Dave Grohl references a couple of his favorite old-school Punk bands in this song : Black Widow and Flowerhead .
