Guitarist Anthony Armstrong spoke to Artist Direct about this song : `` Being burnt by someone is n't the best feeling , '' he said .
`` This song talks about the ` what if ' factor .
If we could just get over all the hate and the pain , how much better off would we be ? ''
Armstrong told Artist Direct that `` there is a bit of angst '' in the lyrics so `` it felt natural to make it heavy . ''
According to the guitarist it is `` the fastest tempo we have ever written a song to . ''
He added that the band felt that `` our typical string elements '' was a good fit for the track .
