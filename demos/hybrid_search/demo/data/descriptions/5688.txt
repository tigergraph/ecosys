Guitarist Brad Delson came into the studio bus where vocalist Mike Shinoda was working with the idea for this .
Brad recorded scratch guitar tracks for `` Faint '' over a click track -LRB- no drums , no music -RRB- , expecting the tempo to be about 70 BPM -LRB- Beats-per-minute -RRB- .
He returned to the bus a couple of days later , and Mike had put together the beat at 135 BPM - almost twice as fast .
After careful deliberation , Brad and Mike decided the faster beat was more fun .
The video was shot in Los Angeles where members of the fan club LP Underground participated in the shoot .
The band was touring during the video and had a different director from the usual Mr. Hahn .
For most of the video , the angle was shot from behind the band creating a silhouette type image .
The strings on the track were recorded live and arranged by Mike Shinoda and Dave Campbell .
-LRB- thanks , Nick - Paramus , NJ -RRB- The song is about being ignored by everyone and making yourself heard .
This was the second single from the album , after `` Somewhere I Belong . ''
-LRB- thanks , William - Indiana , IN , for all above -RRB- Mike Shinoda on shoutweb.com : '' ` Faint ' was just a working title that we wanted to keep .
I do n't know what the actual title would have been but it was n't that .
That word does n't even appear in the song . ''
