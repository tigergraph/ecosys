This is a track from Last Days at the Lodge , the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Amos Lee .
He explained the song 's meaning in an interview with The Boot : `` It 's a song of reconciliation .
Taking the situation , being removed from the hurt for a little while , you get so much clarity .
I think most of the time when people have big disagreements and big misunderstandings , when time lessens that blow it creates a deeper understanding for both people .
You 've hollowed out a lot of the brick that was between you and there 's light that shines into the situation .
It 's a song of reconciliation first and foremost .
Coming to the realization that people make mistakes and no one is perfect . ''
Lee discussed his songwriting process with The Boot : `` I 'm inspired by the situation .
Songwriting is n't always something that 's directly proportionate to the experience .
I hope that they 're -LSB- the songs -RSB- open enough that people can understand and feel whatever it is that they want to feel .
That 's the beauty of music , that it 's abstract in that way .
It 's not always super literal . ''
