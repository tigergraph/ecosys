'' -LRB- Love Is -RRB- Thicker Than Water '' was the second of three # 1 hits for not-quite-Bee-Gee Andy Gibb in his solo career .
It followed `` I Just Want To Be Your Everything '' and preceded `` Shadow Dancing . ''
But that 's just # 1 hits by Andy Gibb ; in the general scheme of things , this song bumped the Bee Gees ' `` Stayin ' Alive '' from # 1 and was itself bumped by the Bee Gee 's `` Night Fever .
`` Is that not enough Gibbs for you in the # 1 spot ?
`` Night Fever '' was seceded by `` If I Ca n't Have You '' - which also happened to be written and produced by the Gibb brothers .
Basically anybody who remembers 1977 will tell you that the whole year was one big blur of Gibb , and then at the end there there was Star Wars and somebody lit up Debby Boone 's life .
Collectors take note : Andy 's solo albums tend not to be released on their own as much as get included in Bee Gees ' boxed sets ; such is the case for most of the tracks from Flowing Rivers , available in the Bee Gees ' 4-disc set Mythology .
Barry Gibb had a hand in writing this song for Andy , which makes Barry Gibb the only person in music history so far to have written four consecutive # 1 Billboard hits in a row .
Eat your heart out , Elvis !
And now , if you 're tired of all this Bee-Gee worship , here is a specter at the banquet in Ken Emerson 's essay Britain : The Second Wave as printed in The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll : `` The Bee Gees ' ornate orchestrations and tremulous romanticism scarcely concealed a solipsistic nightmare ... in which the obsessed singer -LRB- most often Robin Gibb with his choked , inconsolable quaver -RRB- floated or flew in frightening isolation as everything dissolved into tears or rain .
The violins and silken harp sugarcoated a bitter pill , and the Bee Gees laced their confections with musical dissonances . ''
Hey , just so you know , it was n't just rainbows and unicorns back there .
