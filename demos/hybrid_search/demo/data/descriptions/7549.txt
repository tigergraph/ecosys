This ode to the Emerald City was originally included on One-man emo electro act Owl City 's first release , Of June , which he uploaded onto MySpace .
Young grew up in Minnesota , and when he wrote the song , he had never been to Seattle .
The song finds him imagining what it would be like there.In 2012 , after Young had a chance to visit Seattle , we asked him if it lived up to expectations .
His reply : `` It really was n't anything like the place in my head , it was just different .
It totally was n't better or worse , it was just way different .
The gum wall and the coffee were just a bonus . ''
This was one of the first songs that Young ever wrote .
He recalled to The Sunday Times February 14 , 2010 : `` I tried to join bands at school , but we never got on .
Then I discovered how much more I could do on my own with a computer .
One night , when I could n't sleep , an idea for an electronic track came to me .
That was ` Hello Seattle ' , which is on the album and is still most representative of the type of music I want to make .
It 's innocent , accessible pop , but with a melancholy feel and abstract lyrics . ''
Young said to The Star Tribune : `` Having never really traveled , the unknown was a pretty big inspiration to me . ''
