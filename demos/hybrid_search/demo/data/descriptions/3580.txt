Frontman Jim James explained the title `` Evil Urges '' to AOL : `` It 's kind of all tied into religion confusing people 's morality and people always wanting to think that something is either bad or good , whereas in reality I feel that most stuff is more confusing than that .
So basically , it 's about being confused and feeling that most people are searching for some kind of answer that sometimes people think religion can bring .
And lots of times , people will do things that they think are good in the name of religion , but oftentimes they 're destructive for the world , although people think they 're really being good - or maybe they are being good , 'cause I 'm kind of confused about the whole thing . ''
James told Mojo magazine May 2008 that the album title was one of many on a sheet of paper , but was `` winking its eye at me .
Some people were concerned because they thought Evil Urges sounded like a death metal record .
Once people hear it they 'll realize it 's kinda the opposite . ''
