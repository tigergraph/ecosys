This dance pop number was the twenty-fifth single to be released by British girl group Sugababes .
Promotional copies of the single came packaged as giant condoms to tie in with the song 's let 's - get-physical message lyrical content .
Sugababe Heidi Range said to The Guardian July 24 , 2009 : '' -LSB- The record company -RSB- came up with the condom idea , and we said yeah , it 's funny .
But we would n't sell -LSB- the condom packaging -RSB- to our younger fans .
I do n't think it 's appropriate . ''
This was the last Sugababes song to feature founding member Keisha Buchanan .
She was ousted shortly after and replaced by Jade Ewen for follow-up single `` About A Girl . ''
The song incorporates the chorus of Right Said Fred 's early 1990s hit `` I 'm Too Sexy . ''
California-based duo The Smeezingtons , aka Phillip Lawrence and Bruno Mars , produced the song .
They have also worked on X Factor winner , Alexandra Burke 's debut album .
Keisha Buchanan admitted in a 2013 interview that this is her least favourite Sugababes track . ''
` Get Sexy ' should n't have happened , '' she told Official Charts : `` It was amazing working with Bruno -LRB- Mars -RRB- , and we 'd love to work with him in this line-up , but ... I just did n't feel like that was a representation of who we were as a band but we did n't , at that point , have a lot of say . ''
