Paul Stanley : '' ' I Stole Your Love ' came quickly .
It was kind of a sister song to ` Love Gun , ' so it came around the same time .
Again , swagger and attitude .
That song was influenced in some ways by the Deep Purple song ` Burn . '
There 's an old standard called ` Fascinating Rhythm ' which is what ` Burn ' is based on .
The songs I was writing at the time were of a certain type .
I was trying to get closer to the things I liked in British bands that were my influences .
And then , interestingly , once you had KISS play it , the song took off in a different direction because of the perspective of the players in KISS .
So , if I had done those songs a hundred percent my way , they would have sounded more similar to those influences .
That 's the beauty of being in a band , each person brings their own perspective and takes it some place you might not . ''
