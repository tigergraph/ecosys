This is the title track of Stereophonics eighth long player , which is a part-concept album for which frontman Kelly Jones penned an accompanying movie script .
`` For a long time , everybody was a bit confused about what I was doing , '' Jones explained to The Daily Telegraph .
`` It 's not a concept album , it 's not a musical but in my head it all joins together .
It 's like Stand By Me crossed with Quadrophenia , the music bouncing into the story and the story bouncing into the music . ''
The album 's artwork was taken from an oil painting by Stephen Goddard .
Jones explained to The Sun : `` I bought a painting a couple of years ago by a guy called Steve Goddard .
It 's a bit dark , a bit weird - almost childlike .
A friend of mine knew him and he started coming to a few shows .
I played him some of the stuff , gave him the film script and he said he wanted to do the sleeve . ''
The album 's concept came to Jones when he kept hearing youngsters on the roof of a building next to his house .
`` I thought they were trying to break in , and I 've got kids at home , so I was freaking out a bit , '' he told The Daily Telegraph .
`` One night I shouted out the window , ` what 's going on ? '
It turned out they were trying to get to the railway behind our house and paint the train .
`` That stuck in my head ; they were going to risk all that to go and spray graffiti , '' he continued .
`` All these scenarios were unfolding .
What if they were spraying a love message to a girl who catches the train every morning ?
So there was a story evolving , and music evolving , and things would bleed from one into the other . ''
