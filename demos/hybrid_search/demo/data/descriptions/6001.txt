This seven-minute , free-form piece of music is the closing track from American rock band Thursday 's sixth studio album , No Devolución .
Frontman Geoff Rickly told Noisecreep about the improvised song 's origins : `` I would walk in on -LSB- guitarist -RSB- Tom and -LSB- drummer -RSB- Tucker messing around with the first guitar line as they warmed up before recording , '' he said .
`` I would always convince them to keep playing around with it once the rest of the band came in .
Every day , we 'd write a new song around that guitar part before we would get down to the real business of recording .
-LSB- Producer -RSB- Dave Fridmann caught on , and started recording the daily warm up .
Some days it would be 10 minutes , others five , once even 20 minutes .
The one that 's on the record is our favorite live version , with vocals added later . ''
Lyrically , the song sees Rickly observing an up-and-coming band making some of the same mistakes the singer did earlier in life . ''
` Stay True ' was about wishing I could talk to my younger self , and in particular what made me think about that was a band called Touché Amoré , '' Rickley explained to Rock Sound magazine .
`` They are a great young hardcore band , I put out their record -LSB- Rickly runs Collect Records , a vinyl only label -RSB- and those kids remind me of us when we started out playing basements .
In thinking about what I wish for them , their band and all the mistakes I hope they do n't make I recalled all the mistakes I had made . ''
