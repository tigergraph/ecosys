Aplin penned this song with her usual songwriting partner , former Rooster frontman Nick Atkinson .
She told The Student Pocket Guide : '' We meet up in his bar and play songs sometimes !
` Ready to Question ' I wrote recently and I guess it 's about religion , how it works and why people believe in certain things .
We were having a hung-over chat and decided to write about it ! ''
