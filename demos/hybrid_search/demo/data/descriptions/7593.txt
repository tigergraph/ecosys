This is based on Led Zeppelin 's 1975 song `` Kashmir . ''
It uses the same music , with P. Diddy rapping over it .
He was known as Puff Daddy at the time .
This was used on the soundtrack to the 1998 movie Godzilla .
Jimmy Page , the former guitar player for Led Zeppelin , performed this with P. Diddy on a 1998 episode of Saturday Night Live .
When this was re-released on Platinum Collection : Greatest Hits , P. Diddy 's obscenities were `` censored '' with Godzilla 's roar .
