The first single from Easton Corbin 's second album leans heavily on the same easy Texas swing that brought the Country artist success on his debut release .
Lyrically , it finds the narrator disputing the assertion of his girlfriend 's cousin that real love needs to involve drama .
Instead , he says love can simply be just having a good time together and having fun .
Speaking to CMT News , Corbin credited producer Carson Chamberlain with making the song work for him .
`` Carson 's a great person to keep it in the middle of the road , '' he said .
`` He keeps it country with his style of production .
He just knows traditional country music . ''
Regarding the album title , Corbin explained : `` All Over The Road is a fun title , but it 's also actually what we 're doing out there .
We 're all over the road trying to get music out to everybody , so I just thought it made sense . ''
The song was written by Jim Beavers -LRB- Tim McGraw 's `` Felt Good On My Lips , '' Toby Keith 's `` Red Solo Cup '' -RRB- and Bob DiPiero -LRB- Montgomery Gentry 's `` If You Ever Stop Loving Me , '' Brooks & Dunn 's `` You Ca n't Take The Honky Tonk Out of the Girl '' -RRB- .
It features production from Carson Chamberlain , who also manned the controls on Corbin 's debut album .
The song 's music video was directed by Shaun Silva and filmed in Austin , Texas during the South By Southwest music conference .
`` This video was about just having fun with your girl , and that 's exactly what we did , '' Corbin explained to CMT News .
`` The weather and the surroundings , just the whole thing was set up perfect for that . ''
