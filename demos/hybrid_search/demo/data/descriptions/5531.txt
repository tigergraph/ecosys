This song was inspired by a random trip John McCrea took on a New York City subway .
`` Generally , I do n't tell people stories behind songs but I will say that it was just an observational thing , '' the Cake frontman told Spinner .
`` I was on a subway in New York .
I saw this guy and was imagining things about him and started writing things down . ''
