In The Daily Mail , April 27 , 2007 , Natasha Bedingfield said : `` The key to understanding the song is not the line ' I wan na have your babies , ' it is where I go ` mmm , mmm , mmm , mmm ' and then sing ` Can I button my lip so the truth does n't slip ? ' ''
Bedingfield goes on to say that the song is about the dangers of concealed emotions spilling out too early in a relationship : `` That 's something that girls are more prone to than guys .
How many women do you know who will tell their friends that ` he 's the one ' after just a couple of dates ?
Too many properly . ''
Bedingfield -LRB- from Observer Music Monthly , February 2007 -RRB- : `` It 's just a cheeky song .
About how us girls ca n't keep our plans to ourselves and we sometimes scare guys off .
Most girls , if they really like someone , they 'll put his surname after her name or think about what their kids would like .
It 's a secret look into what girls really think . ''
