This song popularized the phrase `` A little Sumthin ' Sumthin ' , '' which is a very utilitarian saying asking for whatever you have that 's good .
In the hands of Maxwell , the song is a sensual request to lady , asking to get to know her better , and probably a lot more .
The song helped him earn a reputation for smooth baby-making music , and it became one of his best known songs .
A track from Maxwell 's first album , he wrote it with Leon Ware , who wrote many of the songs on Marvin Gaye 's I Want You album .
On his VH1 Storytellers appearance , Maxwell said that when he signed with Columbia Records , his first request was to work with Ware , who the label connected him with .
The pair holed up in a small room and put the song together .
