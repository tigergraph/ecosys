Good Luck Charlie and Lemonade Mouth actress Bridgit Mendler has been writing songs since she was six years old and her credits as a songwriter include `` This Is My Paradise , '' which she wrote and performed for the 2010 movie Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 .
The following year , she co-wrote and sang the Disney 's Friends for Change Games anthem , `` We Can Change the World '' .
This is the first song from Mendler 's debut album , Hello My Name Is , which she penned with Emanuel `` Eman '' Kiriakou -LRB- Selena Gomez & The Scene 's `` Who Says '' -RRB- and Evan `` Kidd '' Bogart -LRB- Jason DeRulo 's `` It Girl '' -RRB- .
The song features an interpolation of Fugees ' 1996 UK # 1 hit , `` Ready Or Not . ''
Bridgit explained the song 's meaning in an interview with Kidzworld : `` It 's a fun song about a girl who is feeling like she has been the wallflower her whole life and she wants to go out there and take charge .
It has the romantic element of her going for the guy rather than waiting for the world to come to her . ''
