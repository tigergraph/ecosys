In this song about regret over a fading romance , the narrator watches airplanes take off , trying to figure out which one his former lover might be on .
Allan told Country Weekly magazine that he was close to calling the album Doing The Math : `` That 's always a weird thing for me .
I always want to call it something that has nothing to do with anything .
I almost called it ` Doing the Math , ' from that ` Watching Airplanes ' song -LSB- Checkin ' my watch , doing the math in my head/Counting backwards to when you said goodbye -RSB- .
I felt like Living Hard was the coolest looking on the shelf .
That 's where we 're at right now .
Everything 's a little out of control right now .
It 's real heavy out there right now . ''
