Despite the song 's references to drugs and strippers , Aldean told Billboard magazine that listeners should n't pass judgment on its risqu√© content .
`` I hope people actually listen to the song , listen to the lyrics , listen to what the song 's saying , '' he said .
`` If they think , ` that song 's about a stripper , I ca n't listen to this , ' they 're going to completely miss the idea of what the song 's about .
Honestly , I think it 's one of the most well-written songs on the record .
Like ` Dirt Road Anthem ' and songs like that , it allows us to branch off in a different direction and try something new . ''
Nashville singer-songwriter Cannan Smith and Tyler Hubbard of Florida-Georgia Line penned the song , which was originally included on FGL 's independently produced EP , 2010 's Anything Like Me .
According to Hubbard , Aldean found the song online himself , and he called his producer Michael Knox the same night wanting to cut it.When we spoke with Hubbard at the 2013 ACM Awards , he explained : `` That was just one of those songs where you try to put yourself in somebody else 's shoes and write from their perspective .
It worked out nicely for us .
That 's been a song that we loved for a log time , and it 's really cool that Aldean cut it and it did well for him so it 's an honor , man . ''
