Co-producer Mark Neill told the story of the song in a track by track on The Black Keys Fan Lounge : `` This is born out of a crazy idea about a harpsichord .
In the Spring of last year -LRB- 2009 -RRB- we were talking about the instruments we were going to bring to the recording .
I said I 'd bring all this stuff , and I 've got some magic tambourines , but I told him -LRB- vocalist/guitarist Dan Auerbach -RRB- ` Look , tell the Management I want a harpsichord down there . '
And there was silence on the phone for a minute and then he goes , ` Cool ! '
-LSB- laughs -RSB- .
Much to my surprise , after much double-checking and goading , finally it did show up mid-way through the session from Nashville .
Immediately I just turned the lights down in the studio and shoo'ed everybody out .
Dan sat down , we talked a little bit , and then I shut up and he just started writing that song .
Beautiful .
It 's not a ballad , it 's , I dunno , it 's soul music !
It 's beautiful . ''
