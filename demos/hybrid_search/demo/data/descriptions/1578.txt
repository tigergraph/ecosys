This is the lead single from Irish pop group Westlife 's second compilation album , The Greatest Hits .
It is one of four new tracks on the standard edition , the others being `` Beautiful World , '' `` Wide Open '' and `` Last Mile Of The Way . ''
The song was released on November 14 , 2011 .
The song was written by Gary Barlow of the rival vocal pop group , Take That , and American Producer John Shanks , who helmed Westlife 's 2010 album , Gravity .
Group member Nicky Byrne said the group was excited to have worked with the two songsmiths .
`` They wrote ` Patience ' for Take That so we 're confident we have a great team behind our new song '' , he said .
`` Some people might think Gary would be seen as the competition but we do n't at all .
It 's kind of cool he 's written for us . ''
