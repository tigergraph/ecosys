Vocalist Andy Six told the story behind this song in an interview with Kerrang !
: `` Lyrically I had pretty much the whole song mapped out in my head for a long time .
Some of the kids we hear from are really going through some stuff , they ; they write to us on the internet and tell us about the difficult things they have to face in life .
We want to give a positive message to our audience , though we do n't always know how to help in that regard , but we promise that we will always try and if nothing else we can lend our music as a helping hand . ''
