Verve vocalist Richard Ashcroft teamed up with the American film score composer Thomas Newman to pen this song for the opening credits of the 2011 movie , The Adjustment Bureau .
Newman has penned the soundtrack for over 50 movies including Shawshank Redemption , Finding Nemo and American Beauty .
He is a member of a Hollywood film-scoring dynasty that includes his father Alfred Newman , his uncle Lionel Newman , his brother David Newman , and his cousins Joey Newman and Randy Newman .
Another Richard Ashcroft song - `` Are You Ready ? ''
- is featured over the closing credits of The Adjustment Bureau .
This one can be found on the debut album by RPA and the United Nations of Sound , an alternative rock band formed by Ashcroft .
Ashcroft recalled to Billboard magazine the writing of this song : `` Tom came over to London , and it was bizarre .
I could 've had a guitar and he could 've played piano , but he ended up on a Wurlitzer and I was playing a vocoder - two keyboards writing a tune in different rooms .
It was interesting . ''
