This track , written by Steve about his ex-wife , captures the veteran bluesman and former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones casually playing guitar and mandolin together on a couch .
Jones also plays lap ukulele and fretless gourd banjo .
`` It 's real primitive , '' Steve told Mojo .
`` John plays that thing right down in the Mississippi mud .
I sat there with my mouth open . ''
