Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones wrote this song , which is about an unfaithful girl who will pay the price for her deceitful ways .
The lyrics reflect Jimmy Page 's views on women at the time .
He thought they were deceitful and inferior to men , similar to Aleister Crowley , who Page idolized .
-LRB- thanks , Adrian - Gettysburg , PA -RRB- All four members of the band sing together on the chorus .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB- Jimmy Page performed this while touring with the Black Crowes in 1999-2000 .
Page played a Fender 10-string steel guitar on this , and Jones played a church-style organ , using a pedal to generate the bass .
Page told Guitar Player magazine : `` I had never played steel before , but I just picked it up .
It sounds like a slide or something .
It 's more out of tune on the first album because I had n't got a kit to put it together . ''
Led Zeppelin performed this on their Scandinavian tour in 1968 , then never played it live again .
British singer Sandie Shaw became the first artist to cover a Led Zep tune when she reworked this for her 1969 album , Reviewing the Situation .
