This celebration of different cultures features Bob Marley 's oldest son , Ziggy Marley .
This was Summer 's first album of original material since 1991 's Mistaken Identity and her highest charting album since She Works Hard For The Money in 1983 .
It was recorded over a space of three years , so the Queen of Disco did indeed work hard for her money .
In a press release Summer described the background of the title Crayons and the aesthetic of the album as `` a menagerie of colors and styles , with hints of different ethnic traditions and sounds .
My dream is that when people hear the music it will remind them of their youth , their childhood and the joy and wonderment they felt exploring their first pack of Crayons . ''
