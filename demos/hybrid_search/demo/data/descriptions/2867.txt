Milo Cordell of Big Pink described this to Spin magazine as , `` kind of like a desperate love song . ''
The drum break is by the record 's producer Paul Wentworth , who is a member of Nottingham-based five piece The Amber Herd .
The lyric , `` I will be loved or die trying '' is a nod to the title of 50 Cent 's debut album , Get Rich or Die Trying .
