This Jason Sellers , Paul Jenkins , and Michael Dulaney penned contemplative ballad finds Aldean singing about missing home .
`` That song is about Macon , Georgia , to me , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` It 's about me growing up in that town and wanting to get out and pursue this dream of being a singer , spending so much time working on that , and trying to get outtta there and be successful in the music business .
Once that started to happen , all I wan na do is go back and hang out there now .
That 's kinda how it is for me .
There 's certain things I see on the way home that remind me , ` I 'm back in my spot .
Whether it 's a street sign , a store , whatever it is , when I see it , it 's , ` I 'm back , I 'm back to my place , where I 'm comfortable . '
It 's home . ''
One of the threads running through the Night Train album is a feeling of nostalgia , which Aldean told The Boot was n't something that he initially set out to do .
`` I do n't think it 's something I deliberately look at , '' he said .
`` I think it 's me just kind of being the age that I am .
I think a lot of people my age , when you get around friends or whatever , I ca n't think of one time that I 'm hanging out with my friends and we do n't start about high school and being teenagers , and stuff you did back in those days .
Not that I 'm old .
I think when you 're mid-thirties , 40 , I think that 's kind of just what you do .
So , of course I 'm going to be drawn to songs like that .
I think that 's why you see some of that nostalgic feel scattered throughout that record . ''
Scotty McCreery recorded a similarly titled track for his debut album , which has nearly the same theme .
