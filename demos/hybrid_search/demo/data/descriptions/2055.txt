On a July 16 , 2006 blog for the Australian newspaper The Herald Sun , Billy Joel said that the music for this song was inspired by the songs of Leiber and Stoller , which were recorded by Ben E. King and The Drifters .
He added that the words came from personal experience .
The whole An Innocent Man album was done in the style of 1950s and '60s popular music .
It was Joel 's homage to the '60s - era R&B that he grew up on as well as his own romantic experiences as a teenager .
Joel said in 1000 UK # 1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh , `` Usually I agonize over every note , but this time the songs came pouring out of me . ''
