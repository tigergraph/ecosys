This tune about pursuing a lady is a promotional single from American rapper Flo Rida 's third studio album , Only One Flo -LRB- Part 1 -RRB- .
The chorus samples 2Pac 's 1997 single `` Hail Mary '' from The Don Killuminati : The 7 Day Theory , which goes , `` Come with me , Hail Mary / Run quick see , what do we have here / Now , do you wan na ride or die / La dadada , la la la la. `` Flo Rida told MTV News : `` That 's a record that 's on the romantic side , for the ladies .
It 's crazy to look at the credits and everything and have Tupac as one of the writers -LSB- on the album -RSB- .
I 'm a big fan of his and I was trying to take it up to the next level with this album . ''
