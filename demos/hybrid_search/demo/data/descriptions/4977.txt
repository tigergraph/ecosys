This tale of a rekindled relationship is the first single from Norwegian indie folk rock duo Kings of Convenience 's third studio album , Declaration of Dependence .
Eirik Glambek BÃ¸e of the duo said that the lyric was inspired by their German viola player , Toby .
He explained : `` He and -LRB- K of C partner -RRB- Erlend were reading an article about someone crossing the Atlantic on a surfboard , when Toby said -- in English -- they 're must have been a boat behind .
It was a great image .
We think this song belongs to our grandparents , but we ca n't work out which decade we 've been inspired by . ''
This song , which is accented by strings and upright bass , was premiered in the southern Italian town of Bari where the duo played a venue that is normally a boxing ring .
