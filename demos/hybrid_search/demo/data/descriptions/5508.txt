Carly opens her second studio album with an interpolation of Sam Cooke 's `` Cupid '' before bounding into an up-tempo love song that sees her singing of being struck by Cupid 's `` tiny little bow . ''
Carly penned the tune with her guitarist Tavish Crowe , and Dallas Austin , who has written hits for TLC , Gwen Stefani and Madonna .
