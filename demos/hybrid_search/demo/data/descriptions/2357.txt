This song is about a girl Blunt dated , but he wrote it years after the relationship ended .
When he appeared on the UK show Songbook , Blunt explained : `` I guess it 's a realization that you 'll never be with someone , but the frustration that they are still alive and out there in the world .
It can be an incredibly painful idea - I sat with the song for quite a long time .
But for me , it 's probably my most personal song .
Whereas ` You 're Beautiful ' is about a moment , one second in time of passing that person , the song ` Goodbye My Lover ' is about a lifetime 's worth of emotion , the fact that that relationship is over , and that life continues .
And yeah , it 's the most personal song on Back To Bedlam . ''
If you think the person Blunt is singing about in this song is dead , you 're not the only one ; Blunt says he gets asked that a lot .
He says the girl he 's singing about is very much alive , but the grieving in the song gives the impression of death .
A 2006 UK survey by The Bereavement Register revealed this to be the year 's most requested funeral song .
James Blunt lived with actress Carrie Fisher while he recorded Back To Bedlam .
He met her through a family friend .
In the Radio Times February 4th-10th 2006 , James Blunt described how he recorded this song in Carrie Fisher 's bathroom : `` For ` Goodbye My Lover , ' we needed a piano .
There was n't one in the home studio we recorded in but Carrie had one in her bathroom .
So I said , Let 's get the home studio and spend the night in there .
It was a good acoustic - that 's why people sing in the shower .
And it sounds great to me - that 's what 's on the album . ''
This was the fourth single from Back to Bedlam , and in the UK , it caused a bit of Blunt-fatigue .
In May , 2006 , the UK radio station Essex FM banned this and all of Blunt 's other songs because `` We appreciate his success but we need a break . ''
