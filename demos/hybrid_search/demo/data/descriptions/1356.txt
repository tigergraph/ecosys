This song is about going psychotically and critically insane .
Lead singer Jonathan Davis says the lyrics deal with `` when you 've reached your point and you 're like , ' I ca n't take this anymore , ' and you do something crazy . ''
Davis says that on the See You On The Other Side album , he was trying to present more universal thoughts instead of writing about his specific experiences .
