Sorry if we 're scaring you , but according to the Mayan calendar , the world is going to end on December 12 , 2012 .
This track from the deluxe version of American Tragedy was inspired by that dark prediction .
J-Dog of Hollywood Undead told the story behind the song to Artist Direct : `` We were sitting around one day actually talking about the end of the world because of all this s -- t that 's happening .
The chorus came out talking about 2012 and the end of the world , wondering if it 's real or not , and how everyone 's freaking out .
We were contemplating it all .
That 's how the chorus came about .
Then Johnny 3 Tears sat there with it and wrote his verses .
When we were touring with Avenged Sevenfold , we showed Synyster Gates that song , and he said , ` Holy s -- t , that 's the craziest verse I 've ever heard !
The lyrics are insane . '
It 's pretty heavy . ''
