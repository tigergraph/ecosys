Vocalist Max Bemis told Alternative Press : `` As the record goes on , I talk about my wife Sherri in the form of my anchor and our relationship as an anchor , but there are still issues in life .
I still have these outstanding issues in my life that I wanted to address - those that are still there after you solve the biggest issue in your life .
It just means it will be a little is easier to deal with the plethora of other issues .
One of them was recognizing that not everyone is like that in a relationship , and I was seeing this from a first-person perspective with someone who is a jerk and who looks at people as property .
Similar to what I was addressing in ` Less Cute , ' it 's an extension of how we 're raised to see people as someone to possess or own and bend them to your will .
I 've been in relationships where people treated me like that and have seen others in relationships that are like that , and I felt like it was worth addressing because being in a relationship with Sherri sort of opened my eyes to how bad it really is in the world where we feel the need to posses everything .
