Singer Joe Jonas told the Australian radio show The Hot Hits that the trio 's fans `` mean the world '' to them and this song `` is giving back to them . ''
He added : `` After two years of their loyalty and dedication we felt there was no more personal way to give back than to share our influences , from the Bee Gee 's to Neil Diamond . ''
The brothers told MTV News that they 're comfortable with fans dissecting their love lives while listening to the songs .
Nick added : `` I think even the songs that talk about previous relationships really are pointed towards the fans in the end .
They 're the best and they 're the reason we 're doing what we 're doing . ''
When fans first got to hear this song , the networks were buzzing about whether it addresses Joe Jonas ' relationship with Taylor Swift .
The line `` And all the tears on her guitar / I 'm not bitter , '' which name-checks Taylor 's song `` Teardrops On My Guitar '' appears to prove to many that it does .
Joe refused to confirm who the song is about to MTV News .
He said : `` We went through a lot in the past year and a half , all of us .
And you 're just going to have to get the record and figure it out for yourself . ''
Taylor Swift addressed her relationship with Joe on the song `` Forever & Always . . ''
