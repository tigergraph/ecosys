This song featuring English R&B chanteuse Estelle is the fourth single from R&B singer-songwriter Robin Thicke 's fourth studio album , Sex Therapy .
Thicke told MTV News that he had the American Boy singer in mind when he started working on the song .
`` She 's just an amazing talent , '' he said .
`` She 's a rapper .
She 's a singer .
She 's a writer .
So it was really meant to be , and when I had this record , I was thinking to myself -LSB- that -RSB- it was perfect -LSB- for Estelle -RSB- . ''
Thicke told MTV News that he wanted to keep the video 's vibe a little lighter than the song 's deep subject matter .
He explained : `` The song is about the roller coaster you go through in a single relationship , but in this video , we 're just talking about the roller coaster of romance .
We 're trying to throw a nice little house party that 's representative of the house parties that I have at my house , which is classy , sexy , wild , naughty all at the same time . ''
