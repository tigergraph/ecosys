This was the first track to be released from The Virgins ' second album , Strike Gently .
The record was recorded at the East Village Recording Center underneath the site of the former rock club Brownies in New York City .
`` East Villagers may remember that venue , '' singer Donald Cumming told Spinner .
`` It still has all the old band graffiti on the walls . ''
The LP was produced by Johnny T Yerington and Gus Oberg as The Unicorn Parade .
The track was temporarily available as a free download before the release of Strike Gently .
Cumming told Spinner : `` This song was a lot of fun to record .
It was really new when we took it into the studio and everyone kinda just went for it .
We got it in a couple of takes .
It 's cool to capture a live performance , especially of a new song , because you get a lot of little details and accidents that might not have made it onto a more polished track . ''
