This is the opening track from American Country music artist Chris Young 's third studio album , Neon .
In an interview with Reuters , he described it as a transitional song from the previous album .
He said : `` It is a sexy love song , and I just thought it was a cool way to start this record to let people know that even though there is some stuff that is different , we 're not going off in a completely new direction . ''
Chris Young wrote the tune with Rhett Akins and Ben Hayslip .
Speaking of the writing session that spawned the song at a media event , the singer said his co-writers deserve much of the credit for the song 's success .
`` I had no idea that day walking in ; I had nothing , '' Young admitted .
`` It was actually Ben 's idea .
He was like , ` What do you think of something like this ? '
I said , ' I do n't really have something like that for the record . '
I think we wrote it in about an hour and went to lunch .
It was a really simple day .
I found that the majority of the stuff I 'm putting on a record does n't take all day .
We all like the idea and we 've got the right melody for the idea .
-LSB- When -RSB- it 's all marrying correctly , it falls out pretty quick .
It might get stumped on a line here or there , really trying to hammer out what the best way is to say it , but most of the time that 's how it happens .
If we 've got the idea and everybody 's on the same track , it falls out pretty quick . ''
