In this song frontman Max Bemis sums up his spiritual beliefs .
He explained to Alternative Press : `` Basically , I wrote this song during a moment of clarity and I think it 's the most spiritual song I 've ever written .
It 's probably one of my favorite songs that I 've ever written .
It illuminates how I feel about the universe and spirituality , and the evolution of the soul and the collective evolution of everyone 's souls .
It is sort of a hymnal ; it addresses how I believe that everything in the universe and other universes and parallels and dimensions are all united .
It 's kind of like one giant organism that I worship , and I call it God , but someone might not necessarily refer to it that way .
But I tried to illuminate my religious and spiritual views and how they pertain to the overall record .
This song shows the shift I had gone through in becoming one with this thing again , after years of being completely cut-off and feeling less important than it .
True love is the best example of the presence of something bigger in this life , and I wanted to show specifically how I see the afterlife and God .
I wanted to show people who have an aversion to being spiritual or religious that it is n't simply a crazy notion , but involves science and logic and reason .
The way it 's explained in the song is that all of the physical things fade away ; there will still be spiritual matter that will continue to persist in a way we can not perceive it .
There are things in life we can not explain or I believe you ca n't explain with physics . ''
The song title is a play on words on the Hebrew word `` Amen , '' which since Biblical times has been used at the end of a prayer .
It translate as `` Let it be so '' or `` So or it should be . ''
