The idea for this song , about friends who grow up and go their separate ways , was Toby Keith 's , says co-writer Scotty Emerick .
The idea was hatched on an airplane , and the song was written in a Las Vegas hotel room .
The characters are all made-up people who Toby and Scotty created and gave lives to .
Scotty says , `` I have the FPL line in there - Florida Power and Light , '' and with a laugh , `` We got Waffle House Diner in there .
I really wanted that to be in there , that was funny . ''
Waffle House is a popular restaurant chain in the American south .

`` I had this idea for a long time , '' says Toby Keith .
`` Scott and I were talking one night and I said those words - ' I had a lot of nights I ca n't remember , but I was with friends I 'll never forget . '
So we were in Vegas for a few nights , working on some songs , and we turned it into a story song about a group of guys in a band who were closer than brothers .
It 's a good story song . ''
