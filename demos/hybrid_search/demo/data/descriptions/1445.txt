Bassist Flea spent a good deal of time during the writing of I 'm With You listening to classic Rolling Stones albums .
He told Rolling Stone that the strong interplay on I 'm With You of improvised jams , detailed guitar work and catchy hooks in songs such as this one compare to such Stones records as Exile On Main Street and Tattoo You .
`` It 's about a feeling and a song , '' he said of the connection .
`` About everyone embracing the moment of the song , not always about the riff . ''
