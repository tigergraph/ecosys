Speaking about the song , the band 's frontman Harry Koisser told NME that he woke up one day at drummer Dom Boyce 's house with this song in his head .
He added : `` We just got up and started recording it .
Originally I wanted it to have a really screechy harmonica sound over the beginning but we never got round to it . ''
The song 's visual was directed by RobRob and finds the band performing and smashing up a living room .
`` This is a video we 've both wanted to make since we were 15 , just when we were becoming deeply interested and growing a huge passion for music videos , '' said RobRob .
`` To us it 's a pretty classic set-up , a rock video with a band playing and smashing things in slow motion .
As soon as we heard the song we knew this would be perfect for it .
We wanted to create a little more anarchy though , so we incorporated this moving set idea . ''
