This tale of longing throughout the ages finds Kate hooking up with Elton John .
Speaking to Mojo magazine , Bush said the song was written for the legendary star and that she , `` did n't know what I would have done , '' had he not agreed to do it .
In 1991 , Bush 's cover of `` Rocket Man , '' which she recorded for an Elton John tribute album called Two Rooms , peaked at # 12 on the UK singles chart .
The song is about two lovers whose shared history runs from Roman times to the present day .
Bush told Mojo magazine : `` I supposed it was these lovers who keep meeting up over different lifetimes , but each time they meet , they get torn apart again .
I had an idea for that some time ago , but did n't start writing it until I came to this record .
It started with the idea of some sort of time traveling , but then it moved into what I felt was s more interesting idea : these souls that are meant to be together but then keep being pulled apart again . ''
