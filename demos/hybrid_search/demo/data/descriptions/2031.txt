As I Lay Dying open their sixth album , Awakened , with this lead single .
The song was released for free download on June 25 , 2012 and became available online for purchase the following day .
Vocalist Tim Lambesis told Artist Direct that Awakened found him penning more personal lyrics than on the band 's previous record , and this track `` may be the most introspective . ''
He explained : `` The first line of the lyrics is ` The truth of my heart is like a repressed a tale . '
What 's really going on in my mind and heart are things I struggle to grasp .
The process of writing the lyrics was very therapeutic .
I was realizing things in myself I wanted to change .
In other ways , I realized things I 've overcome positively .
Naturally , that has a certain darkness to it .
That 's not because I 'm a suppressed or dark person .
I think it 's because if anybody is really honest and they look at the deep issues in their hearts and the things they do n't typically talk about , there are going to be dark corners there .
The lyrics have a bit of a darker twist to them .
We 've always been known as a really positive band , but the positivity is addressing those issues head-on and the beauty that can come out of that . ''
Lead guitarist , Nick Hipa , told MusicRadar.com how he came up with the song 's riff : `` Riffs can be very funny things , the way they come about , '' he said .
`` There 's no real secret .
` Cauterize ' was a song that Josh -LRB- Gilbert , bass and clean vocals -RRB- brought in .
He 's really good at coming up with riffs .
I do n't think that he looks at the guitar in a technical sense ; he just looks at it in a writing sense .
He had a lot of the arrangement worked out .
What happens is , we all record individually and e-mail things to one another .
So when we get in a rehearsal room , there 's a lot of ideas going around . ''
