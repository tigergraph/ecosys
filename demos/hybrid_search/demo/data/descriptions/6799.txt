Newcastle-upon-Tyne bouncer Raoul Moat hit the headlines in 2010 when he went on the run after shooting three people .
Amongst his victims was police officer David Rathband , who was permanently blinded .
Frontman Jonathan Higgs told The Line Of Best Fit that this song is , `` a re-imagining of what he must have gone through . ''
He explained : `` I read this huge interview with him and he was saying how he could n't remember the faces of his family .
They were featureless as an orange to him .
And I thought that was so stunningly poignant .
It was poetic but at the same time incredibly un-poetic and devastating .
It was a terrible thing to have happened .
It just completely ruined his life .
Some of the lyrics are quotes from the interview .
He said he kept seeing the moment , seeing Raul Moat appearing in his mirror and that 's his last memory and he kept seeing it all the time . ''
The song title comes from the lyric `` let 's get up off the floor , and use our feet for hands , '' which guitarist Alex Robertshaw explained , `` is about trying to adjust to a sudden change , adapting .
`` Higgs added : `` I always throw some reference to evolution into pretty much everything . ''
