Frontman Charlie Fink 's lyrics for Last Night on Earth were heavily influenced by poetry .
Fink explained in a press release how this song was influenced by Frank O'Hara 's poem Having a Coke With You , which he read for the first time in 2010 : `` I wanted -LSB- ` Just Before We Met ' -RSB- to have a feel of that , or a tempo .
Just the notion of it .
Having a Coke With You is I think a very romantic poem , and that 's the only outwardly romantic song on the album , and so I wanted it to have the same approach . ''
