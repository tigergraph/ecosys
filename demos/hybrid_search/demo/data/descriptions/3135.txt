In a November 17 , 2005 Boulder Dirt article , Clyne explained that this song was about free thinking and expressing yourself , but is up to the listener to interpret .
Said Clyne : `` What we have is pieces of art .
We assign them some degree of message and humble meaning - at least in our own hearts - and we put it out there to the people .
And if they respond , then they pay for it with a dollar bill .
And if so , we 're lucky ; we 're not only artists , but we also get to make a living . ''
`` Counterclockwise , '' says singer/songwriter Roger Clyne in a podcast on DailyCamera.com , `` was meant to endorse free thinking .
I tried to use images , like lightening my load in some way .
For example , ' I bought a pancho and sandals , threw away my shoes ' - I 'm unclad , and trying to stand on the terra firma of the truth .
` Brought a toothbrush and a razor I probably wo n't use , ' those things are something that we use before we gather ourselves , and prim and proper ourselves up for social interaction .
` Hit the track , turned my back on the headline news ' - well , that 's a liberating thing .
Like , go on some grand adventure and turn your back on whatever huge societal expectations may be levied on you .
And then ` I 'm on my way to meet to the moon on the bay where she 's rising big and full and blue ' ; the moon is a wonderful symbol of awakening in the night , of glowing in the dark , so to speak .
So there , there 's my first verse of ` Counterclockwise . '
And it was meant to be something that would endorse individuals becoming unbound and unwound , such that they can express themselves freely , and hopefully with dignity , tolerance , and passion that wo n't advocate a predatory lifestyle .
That 's what that one 's meant to do . ''
