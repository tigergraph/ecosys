This is one of three collaborations with former Zero 7 member Sia Furler for Bionic .
The Australian singer/songwriter told Spin magazine about working with Aguilera : `` She 's crazy dope amazing .
She 's a perfectionist and she totally scrambled my mind .
When we were doing the vocal production , every take was sick .
Then she 'd ask , ` What do you think of these five takes ? '
I 'd be like , ` Well , every single one of them is perfect and I have no idea what you 're talking about if you think one of them is not perfect . '
She 's a mad scientist of singing . ''
Aguilera said in a video interview that she reached out to Sia , `` who I was a big fan of working with because of her work with Zero 7 , which I 'm a huge fan of . ''
