This song from the second Murderdolls album , Women and Children Last , was written by their lead singer Wednesday 13 and multi-instrumentalist Joey Jordison .
Murderdolls released their first album in 2002 , and that experience led to this song .
In our interview with Wednesday 13 , he explained : `` It was about how I got a bad taste in my mouth from the business side when that first Murderdolls album ended .
I wrote it about the whole system and how it works in the music business , or it did at that time . ''
Wednesday started writing this song in 2003 .
Originally titled `` Brand New Hell , '' he planned to use it for his 2005 solo album .
When he played Jordison the demo , he was surprised when his bandmate liked the song and wanted to use it for Murderdolls .
This was the last single the Murderdolls released , and also the last video they made .
The video was prescient : it shows the band driving off a cliff .
`` Every time I see that it all makes sense , '' Wednesday 13 told us .
`` It 's not like a depressing song or anything , it 's one of my favorite songs I 've ever written .
But it 's just got a weird sentimental vibe to me now when I listen to it , because it 's almost like I wrote it and it was like I was predicting what was going to happen . ''
