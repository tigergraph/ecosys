This has been rumored to be about a drug deal , but in an interview with New Musical Express , Frank Black said the song was about hobos traveling by train and dying in a big earthquake in California .
He started writing it when he was about 15 and was inspired by small earthquakes experienced growing up in California .
With much more pop appeal than most Pixes efforts , this became their most popular song , getting lots of airplay on college radio stations .
The Pixies never seemed too concerned about popularity , however , and did n't bother promoting this as a hit single .
