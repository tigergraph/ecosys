Frontman Carl Barat told The Independent newspaper May 30 , 2008 about this autobiographical song concerning his upbringing : `` It 's difficult to talk about that .
I am a hippie 's son , and I suppose I should be grateful .
I would n't say it was a bohemian life .
It was just alternative .
Colorful .
But my dad lived on a council estate .
He worked in a factory .
`` The interviewer then suggested that this song suggests a dark , monstrous world that left Barat with violent urges .
He asked whether such feelings really were part of his childhood .
Barat replied `` I guess so .
But it does n't have a go at anyone .
It just takes my make-up apart .
You miss out on stability in the hippie world .
It has other benefits .
But that 's the downside .
Of course it 's vitriolic and spitting , but at the same time it 's full of love - like the chorus .
` Come fall into these arms , ' you know - have some safety , security , some love .
It 's quite a loving song .
Being autobiographical is new for me .
It was hard to sing , and hard to allow to come out .
It felt scary .
I spent ages trying to explain it to my parents .
They have n't heard it .
But they know I do n't mean any ill by it . ''
