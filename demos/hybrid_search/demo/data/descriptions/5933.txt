Wigmore closes herGravel & Wine album with this song , which she penned during a time of solitude up in the Blue Mountains of Australia .
She told Artist Direct : `` I wanted to write a sweet song .
I write so many songs that end badly or in mayhem .
They can be quite morbid .
I wanted to write this song to sing someone 's soul .
I like that idea .
When you see each other when the timing is right , until then , you 'll try to whistle them .
Having the album finish on a mellow note , It 's different for me .
It 's nice .
It leaves you something to think about . ''
