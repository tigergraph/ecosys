Oh No I Love You is the second solo album recorded by Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess .
It was self-releases via Burgess 's own label O Genesis on September 24 , 2012 .
Lambchop 's Kurt Wagner penned all the album 's lyrics .
For this song , he wrote about Burgess 's head space after he separated from his wife , left his Los Angeles home and moved to a north London warehouse .
`` In 2000 I was helping him load up his van after he 'd played a gig at Manchester university , '' Burgess explained to Mojo .
`` I said to him , Would n't it be great for us to write together ?
He said , ` OK I 'll do the words , you do the music . '
Then in April 2011 I went to visit him in Nashville and we actually got round to doing it .
The beauty of the record is in how he documented how I was feeling during this period of time . ''
Burgess described this song to Mojo as , `` like Psycho '' meets Disney .
He added : `` It 's a desert song , desolate and eerie , but it also has this great string arrangement by -LRB- the High Llamas ' -RRB- Sean O'Hagan .
He wrote it in his flat in Peckham .
It lends the song , a magical , fantasy element . ''
