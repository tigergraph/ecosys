Vocalist and primary lyricist Max Bemis explained this track to Alternative Press : `` This is both a song about being passionately in love with somebody and subverting social standards at the same time because your relationship is so truthful and pure and passionate on so many levels - whether it 's like love levels or sexual levels .
It 's like the very act of loving each other is a statement of defiance against society that does n't promote human relationships like that ; it wants us to sort of not give everything to someone else , whether it be friends or loved ones .
When you can find everything that you need in someone - someone like a true love and it 's a real thing - it 's really a punk rock thing .
That 's why this song exists .
It 's especially about -LSB- wife -RSB- Sherri and her being an individual , and that 's one of the reasons I ended up falling in love with her - she was already defying and fighting against the man on her own .
She 's really creative and not a conformist type of a girl .
She 's even less conformist than I am , and that 's what this song is about . ''
