The song is backed by a 12-strong string section heavy on violas .
It 's likely that Drake desired to evoke the English composer Frederick Delius with this piece .
Back in 1958 Robinson had a UK # 1 hit as the leader of Lord Rockingham 's XI with `` Hoots Mon. '' This song is primarily in a 5/4 timing with occasional shifts to 4/4 .
Drake 's Cambridge friend Robert Kirby , who did the string arranging for Five Leaves , was unable to work on this track and Scottish composer Harry Robinson had fill in .
Kirby explained to Mojo June 2009 : `` Dave Brubeck 's ` Take Five ' aside , that was the only time in my life I 'd heard a piece of music consistently in 5/4 .
I could not for the life of me work out how to write a piece of music that did n't stagger along like a spider missing a leg , how you crossed over and missed the bar lines .
But Harry 's string arrangement is scarcely in 5/4 - it goes along like a limpid river all the way , moving regularly and crossing over all the beats and the 5/4 with it . ''
The album title referred to the warning found towards the end of a packet of Rizla cigarette papers , that there were only five leaves left .
