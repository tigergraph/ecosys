Written by guitarist Tim Smith , `` Bored Teenagers '' was released as the B Side of `` Gary Gilmore 's Eyes '' , and also found its way onto a live compilation album The Roxy London WC2 -LRB- Jan-Apr 77 -RRB- .
A fair uptempo track , it is certainly in the spirit of the bored teenager , and not a bad complement for the rather more innovative A Side .
