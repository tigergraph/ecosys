Rufus Wainwright became a father in February 2011 when Lorca Cohen , daughter of Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard , gave birth to baby Viva Katherine Wainwright Cohen .
This song , which is addressed to little Viva , is about the home in the New York town of the same name where her daddy and her daddy 's partner live .
Wainwright explained to UK newspaper The Sun : `` It 's like what Krypton is to Superman .
Planet Montauk is where I go occasionally to reboot .
And I know touring will be difficult being away from her as this kid is really going be the captain of my ship for a long time .
She spends most of her time in LA or Paris and I miss her when we are apart .
And I do feel guilty about doing all of this and then having to go out on the road for two years right at this crucial time .
But to be fair , a child really focuses mostly on her mother at this stage and especially with having a daughter , I think she 'll cut me some slack . ''
