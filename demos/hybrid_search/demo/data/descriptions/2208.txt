This song finds frontman Win Butler singing , `` Never trust a millionaire quoting the sermon on the mount . ''
The line is a quote from Butler 's favorite author , 1984 novelist George Orwell , and is meant as a statement about conformity and hipster-political posturing in parts of London and New York .
He explained to The NME July 31 , 2010 : `` I do n't know if you 've ever been in Williamsburg or those parts of London where everyone is 30 years old , everyone has the same haircut and there 's no kids , no older adults , almost an oppressiveness at not having real human life on display in society .
On the one side you have a lot of pressure to be part of a commercial society , and everyone 's trying to sell you something all the time .
And then on the other side there 's this kind of hipness , and trying to find what 's cool , which has also a certain amount of emptiness associated with it .
I think it 's really difficult to try and navigate those two extremes .
`` Butler added that while some may think the line is about U2 frontman Bono , it 's not in a negative way .
He said , `` As much as people slag Bono , I will forever give him credit for engaging with George W. Bush when he was president .
Even though it was a deeply unpopular move , even in his own band .
The HIV medications in Africa , every aspect of the US foreign policy - it was a hell of a lot more than any president before had done . ''
