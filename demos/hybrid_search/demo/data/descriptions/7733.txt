Former rapper Aloe Blacc transformed himself into a retro-soul crooner and this feel good take on the Motown sound finds him singing about a summer 's day filled with nothing but `` Green Lights . ''
`` Sonically , it does n't sound like it sits in the same kitchen , '' Blacc told NPR of the difference between his Hip-Hop and Soul tunes .
`` But I think the ingredients may be the same , just making a different stew . ''
The song was released as Blacc 's second UK single , following the success of `` I Need A Dollar '' , on September 12 , 2011 .
