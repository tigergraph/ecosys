This is a track from the Austin , Texas folk rockers Okkervil River 's sixth album , I Am Very Far .
Frontman Will Sheff recalled the writing of the song to Spin magazine : `` I wrote this song on my grandparents piano , during some time I spent living with them in New Hampshire for the I Am Very Far writing sessions .
They were out visiting some friends , so I went into the living room of their huge empty old house and sat down at the piano they 've had for ages and which is probably the first musical instrument I ever played , way back when I was a little kid . ''
