This was the first single from the Nashville singer/songwriter Randy Montana , whose father Billy co-wrote the Garth Brooks hit `` More Than a Memory . ''
Randy wrote the song with Josh Ragsdale , who died of cancer the same month the album was released .
Josh came up with the title , and from there the song came fast .
`` That was one of those where we started at probably 11 o'clock and we were eating lunch by 1 .
It was crazy how fast we wrote it , '' said Randy .
A `` she done left me '' song , in our interview with Randy Montana , he explained : `` We just started going back and trying to paint that picture of all the things around the house that are still there .
Those are the only things that are left , the physical things , the objects are the only things that are left .
She 's gone . ''
