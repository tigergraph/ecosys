This mid-tempo rock ballad is a demo from the now-disbanded group Gone 'Til November .
Singer-songwriter Aim√®e Proal , who fronted Gone 'Til November , co-wrote the song with One Republic 's Ryan Tedder .
Tedder told Digital Spy that this song about a girl escaping from a lover with a self-destructive streak , features an experimental bridge inspired by Mozart .
