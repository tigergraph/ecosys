The origins of this cut lay in an old song written by vocalist Patrick Stump .
Bassist Pete Wentz then added lyrics about lost love and getting hurt .
He told Kerrang !
Magazine : `` Having time away from the band , this was one of maybe two songs where I decided to write about what was going on in my life .
But more in a ` what if ' ? '
way .
I could n't have written this after Folie a Deux . ''
Patrick Stump told Kerrang !
: `` The sound of the guitars are interesting .
There are a lot of things on there you might think are synthesisers that are n't .
They 're actually guitars , inverted in a way . ''
