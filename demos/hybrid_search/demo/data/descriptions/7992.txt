This song is a tongue-in-cheek look at an abusive relationship .
Billie Joe wrote it around an inside joke the band had with bassist Mike Dirnt after he was sent to the emergency room for injuries resulting from a pillow fight with his girlfriend at the time .
Around the time of Kerplunk !
they were at a friends house having a pillow fight when Mike ran around a corner and hit his head on a low ceiling beam .
He fell backwards and broke both of his elbows .
-LRB- thanks , MsZacEfron - Chicago , IL -RRB- The title itself is a further play on that inside joke .
Metallica had a song on their Kill 'Em All album titled '' -LRB- Anesthesia -RRB- Pulling Teeth . ''
Mike 's girlfriend who the song is loosely based on was named Anastasia , so they kept the `` Pulling Teeth '' from the Metallica track for the title .
Mike eventually married her in 1996 and had 1 child with her ; they have since divorced .
