This is a single and title track from Los Angeles born R&B singer-songwriter Miguel 's debut album .
The song was produced by Salam Remi and features Roc Nation rapper J Cole .
The singer told MTV News about the song 's music video : `` The video was really dope , '' said Miguel .
`` The director worked with me on the treatment .
It was really his concept on the treatment , but I sent him some references , and he did a really good job at putting it together and making sure it was smart , but it was n't too smart .
We wanted to have some nostalgic qualities , a hip-hop base , but still wanted to give it an edgy flair . ''
Miguel told MTV News how the collaboration with Cole came about : `` I did n't get to be in the studio with J. Cole .
I recorded the song , and Mark Pitts at Jive - who happens to be a part of J. Cole 's management as well - I remember the call .
It was 3 o'clock in the morning , and Mark called me like , ` Yo , it 's crazy !
I ` mma play it for Cole . '
He played it for him , and Cole said he liked it . ''
