The Edens Edge trio of Hannah Blaylock , Dean Berner and Cherrill Green all grew up in rural Arkansas before moving to Nashville in 2007 after meeting songwriter Kye Fleming .
While trying to get implemented in the music business , the threesome had to get whatever jobs they could to pay the bills .
Blaylock helped to write this song whilst in the middle of a nannying job .
She recalled : `` I was nannying for this family and I put the children down for a nap .
Dean happened to call me during that time telling me he was in a writing session with a few of our friends .
He said they had a great idea and needed my help .
They put me on speakerphone and told me to talk about all the people in my life that have molded me , nurtured me and helped me become the person I am today .
And if you know me -LRB- or you 'll quickly find out -RRB- I have no trouble talking , so they got an ear full !
They finally said they had what they needed and before I knew it this song was in our lives . ''
A horse that Blaylock rose in her childhood was one of the inspirations of this contemporary bluegrass tune .
She recalled : `` I grew up on a farm in a town of 50 people .
There were not a lot of kids for me to play with so some of my best friends were my animals .
One of my very best friends was a little Welch Pony named Cherry Pie .
She was in her mid-30s when I got her from my grandpa 's best friend down the dirt road and she passed away on our farm in her 50s .
She spent her entire life in Nimrod , Arkansas .
We rode everywhere together and ran as many speed competitions at our horse shows as we could .
These are the things in our lives that mold us more than we even realize .
I know all of you have one of those too .
A dog , a best friend down the street , a toy , a movie ... it could be anything .
Everyone has a ` Cherry Pie ' and it 's a very cool thing to look back and say thank you to the thing that defined our childhoods . ''
