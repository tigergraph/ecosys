This song tells the story about a woman who kills herself .
Her ghost comes back to the house where her husband still lives .
She starts closing and opening doors and windows : `` I hear a creaking through the door , I see you seeping through the floor . ''
She is trying to tell him that she is sorry .
He tells her that he wants to move on with his life : `` It 's not easy asking you to leave . ''
