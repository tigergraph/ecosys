This slice of acoustic melancholy was one of the first songs frontman Chris Cornell penned for King Animal .
He told Artist Direct : `` It was actually in a period of rehearsals before we were even sure we were going to write a new album .
I was doing rehearsals for Songbook .
I was sitting with an acoustic guitar and playing .
Every once in a while , I 'd be spacing out and playing something .
It 's cool I 'd record it on my laptop with the mic there .
Suddenly , and I do n't really know why , I started coming up with ideas I thought would make great Soundgarden songs .
That had n't happened in a long time .
I had n't really thought like that .
That was the only one of about four or five that I turned into a Soundgarden song .
It felt like something that would fit with us because you ca n't really nail it down in a sense .
Stylistically , it 's its own thing .
It 's also a new thing to me .
I do n't know that I 've really heard a song like that .
I can hear influences in it .
There 's something about the bass , the vocal delivery , and the melody that reminds me a little bit of The Beatles and Paul McCartney .
There are elements that just sound like Soundgarden to me though . ''
The lyrical concept came from a conversation Cornell had had many times with friends .
He explained : `` You 'll see a person in a situation and say , ` If somehow I manage to wander into that situation without understanding that I 'm doing it , make sure to let me know ' -LSB- Laughs -RSB- .
`` If ` Fell On Black Days ' was about waking up and realizing you 're in a dark period of your life , '' he continued ` Black Saturday ' is asking somebody to warn you if you do n't realize you 're heading in a direction where you might wake up one day and end up in a bad part of your life . ''
