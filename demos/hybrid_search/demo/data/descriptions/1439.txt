Vocalist Joe Goddard told Billboard magazine that this track was written immediately after seeing Susan Boyle 's famous performance of `` I Dreamed a Dream '' on Britain 's Got Talent .
`` I 'd never seen it before and I found it quite incredible , '' Goddard recalled .
`` Just listening to that made me want to write a song .
I sent the track to Alexis -LSB- Taylor -RSB- and he quickly wrote the words and sent it back . ''
