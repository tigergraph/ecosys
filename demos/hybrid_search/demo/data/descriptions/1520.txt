The opening track from Omaha , Nebraska reggae rockers 311 's 10th studio album , Universal Pulse is a direct thank you to their fans .
Vocalist Nick Hexum told Artist Direct : `` It says , ` Let me introduce you to the excitable crew . '
A long time ago , I had thrown out something like , ` This one is dedicated to the excitable ones . '
Some of our fans call themselves that . '
311 Nation ' is a bigger name for all of our fans , but a certain crew of hardcore fans is known as ` The Excitable Ones . '
The chorus opens with a shout to them because we realize they 've enabled us to do what we do , and it 's a thank you to them . ''
The album title comes from this song .
Said Hexum to Artist Direct : '' ` Universal heart pulse ' is the lyric S.A. says in ` Time Bomb . '
We 're all about unity and bringing people together through music .
When you hear a beat and people start moving , and they 're having a non-verbal communication , it 's almost like a spiritual experience when everyone 's grooving together .
Universal Pulse is like the pulse of energy running through everybody and the way people can become unified through music . ''
