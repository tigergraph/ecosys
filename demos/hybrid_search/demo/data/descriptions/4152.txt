This is one of two tracks on Red Light Fever that Queen axeman Brian May plays guitar on .
Hawkins told Musicradar.com that `` the main thing that stands out as a real Brian May production is the vocals . ''
He added : `` In the last choruses this big humungous Queen choir comes in .
It was amazing : I would send him the MP3s over to England - he was n't actually in the studio with me - and then I 'd get this like , ` OK , Brian 's sending his track today . '
And we 'd listen to it and it was like , ` Oh my God ! '
You 'd just kind of go , ` Whoa ! ' ''
