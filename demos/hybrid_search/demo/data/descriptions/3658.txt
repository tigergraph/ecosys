This is a track from the self-titled debut album of Rufus Wainwright .
In a 2010 interview with The Daily Telegraph , the Canadian-American singer-songwriter discussed his writing process .
Wainwright revealed that though he reads and writes music , he tends to transfer a tune in his head straight on to the keyboard , rather than onto a sheet of paper .
Said Wainwright : `` Then I go back with my assistant and work out the proper value of the notes and the time signatures .
` April Fools ' came to me when I was in the bath .
I stood up naked and sang it .
Songs come to me at odd times .
The only thing they have in common is that , when they do come , the moment has to be theatrical . ''
