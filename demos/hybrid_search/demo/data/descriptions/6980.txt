Kellie Pickler had a traumatic upbringing beginning with her mother abandoning her when she was two years old .
She was mostly raised by her grandparents as her father was in and out of jail .
This song , which Pickler penned with her songwriter husband , Kyle Jacobs , poignantly addresses the painful memories of her mother 's neglect .
`` With ` Mother 's Day , ' I think that 's really going to be an ' I Wonder , '' she explained .
`` That was my story from more of a younger perspective .
` Mother 's Day ' is the woman singing the song ... I think when people hear that song , that 's going to be when it clicks and people are going to go , ` Wow , she 's not the little girl on American Idol anymore .
She 's a woman now .
It has been a little tricky transitioning into the adult . ''
Pickler and Jacobs put as much as they could of the way she felt into the song .
She said : `` That was really therapeutic , and really amazing to get to write with him , especially when you hear the song , and you get to the second verse - that was so special to write with him . ''
Pickler originally wrote the tune just for herself .
`` When Kyle and I wrote that song we had no intention of playing it for anybody , '' she told Billboard magazine : `` I needed closure and I needed something to lift me out of a dark place .
We wrote that song for that reason .
It got heard through the grapevine and now it 's on the record . ''
Pickler came up with the idea for the song when she realized Mothers Day was a day that she had never been able to celebrate .
It came about before she and Jacobs were engaged .
They 'd spent the earlier part of the day together but after he 'd dropped her of home she found herself struggling .
Pickler recalled to The Boot : `` He pulled in his driveway , and I called him and said , ` Baby , can you come back over here ?
Today 's just really hard . '
He said , ` Yeah , are you OK ? '
I said , ` Yeah , I just feel like we could write a great song today .
I feel like today is the day we 're gon na write a song . '
`` So Jacobs came over with his guitar , and the pair `` went through all the feelings , all the emotions , all the thoughts that I have and go through on Mother 's Day , and why it 's so difficult for me . ''
She described it as , `` one of those things where it 's like a slap in your face . ''
Filming the song 's music video brought back painful memories for Pickler as she revisited some of her childhood moments .
`` Seeing my father struggle with his alcoholism and drug addiction ... He was always in trouble with the law .
Always , '' she recalled to The Boot .
`` So it was a battle to have to go and visit him in the penitentiary as a child , but that was so normal for me .
Looking at it now , as an adult , that 's not normal .
That 's not the way it 's supposed to be .
I got to hit a whole lot of places , a whole lot of my past in shooting this . ''
