Bundy wrote this with the Nashville songwriters Mike Shimshack and Jeff Cohen .
In our interview with Laura Bell Bundy , she explained : `` Mike and I got together and had some dinner , and he was telling me some stories about how he 'd said to a girl at the bar , ` My motto with these women is saying , I 'm no good for you , baby . '
And I said , ` That is so funny .
That 's our song tonight that we 're gon na write .
` It was a little different , it had a little bit of , -LRB- singing -RRB- ` very superstitious , ' it 's got a little bit of Stevie Wonder in there .
And it 's -LRB- singing -RRB- ' I do n't think you heard me correctly , I 'm no good for you , baby . '
So that 's what I picked out of it .
I was like , ` That kind of sounds like Stevie Wonder , but we ca n't really copy it .
So let 's bring the funk in . '
So Jeff started playing his guitar over this very loose track that Mike had done , and we started singing and throwing out ` I 'm No Good For You , Baby , ' and it was very '60s .
Then the black-grounds , or the black-ups -- does that sound horrible ?
-LRB- laughing -RRB- It 's all right , they call themselves that .
It 's just that when other people hear it , it does sound a little bit weird .
It 's like an inner band term .
So even if you 're black , it 's a black phrase . ''
This song followed `` Giddy On Up '' on the `` Shakin ' '' side of the Achin ' and Shakin ' album .
It 's a concept album devoted to the two sides of her personality , and `` I 'm No Good '' represents the phase after the breakup described in `` Giddy On Up . ''
