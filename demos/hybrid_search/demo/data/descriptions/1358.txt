Mark Feehily of Westlife explained in publicity materials that the song was produced by `` a friend of mine called Steve Anderson who was MD to a couple of Westlife tours . ''
He added that it was written by `` a friend of his called Simon Petty from America . ''
He continued : `` I really liked it and we just said for a laugh to put a vocal on it .
I just felt like I could definitely kind of give that a shot , you know , so I tried it and that was that and then a few weeks later he sent me the finished version and I was like ` Wow I like that ! ' .
And I met Kian on dinner when in London with Jodi and I played it to him and he liked it and then he sent it to someone I have n't even known and they liked it so basically everyone kinda was liking it .
I did n't expect anyone to think it was good for a Westlife album cause , you know , it is a bit different but at the same time , you know , why not ... It 's quite a sad silent song and it 's quite a soulful vocal and it 's quite heart-felt vocal , it 's a bit darker , it 's a bit more sort of , you know , deep down inside .
I think we 've all been through sort of periods of life when it 's dark .
The song and the lyrics kind of hit a nerve and hopefully that comes across in the vocals , you know . ''
