Cook wrote this song with hitmaker Claude Kelly -LRB- `` My Life Would Suck Without You , '' `` Party in the U.S.A. '' -RRB- .
The other co-writer was multi-platinum music producer Matt Squire , who previously helmed Cook 's cover of `` Do n't You -LRB- Forget About Me -RRB- . ''
Cook told Billboard magazine : `` I love the tongue-in-cheek aspect of that -LSB- this song -RSB- .
Love is obviously a four-letter word , but it 's also implying that love is a curse word .
It 's a jaded view on love , but it fit into the back-half of this record . ''
