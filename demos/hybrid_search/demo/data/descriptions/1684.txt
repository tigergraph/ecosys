Smokey Robinson co-wrote this song with his Miracles band mate Ronald White .
The song is about a shy girl who is afraid to approach the boy she loves until he `` beats her to the punch '' and comes to her first .
When she discovers her new boyfriend is a playboy , she decides to turn the tables on him : So I ai n't gon na wait around for you to put me downThis time I 'm gon na play my hunchAnd walk away this very dayI 'll beat you to the punch , yes I will .
