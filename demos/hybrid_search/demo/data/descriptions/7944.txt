Jedward were chosen to represent Ireland in the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest , after winning the national selection on The Late Late Show with this song .
A digital release of the single was made available the day after the show , and a physical release appeared on February 28 , 2011 .
Despite being the bookies ' joint second favourite to win the Eurovision song Contest , Jedward 's energetic performance of the song only earned 119 points putting them in eighth position .
The song was written for the duo by long-time Danish collaborators Lars Jensen and Martin Larsson , with the help of JLS lyricist Dan Priddy .
It is notable for being Jedward 's first original song , as their debut album consisted entirely of cover songs and medleys .
The duo explained on the Eurovision Facebook page : `` It was written by Deekay from Denmark and Dan Priddy from UK , but it was n't written specifically for Eurovision .
But when we heard it we knew it was perfect for Europe .
We hope its going to be a big club anthem . ''
