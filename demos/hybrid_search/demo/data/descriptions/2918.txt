This is the only original track off Christina Perri 's holiday EP , A Very Merry Perri Christmas .
The singer penned the song with her musician brother Nick Perri , the former lead guitarist of Shinedown .
She explained in a statement `` This EP is a collection of my all-time favourite Christmas songs , plus one original , ` Something About December ' which my brother and I wrote about finding Christmas wherever you are in the world , because it lives in your heart . ''
The lyric about `` mama 's whistling '' is a memory of one of the things Perri loves most about the holiday season .
`` She 's always whistling Christmas songs , '' the singer told CBS Local .
`` That 's the sound of my house . ''
Summer in Los Angeles is not conducive to getting into the holiday spirit , so while recording A Very Merry Perri Christmas , Christina Perri decided to help set the mood with a few festive knickknacks .
`` I have so much Christmas spirit all year round , so it 's fine for me , '' she told CBS Local .
`` But to get my band and my crew and the producers in the spirit we had a Christmas tree , lights and fake snow .
`` Not only that , Perri also forced everyone in the studio to wear Santa hats and she even bought a Santa Claus toilet for them to use !
Perri started writing this song while on tour in Singapore in mid April 2012 .
She was sitting alone in her hotel , missing her family and decided to cheer herself up by listening to some of her favorite Christmas tunes .
Inspired by the music making her feel back at home , Perri decided to write her own song about keeping Christmas in your heart all year round .
The `` Jar Of Hearts '' singer finished writing the tune with her brother 's help a few months later , and she twice broke into tears as the pair reminisced .
The song 's music video was shot in Los Angeles and directed by Elliot Sellers .
It sees Perri sharing some home videos from her childhood .
