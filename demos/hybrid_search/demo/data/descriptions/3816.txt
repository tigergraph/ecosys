Frontman James Skelly revealed to BBC 's Newsbeat program that the band worked with Irish musician and songwriter Sean O'Hagan on this track .
He said : `` We did some strings with Sean from the High Llamas who does Beach Boys type stuff and then went into the studio with Broudie . ''
The `` Broudie '' Skelly referred to is Ian Broudie , one time member of The Lightning Seeds and producer of three of the band 's albums .
