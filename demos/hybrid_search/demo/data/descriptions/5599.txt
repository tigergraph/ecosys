This Brett James , Troy Verges and Hillary Lindsey penned cut finds McBride singing about how she is blessed in many ways .
The song was released in October 2001 as the second single from her Greatest Hits album and it became McBride 's fifth Country # 1 single , topping the chart for one week .
The song was penned by the trio in Lindsay 's old apartment that she rented in Nashville .
Verges recalled to Roughstock : `` Brett and I had written ` Who I Am ' -LSB- for Jessica Andrews -RSB- , and that was the first song that really blew up for us .
It got so much attention .
It was like , ` What 's so different about this song ? '
It 's not a love song , so I was on this kick about writing songs that are n't just love songs .
`` There 's not that many of them , so people respond to them , '' Verges continued .
`` That was in my head for a while , and it still is .
If you can do that ... write a song that 's not a love song , it 's a way to stand out a little bit .
` Blessed ' is a love song , but it 's not a romantic love song .
Part of it is , but it 's about celebrating life . ''
