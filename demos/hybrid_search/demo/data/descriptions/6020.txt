This is the first single from Blood Like Lemonade , the seventh album by British electronica/soul group , Morcheeba .
The song finds singer Skye Edwards pondering the ecological state of the planet .
In 2003 Edwards was dismissed from Morcheeba , with both musical and personal differences being cited as the reason .
On February 12 2010 , the NME revealed that she was once again working with the band and this is the first single to be released since her return .
Multi-instrumentalist Ross Godfrey explained the song 's meaning : `` The lines about ` the hidden dangers ' and being ` cast adrift in space ' reflect worries about humanity .
That was inspired by reading interviews with astronauts -- they 'd get into space and look back at the world , and could n't understand why people were still fighting with each other , and why we were destroying our own planet , that was so beautiful from a distance .
The heavy breathing sound is an astronaut breathing in his helmet .
He does n't have long to live , and at the end his breathing stops .
He 's basically just trying to send a message that we should all get along . ''
