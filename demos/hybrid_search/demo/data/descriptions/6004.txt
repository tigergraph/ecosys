This song about a failed relationship was originally featured on the soundtrack for the 1996 movie Dead Man Walking .
It later was included on the limited edition three CD set Orphans : Brawlers , Bawlers & Bastards .
The song was covered by the Contemporary Alternative Country band The Steel Wheels for their 2013 No More Rain album .
Their lead vocalist and primary songwriter Trent Wagler told us : `` What initially attracted me to that song was the almost onomatopoeic way that Tom Waits uses words .
He 's almost Shakespearean in his writing : it 's sounds of language instead of even the words themselves .
If you study acting or Shakespeare , you 'll get that sense - you 'll see that he 'll use a number of hard syllables or hard consonants to mean there 's anger underneath it , and that 's how you get the sense for where it 's coming from .
The first line of that song was ` Dot King was whittled from the bone of Cain , ' there 's all this -LSB- makes onomatopoeic sounds -RSB- .
You know , it 's percussive in its language . ''
