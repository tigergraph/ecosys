This is one of a number of songs on Further Complications concerning thwarted lust .
Cocker admitted to Q magazine June 2009 : `` It 's something I struggle with .
I think a lot of men do .
It does n't go away .
There is a museum of palaeontoly at the Jardin des Plantes -LRB- in Paris -RRB- .
There is something very weird about standing there looking at these artifacts : ancient bones , the history from which we are all descended .
And then a pretty girl walks past and it 's like a call from the wild .
Someone did say that when your libido finally calms down it 's like being unchained from a gorilla . ''
Cocker elaborated on this song to the New Musical Express : `` Angela is the girlfriend of our keyboard player , Simon Stafford , but I did n't realize that at the time .
I was singing these words and I noticed that he was looking at me in a strange way .
He said , `` Why have you written a song about my girlfriend ? ''
I 'd forgotten that she was called Angela , so I think he thought I was trying to maybe move in on her .
I assured him it was a co-incidence . ''
