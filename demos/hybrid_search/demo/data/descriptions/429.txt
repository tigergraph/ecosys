Frontman Jonathan Davis can be heard using a violet ray at the beginning of this track .
The violet ray is an ancient medical device , which was used by quacks for electrotherapy treatment in the early 20th century .
Having got hold of electrical appliance , Davis cranked it all the way up and ended up shooting a two-inch spark off his arm , The whole painful procedure was recorded by producer Kill the Noise .
