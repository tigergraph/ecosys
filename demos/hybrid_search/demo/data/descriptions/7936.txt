The opening track to British alternative rock band Arctic Monkeys ' fourth album Suck It and See was penned by frontman Alex Turner in the New York apartment he shared at the time with his girlfriend .
He recalled to Q magazine : `` There was actually a storm going on and I was sitting in the flat in New York fooling around on me Red martin guitar .
It seemed quite a good description of a girl , she 's not even a thunderstorm , she 's more than one !
Plural . ''
Alex Turner told NME about this portrait of an unnamed muse : `` I remember writing this one when there was a storm going on .
They get like mad storms over there -LSB- in New York -RSB- , like , apocalyptic .
I 'm always trying to think of different interesting ways to like describe somebody but compliment them too .
So in that one , I like the idea that she 's not even a thunderstorm , she 's more than one .
I quite like the fact she 's plural .
` Thunderstorms ' meaning just , y' know , awesome ! ''
