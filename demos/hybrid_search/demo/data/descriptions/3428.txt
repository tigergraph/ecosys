Weller explained this psychedelic number : `` I 've never really done anything like it before .
It 's based on a poem I wrote about a year ago .
Lyrically , it 's about the sea as a metaphor for life .
Sometimes , however , you just have to plunge in and get on with it . ''
My Bloody Valentine 's guitarist Kevin Shields also plays on this track .
On this track Paul re-united with bass guitarist Bruce Foxton for the first time since The Jam split in 1982 .
Weller told Mojo magazine February 2010 : `` We 'd both lost loved ones and without getting too spiritual that was the spur of it .
I spoke to him this time last year when his wife Pat was ill and that broke the ice , then I invited him down to Black Barn -LRB- studio -RRB- .
There was no big plan , it was easy , a laugh , and nice to see him and work together again .
We just slipped back into it . ''
