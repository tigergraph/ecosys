In this song , Joel takes the persona of a guy who is told he is reckless .
Joel confirms the suspicion , admitting that he is crazy and extolling the virtues of a more carefree , but dangerous existence .
This was used as the theme song to the TV show Dave 's World , which ran from 1993-1997 on CBS .
Like Joel 's `` My Life , '' Billy did n't sing the version used on the show .
The version of `` You May Be Right '' on Dave 's World was sung by Southside Johnny .
This is the opening track to Billy Joel 's album Glass Houses .
Before the song starts , there is the sound of shattered glass , to match the cover picture of Joel throwing a rock into the window of an all-glass house , as a parody of the saying `` People who live in glass houses should n't throw stones . ''
This was Joel 's statement to his critics .
