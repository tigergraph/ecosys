This upbeat single from Zac Brown Band 's second major-label album , You Get What You Give , was written by frontman Zac Brown , his songwriting partner Wyatt Durrette and Texas born/Atlanta based Southern Soul Singer-Songwriter Nic Cowan .
It was released as the fourth single from the LP to country radio in August 2011 .
The video was filmed during a live show at Colorado 's Red Rocks Ampitheatre .
Brown told The Boot about the clip : `` It 's important that people come see our show , because we are performers .
We wanted people to see that .
We filmed last year at Red Rocks and got a helicopter and actually flew over and got some amazing footage and put all that beautiful stuff together .
We had two days of time-lapse -LSB- photography -RSB- .
The majesty of that place and the energy of our live show and the crowd is amazing .
It 's my favorite video we 've made so far . ''
Lyrically the song was inspired by a girl who Durrette was attracted to but was n't available .
They subsequently got together and at the time it was released as a single were dating .
The bridge is part of a separate song that Cowan had written , which Brown felt fitted well .
The song was Zac Brown Band 's seventh consecutive # 1 Country single , with eight of their past nine releases reaching the top spot .
The only one to miss out was `` Whatever It Is , '' which peaked at # 2 .
