This sober piano-driven track finds Minaj brooding about her personal struggles and the price of fame .
It features her singing with soft vocals rather than the rapid-fire rhymes the Queens MC is best known for .
The song was inspired by American actress Marilyn Monroe -LRB- 1926-1962 -RRB- , whose `` dumb blonde '' persona was used to comic effect in a series of 1950s comedies including Gentlemen Prefer Blondes -LRB- 1953 -RRB- and Some Like it Hot -LRB- 1959 -RRB- .
Despite being revered as one of the most prominent sex symbols during that period , the final years of Monroe 's life were dogged by personal problems caused by the constant media attention .
Since her tragic early death , aged 36 , she has become one of the most famous Hollywood icons of the twentieth century .
Several songs have been inspired by Marilyn Monroe 's struggles to do with fame , the best known being Elton John 's `` Candle In The Wind , '' which he later rewrote as a tribute to another tragic 20th century icon , Princess Diana .
Minaj told Artist Direct that the song came from producer J.R. Rotem .
`` On the first album , I did ` Fly ' with Rihanna , '' she recalled , `` and he produced that as well .
He hit me up and he said , ' I have a song that I think only an icon can sing . '
I was like , ` Oh J.R. , shut up ! '
-LSB- Laughs -RSB- We laughed a little bit on iChat .
He sent it , and I fell in love with the song . ''
When Minaj sings : `` Call me the cursed / Or just call me blessed / If you ca n't handle my worst / You ai n't getting my best / Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt ? ''
she is alluding to one of Monroe 's best-known quotes : `` I 'm selfish , impatient and a little insecure .
I make mistakes , I am out of control and at times hard to handle .
But if you ca n't handle me at my worst , then you sure as hell do n't deserve me at my best . ''
Like Monroe , Minaj puts a lot of pressure on herself , and the Queens MC believes she understands how the Hollywood star felt .
`` So much is taken out of you that you lose yourself , '' Minaj told NME .
`` I feel like I 've set the bar too high , so I always have to be ` on . '
I can identify with Marilyn Monroe in that people saw a beautiful woman , but inside was a fragile little girl . ''
Minaj loved the song as it spoke to her as a woman .
`` I 'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe , '' she explained to Artist Direct .
`` I had a moment with that song where I was like , ` Oh my God , every woman in this world needs to hear that . '
No , we 're not perfect .
Sometimes , we think , ` What 's wrong with us ? '
We spend so much time criticizing ourselves .
I needed to hear that , ` I 'm not perfect , but I 'm worth it . '
It resonated with me .
I felt like the world needed to hear it . ''
