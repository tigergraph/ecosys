The Doves explained to the NME April 11 , 2009 : `` There 's a lot of intensity on this album so we wanted this to be a breather .
It 's just a snapshot of walking through a forest . ''
For this song , the band bought in Baluji Shrivastav to play the delruba .
This is an Indian string instrument that is a cross between a sitar and a cello .
Frontman Jimi Goodwin explained to The Line Of Best Fit : `` I wanted an esraj which proved quite hard to sort out but the delruba is a close relative .
Andy -LRB- Williams , drums -RRB- heard the demo of the song which was quite crude , quite simple and it reminded him of ` Nobody 's Fault But My Own ' by Beck which is off the album Mutations , which we both love .
That 's got that that swirling Indian string feel to it .
And that got us thinking . ''
Andy Williams added : `` It seemed appropriate y' know .
For a start it 's got an Eastern melody and with the background vocals and that it seemed to lend itself to that instrument . ''
