Frontman and songwriter Conor O'Brien told Mojo magazine this tune focuses on a character sitting naked on a toilet suffering a nervous breakdown and believing he 's a soldier in the Brazilian War of Independence in 1822 : `` The feeling of that song for me is somebody who 's falling apart and I think the whole thing happens in his toilet , '' he explained .
`` He travels a lot in his head ; he gets involved in the Brazilian War of Independence and he confronts his imaginary maker , this maternal , goddess figure .
In the end he puts his head back on , puts his clothes back on and goes back into the world with a new love for humanity . ''
