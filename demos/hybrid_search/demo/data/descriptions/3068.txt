This song became a chart-crossing hit - peaking at # 4 on the Country chart , # 57 on the Hot 100 and # 11 on US Adult Contemporary - when Mary Chapin Carpenter covered it for her Come On Come On album in 1992 , four years after its initial release on Lucinda Williams ' eponymous album .
Carpenter 's version earned Grammy Awards for Best Country Song - also giving Williams her first Grammy as a songwriter - and Best Country Female Vocal Performance .
Lucinda wrote this song when she moved to Los Angeles with her boyfriend , Clyde Woodward , in 1984 .
In what she calls a `` burst of creativity , '' she also penned `` The Night 's Too Long '' and most of the songs for her Rough Trade album within that first year .
Clyde moved back to Texas after their breakup a few years later and died from cirrhosis of the liver in 1991 .
Lucinda remembered him in her song `` Lake Charles . ''
After the delayed success of this song brought welcome attention to Lucinda , she packed up for Nashville and bought a house and a car .
While the move did n't bring her everything she thought it would , it did inspire her work .
Her experience `` living in Nashville for years and having religion stuffed down my throat every day '' inspired `` Atonement '' from her 2003 album World Without Tears .
