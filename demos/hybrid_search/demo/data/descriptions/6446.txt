Speaking to Listen Before You Buy It , Waterhouse said of his songwriting technique that `` it 's really just everything that 's in my head .
It 's the way that little fragments and other ideas work , the kinds of experiences that I have all coming together . ''
`` Raina '' reflects this with personal , emotive lyrics that strongly a channel a particular emotion , filtered through vintage R&B styles - typical of much of Waterhouse 's music .
It appears on his 2012 debut album , Time 's All Gone .
Unable to afford session musicians , Waterhouse instead slowly built up his own backing band to perform on the record .
The band later toured with him under the name of The Tarots .
The track is a classic love song - it 's one of the slower numbers Waterhouse has recorded , and features straightforward lyrics that describe his burgeoning attraction to somebody he 's just met , presumably the titular Raina .
The chorus sums up the general sentiment of the song , repeating `` I 've got it for you '' until the song fades out .
In our 2012 interview with Nick Waterhouse , he named the song as one of his two favorites that he 's yet written .
His other favorite was `` Say I Wan na Know . ''
