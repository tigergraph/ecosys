This is the opening track of Eels ' Wonderful , Glorious album , which has a bright orange cover with a plane dropping bombs .
`` I 'VE had enough of being a mouse , I 'm no longer keepin ' my mouth shut , Bombs away ! ''
exclaims Mark Oliver Everett on this song .
`` It 's the sound of a man who has been pushed around a little too long , '' he explained to The Sun .
`` Suppression leads to explosions . ''
Eels plays a rainstick on this track .
`` We always had a rainstick in the studio as a joke , '' he told NME .
`` This big Brazilian amazon jungle type of thing .
It 's for jam bands and hippies .
We 're not a jam band and we 're not hippies .
So finally a night came when someone finally said ` let 's use the rainstick ! '
and I said ` OK , let 's try it . '
And it ended up on the record .
`` A rainstick is a long , hollow tube fashioned from the dried husk of a cactus , partially filled with small pebbles or beans .
When the stick is upended , the pebbles fall to the other end of the tube , making a chattering sound reminiscent of rain falling .
Its origins lie in Mesoamerican indigenous culture , and was played in the belief it could bring about rainstorms .
Everett explained to NME that a lot of the album is `` about fighting your way out of a situation . ''
He added : `` I did feel painted into a corner after doing the album trilogy thing in such a short amount of time .
It was hard to know where to go afterwards .
I think I was subconsciously dealing with that . ''
