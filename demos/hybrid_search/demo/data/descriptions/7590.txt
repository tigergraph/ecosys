Cole originally made this song in 2008 and based it around a sample of Finnish jazz saxophonist Eero Koivistoinen 's track `` Bells . ''
He explained to Billboard magazine : `` I started with these drums , and I was like , ` Man , what if I did these upbeat drums ... it can almost be a party .
What if I put this real emotional sample on it , ' and that 's what I did , I chopped up this sample . ''
Cole 's white mother , aunt and cousin raised him in Fayetteville , North Carolina .
His African American father left him at a young age , which is the subject matter of this song 's first verse .
Cole told Billboard magazine it 's `` probably the most personal song on the album . ''
