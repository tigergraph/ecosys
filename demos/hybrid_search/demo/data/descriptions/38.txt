Les Claypool shared the writing of Green Naugahyde between him , guitarist Larry ` Ler ' LaLonde and drummer Jay Lane .
The primus frontman insisted that everybody brought in some material , something that never happened in the band previously .
This more democratic process gave Claypool different perspectives .
He told MusicRadar : `` Take Ler 's music for Jilly 's On Smack : I would never write a song where I played a bunch of whole notes .
` Hey , everybody !
Follow me ... ' -LSB- laughs -RSB- How 's that gon na work ?
But Ler had this guitar part and arrangement , and I came in and supported it .
It 's very gratifying for everybody to work like that . ''
The song is about a friend of the band whom they lost to heroin addiction .
Claypool told Artist Direct : `` We have a friend who 's sort of disappeared from us because of the old magic poppy .
And I wrote that song almost from the perspective of the family : ` Where 's Jilly ?
She was always this wonderful successful person then all the sudden she 's just not going to be here this holiday . '
We 've had a lot of friends who we 've watched go through various times of turbulence over random chemical dependencies , a few of them on heroin .
You know my family on one side has really struggled with substance abuse , and if you look at my songs and Primus over the years , there 's a lot dealing with that : ` My Name Is Mud ' -- a couple of tweekers hanging out , one flips out and smashes the other 's head in with a baseball bat ; ` Jerry Was a Racecar Driver ' - Jerry gets drunk , wraps his car around a telephone poll ; ` Those Damned Blue-Collar Tweekers ' - I saw a lot of that mess when I was in the trade of carpentry .
