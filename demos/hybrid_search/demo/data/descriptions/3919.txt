This is the title track of Canadian singer-songwriter Fefe Dobson 's official sophomore studio album .
Her self-titled debut was released seven years previously in 2003 .
She explained to MTV News that the gap between the two records was down to the fact that she spent a few years making sure that Joy is just right .
`` It took so long because I wanted to make it perfect , '' said Dobson .
`` I 'm one of those people that I make a song ... then I write another song and then I 'm like , ` But this song is so much better than this song , ' and then I kind of ditch that song .
It 's a long process . ''
