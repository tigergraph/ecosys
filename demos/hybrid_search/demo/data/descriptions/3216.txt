The Welsh rock band Funeral for a Friend have had a number of comings and goings within their ranks .
The lineup that recorded their fifth studio album , Welcome Home Armageddon was : Vocalist Matthew Davies-Kreye , guitarists Kris Coombs-Roberts and Gavin Burrough , drummer Ryan Richards and bassist Richard Boucher .
Richards told the story of this sledgehammer of a song in an interview with Rock Sound magazine : `` Gav originally came up with the ` This Side of Brightness ' piece and we sat in my room trying to construct a song out of it .
As we were doing that Matt sent us an email saying that he had some lyrics he really liked that he thought would work well over a faster/punkier melodic-hardcore track , something along the lines of the bands we grew up listening to from that genre like As Friends Rust , Rise Against and Propaghandhi .
That gave us a bit of direction , the chords and melody from the intro worked really well played really fast - so became ` Old Hymns ' ! ''
