The song was co-written by Caillat 's boyfriend , musician Justin Young .
She told Billboard magazine the experience was , `` so much fun .
I 've never been interested in musicians before , and now having a boyfriend that plays amazing guitar and piano and has a beautiful voice ... it 's cheesy but it 's awesome , because we write these songs about our relationship and it brought us closer together . ''
Caillat and Young penned the song with Jason Reeves in Hawaii in 2010 .
She explained to AOL Music : `` It 's about how our relationship blossomed and how it surprised us .
-LSB- The -RSB- chorus of the song -LSB- is -RSB- , ' I remember like yesterday , lovin ' you seemed far away , we were friends in different places , then love began leavin ' traces . ' ''
