The Twilight Sad close their third album No One Can Ever Know with this unexpected track .
The band originally released it for free on their website and SoundCloud page on September 21 , 2011 .
Frontman James Graham told DIY : `` We released this as a download and was the first thing anybody heard from the album .
We knew it would surprise people and if you did n't give it repeat listens you might not get it .
In the context of the album it 's a perfect way to finish it .
Our past two albums have finished on quite slow songs , with this I think it goes out with a bang .
The last thing you hear on the album is my dry vocal shouting/singing . ''
