Co-singer/guitarist Ed Droste told Drowned in Sound : `` Recorded on Cape Cod , capturing the echo and reverb of the piano strings -LRB- we sung into it -RRB- .
To me it serves as a perfect breather , plus I love the guitar tone .
`` Droste added : `` Yeah this song really feels like our time up on Cape Cod .
Was never meant to be some grand song , it was more like a very soothing mood piece or something .
I love that you can hear the fire crackling in the background . ''
