This birthday song was written for Smith 's friend , the actor Johnny Depp .
She explained during the playback for the album : `` I went to visit him in Puerto Rico when he was filming Run Diary .
It was his birthday and I did n't have a present , so I wrote him a song . ''
Depp also contributed some guitar to the title track of Banga .
Smith told The Sun in 2012 about her friendship with Depp .
`` I met Johnny about five years ago , '' she said .
`` He and Vanessa -LRB- Paradis , his wife -RRB- and their daughter came to my concert in Los Angeles and said hello backstage .
We just really hit it off .
I lost my brother and really mourned him and it felt like he sent Johnny Depp to be my new brother .
We love the same books .
We talk endlessly about French literature and Jack Kerouac and Dylan Thomas .
We just have fun and a laugh and he 's such a great musician . ''
Long-time associate Tom Verlaine of Television plays the guitar break on this track .
`` What Tom does in that guitar break on ` Nine ' is unbelievable , '' Smith told The Sun .
It 's just like all the great records of the Sixties in just one run . ''
