Savages bassist Ayse Hassan told Coup De Main magazine about this clanging , atmospheric instrumental : `` It 's quite interesting because when we actually recorded ` Dead Nature ' it was just us with a hanging guitar going through effects pedals and just smashing it around and making beats , or trying to add different sounds to that track , '' she said .
`` For me it 's slightly quite haunting , and I think that it can be just as powerful as a song with lyrics or that 's structured .
What I quite like is that it follows no pattern - that recording is just how it was at that time .
It captures something that was n't necessarily planned , which I quite like . ''
