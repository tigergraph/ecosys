On October 9 , 2009 , Lavigne filed for divorce following three years of marriage to Deryck Whibley , the lead singer and guitarist for punk band Sum 41 .
On this delicate piano-and-string ballad , Lavigne finds the strength to close one chapter of her life and move on to the next .
She told Entertainment Weekly : `` It 's the most vulnerable song I 've ever written or recorded , and it inspires the album title . ''
This was one of two songs on Goodbye Lullaby that Lavigne wrote and produced entirely on her own - `` 4 Real , '' being the other track .
