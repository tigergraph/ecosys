Running to 5 minutes 9 seconds and not to be confused with any other song of the same name , the Phil Lynott number `` Hey You '' was co-written with drummer Brian Downey , and is the 9th and final track on the 1980 Chinatown album .
In an interview published in New Musical Express July 5 , 1980 -LRB- and reproduced on the journalist 's website in July 2011 -RRB- , Lynott told Paul Du Noyer : `` Every night I change the lyrics because I have n't got what I know I 'm trying to say .
It 's about how when you leave your home town everybody goes ` You 've got it made now man , you 're off ' .
And when you get to London you have n't , you 've just solved one set of problems for another .
And I 'm trying to get that ` Hey you got it made , your record 's in the hit parade ' and they do n't realise your problem now is getting the next hit or whatever.The amount of kids that go ' I wish I was you , you 've done everything ! '
and I think ` Jesus , if you only knew the problems I f -- kin ' have , trying to maintain , and improve ! '
`` The song has a slight reggae feel to it at the beginning , and although Lynott knew what he was talking about , he could n't have dreamed how prophetic his words would be ; by the time he gave the aforementioned interview , he had less than six years to live .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 2 -RRB-
