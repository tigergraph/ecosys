This is the opening track of American rock and jam band Gov ' t Mule 's eighth studio album , By a Thread .
This track features the guitar playing of ZZ Top 's Billy Gibbons .
Guitarist Warren Haynes explained to Billboard magazine how the collaboration came about : `` That was the last song we wrote and recorded for the CD , and when we listened back to it we thought , ` Wow , it 's kinda got an old school , early-ZZ Top vibe about it . '
We sent him the track and he loved it .
I flew to L.A. and sat in a room with Billy , and we overdubbed our guitars at the same time because I wanted us to be staring each other in the face when we did it .
He was so amazing and added so much to the track that it 's hard to think of it without him now . ''
