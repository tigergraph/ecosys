This Vices & Virtues track is a love song directed to Brendon Urie 's girlfriend Sarah Orzechowski . ''
` Sarah Smiles '' is about my girlfriend , actually , as sappy as that is , '' he told Spin magazine .
`` When I met her I wrote this song to try and impress her .
I was infatuated with her .
I played it for her and we 've been dating ever since .
That was a huge step for me , personally . ''
`` I was able to build up my confidence to write and try to woo her , '' he added .
`` I 'm a lucky guy . ''
Those of a certain age will remember a Hall & Oates tune of nearly the same title , which Daryl Hall wrote for his collaborator/girlfriend Sara Allen .
