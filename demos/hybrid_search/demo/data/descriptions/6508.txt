This is a lullaby to Johnson 's daughter , Kylee , who was aged 6 when The Guitar Song was released .
The singer explained to Associated Press writer Chris Talbott that his little girl has been on his mind as his growing success has pulled him away from Nashville more and more .
`` I have to figure out how to make time to come home and raise this kid , too , '' he said .
`` That entails a lot more than being a telephone number on the screen or a picture that she sees a lot .
To me that 's what 's taking a high priority these days . ''
