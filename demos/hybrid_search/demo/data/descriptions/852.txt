Girl Aloud Sarah Harding told The Daily Star March 25 , 2009 that the first time she heard this 1990 's style Electro Pop song , she loved it .
The singer explained : `` When we first heard the new single we thought it was so Nineties , a proper pop dance song .
It 's got that trancy , chilled Ibiza feel .
I get lost in the music at the beginning and then it builds and builds and builds .
You just want to go mental . ''
Like most of the other Girls Aloud songs , this was written and produced by the Xenomania production team .
This song peaked at # 11 bringing to an end Girls Aloud 's unbroken run of 20 straight Top 10 singles in the UK .
At 6 minutes 45 seconds , this was Girls Aloud 's longest song to date .
The futuristic video in which the five girls adopt a sexy sci-fi look was inspired by Stanley Kubrick 's classic sci-fi movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
The girls explained to The Daily Star : `` Five glass spheres fall at impossible speeds toward Earth .
Protected in these futuristic force fields Girls Aloud descend through space and time . ''
