This song was co-written by Katrina Elam , the Country singer who had a minor country hit with the original version of Carnival Ride 's `` Flat on the Floor . ''
Underwood told CMT News that she thinks music does change the world .
She added : `` The song `` Change '' - if somebody hears that and they 're like , ` You know what ?
I do change the channel every time I see one of those commercials asking me to donate .
Maybe I 'll call in , even if it 's 25 bucks . '
I mean , whatever you 've got in your pocket .
That 's what it 's saying - the smallest thing , the change in your pocket , can make such a difference .
If anybody sees that and wants to do something after that , wants to give money or donate their time - and time is money , so donate what you can - then it already has changed the world . ''
This ballad contains the lyric : `` The world is so big , it could break your heart . ''
CMT News asked Underwood what that line means to her ?
She replied : `` To me , there are so many problems in the world , it 's kind of like , ` Where do I start ? '
You know , you want to make a difference .
That 's what the whole song is about - the smallest thing .
If everybody does the smallest thing , it adds up to amazing , amazing things .
But people do n't see that .
They can be weighed down by all this stuff they see on the news or the things that are in their newspapers or people talking about something .
It just seems impossible . ''
