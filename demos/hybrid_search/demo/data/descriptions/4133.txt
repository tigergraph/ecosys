Darwin Deez mainman Darwin Smith wrote this song for his Australian lover , Alice , as well as his friends Rani and Meg whom he keeps in touch with through Skype marathons .
He told NME : `` I wrote this early on in the album process .
I found it nice to revisit the classic inspiration of ` writing a song for someone ' which had been absent from my approach for just long enough . ''
