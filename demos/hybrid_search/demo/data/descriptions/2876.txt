This is a single from indie singer-songwriter Rachel Yamagata 's third studio album , Chesapeake .
The lighthearted video traces the path of a romance between two completely different creatures , a lion and a rabbit .
It was directed by her half brother , the actor Josh Ruben .
`` I wanted to stray from the traditional way to tell a relationship story and yet still reference the bittersweet nature of a pair that falls in love , but must split for their very natures are at odds with one another , '' Yamagata told Spinner .
`` We want so badly to make things work , but sometimes we 've got to settle for as much a we can get for a time .
The lingering feeling always remains ... The costumes were insanely hot and we got some odd looks from the neighbors .
-LSB- It 's the -RSB- first wardrobe that I did n't feel self-conscious in .
Ha ! ''
