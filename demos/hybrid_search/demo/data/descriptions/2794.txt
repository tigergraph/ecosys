Justin wrote this song about not needing anyone else but his girl with Jive recording artist and producer Bei Maejor .
Justin shared on the MTV News Bieber Live special that he put a large amount of effort into creating quality tunes on Believe .
`` I was very involved in the process -LSB- of making this album -RSB- - I played instruments , produced , wrote - so I want people to know it 's not all hype , '' he said .
`` I want people to know I 've been working hard on my music .
Focus on the music .
Do n't think I 'm just this product pushed out there .
I work hard , and music is really important to me .
I see a lot of hate online , which is inevitable , but at the end of the day , I 'm just trying to prove them wrong by making good music . ''
