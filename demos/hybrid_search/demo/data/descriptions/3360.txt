This Rachel Thibodeau , Rebecca Lynn Howard and Jason Severs penned empowerment song has an R&B vibe .
When Martina first heard the demo she loved the feel of the song but it was the lyrics and the melody , which made her want to record it .
She told The Boot : '' I had never heard anything like it .
The woman in the song is strong and stands her ground .
She knows she has to leave if he does n't change , but she really does want him to change .
It 's bittersweet . ''
