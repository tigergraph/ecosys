Frontman Dan Haseltine discussed with CCM Magazine Long Fall Back to Earth 's theme of relationships and community : `` This record is a more intimate look at the over-arching theme we wrote about on Good Monsters .
There are no huge declarations on this record .
A lot of marriages were falling apart around us ; a lot of people were wrestling to find a foothold in their relationships .
We were pretty entrenched in the fight to find reconciliation and restoration for people .
These songs capture what we were living and experiencing over the last couple years .
This record is much more concrete in its imagery .
It is less lofty or poetic in some regards , because we were talking about the ground level human condition and how we hurt the ones we love , and how love endures and overcomes so many obstacles .
I did n't want to obscure the meaning of the songs by wrapping them in any obtuse language .
So the record is a bit simpler -- hopefully more relatable than most of what we have done in the past . ''
