Lead singer Sonny Sandoval : `` I think this is one of those songs where it was just a feeling and you can find whatever meaning you want in it .
Truby had originally written the music for his adopted son , Elijah .
To him , the lyrics reflect what Elijah would tell his biological mother .
For me , it 's about my mother or my grandfather .
It 's an extremely emotional song . ''
This song was the last song written and recorded for the album .
