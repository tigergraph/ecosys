Vocalist Dappy had a hard upbringing , living on tough estates and frequently getting into trouble with the law .
He is now settled with girlfriend Kaye Vassell who has borne him a child and the singer has vowed to tame his wild ways and become a responsible family man .
Dappy revealed that the lyrics `` Gon na be on my best behaviour , '' and `` how long before you save me baby , '' on this song were written with Kaye in mind .
He said to The Sun : `` Nobody knows what it is like having all these girls going crazy for you when you 're on tour .
They 'll do anything to come back to your bedroom . ''
