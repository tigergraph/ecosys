Rancid explained on their MySpace site : `` Plain and simple , this song is about the systematic suppression of ideas and censorship .
It 's also a protest song in the folk tradition of Woody Guthrie .
Scare tactics to keep us in fear are perpetuated by terror threat alerts and TV news programs who never concentrate their efforts on positive sides of life .
While the powers at the helm argue for their own agendas that keep them in disagreement , it seems they agree , side by side , to the greed and lust for more of their fair share of the American dream .
Some of us might be content on sharing a glance or a conversation .
Fat cats eventually sleep to long while the starving rabble stay awake waiting for a moment to strike .
The graffiti on the walls will always leave clues .
Follow them . ''
