Guitarist Quinn Allman : '' ` That 's my song .
It 's about the summer that me and my best friend spent , the summer after high school , we spent sleeping on patches of grass and drinking soda .
That song is kind of a flashback to me about being back in Utah .
We 'd just sit there and listen to music and talk to each other . ''
