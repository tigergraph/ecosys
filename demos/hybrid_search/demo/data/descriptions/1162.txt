Initially it was reported that this would be the lead single from Whitney 's seventh studio album , I Look To You .
However after most of the tracks were heard during some pre-release album listening parties , Houston 's official website stated the title song would be the first US single and Million Dollar Bill , the international lead single .
The song was written by Grammy award winning songwriter Diane Warren and produced by David Foster .
During the 2000s , Houston experienced considerable personal and professional turmoil , including the breakdown of her marriage to Bobby Brown and media speculation about drug use .
This song talks about how she survived her darkest hour and picked herself up .
Houston clarified the song 's meaning during a televised conversation with Oprah Winfrey .
`` I know from whence my help cometh .
And I know that it 's strong within me , '' she said .
`` If ever I get low , I get weak , I know where I can turn to .
I love the spirit of God so much . ''
