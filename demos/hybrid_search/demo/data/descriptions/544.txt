Halestorm frontwoman Lzzy Hale sings of self-love and accepting herself on this song .
The seemingly confident singer told freelance journalist Valerie Bastien that at times she 's battled a lack of self esteem .
`` Believe me , I do n't always feel like a rock star , and there are times when I look in the mirror and scream .
Especially emotionally , '' admitted Lzzy .
`` I used to hide a lot of my feelings of insecurity and powerlessness , and just would n't reach out to someone because I thought it meant that I was weak if I did .
I wanted people to see that it 's ok to need a shoulder sometimes , and to have those `` ugly days '' and to let down your guard .
We 're human and we 're not perfect ... do n't let those thoughts in your head rule your life and prevent you from opening yourself up . ''
The song features additional guitar work from Greek-born Canadian guitarist Phil Z , who is the co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Turbo Pop band Powder .
During the spring of 2011 , Phil X substituted for lead guitarist Richie Sambora for the last 13 American shows of Bon Jovi 's 2011 world tour .
