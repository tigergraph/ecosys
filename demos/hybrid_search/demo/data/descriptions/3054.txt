Lead vocalist Paul Noonan told Billboard magazine that `` in terms of realizing a vision for a song , '' this is his favorite track on Blue Lights On The Runaway .
He explained : `` I always had this idea of having a New Orleans brass section .
Somebody sent me links to YouTube footage of jazzer 's funerals in New Orleans and a band playing ' A Closer Walk With Thee . '
It has this wild energy that 's whipped up during the course of the song that 's really joyous but kind of sour occasionally , and woozy .
I really heard that flavor in this song ; it 's pretty conventional but juxtaposed with a brass section building to this crescendo .
I went online and eventually made contact with some musicians in New Orleans , sent them the songs , traded ideas until we landed on something we were happy with and recorded it .
It was very satisfying .
And then the three of us put down the extra percussion as if we were in the -LSB- brass -RSB- band , playing the big bass drum and the cymbals .
We did n't really have the swing , but it 's buried in there .
For a few minutes , we were striding . ''
