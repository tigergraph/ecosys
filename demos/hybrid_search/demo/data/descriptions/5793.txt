Curtis Lee wrote this with Tommy Boyce , who along with Bobby Hart , wrote many hit songs for The Monkees .
In his book How to Write a Hit Song and Sell It , Boyce explained that he was under orders from his publishing company to write a hit for Lee , who was an up-and-coming young singer .
When Lee went on tour , Boyce told him to think up a title , and inspired by a girl he met in Florida with beautiful eyes , returned with `` Angel Eyes . ''
Kent Kotal , who interviewed Boyce for the Forgotten Hits newsletter , explains what happened next : `` One of the most popular songs on the radio at the time was `` Ebony Eyes '' by The Everly Brothers .
Tommy started to play the chord progression of that tune , hoping for some spark of inspiration .
When that did n't work , he began to play the chords to that week 's # 1 song , `` Blue Moon '' by The Marcels .
The accelerated tempo of the Marcels ' song got them to singing their first lyrics : `` Angel eyes , I really love you so .
Angel eyes , I 'll never let you go . ''
They felt that they were on to something .
By evening , the lyrics were nearly complete.Feeling pretty good about what they had done , Boyce decided to take a walk and , while passing a record store , heard the old Cleftones ' hit `` Little Girl of Mine '' coming out of the loudspeakers .
As soon as he heard the beginning : `` Little , little , little , little , lit ... Yeah , little , little , little , little , lit , '' he knew that he had the intro for their new song .
Quickly , the opening lyrics became `` Pretty little angel eyes , pretty little angel eyes '' -LRB- and , ultimately , so did the title of the song ! -RRB- .
Amazingly , when they first performed the song for their publisher , he was n't impressed .
`` I thought I told you to write me a hit ! ''
He said again .
But Boyce and Lee were convinced that they had written a hit and decided to play it for their publisher 's girlfriend , who immediately loved the song .
She convinced her boyfriend that they had a smash on their hands and he finally gave the green light for Curtis to record the tune .
And a smash it was , becoming Curtis Lee 's only Top 40 hit .
Rock 'n' Roll revivalists Showaddywaddy re-made this in 1978 , taking it to # 5 in the UK charts .
Two years previously , the group achieved their only chart-topper with a cover of another Curtis Lee song `` Under The Moon Of Love . ''
Phil Spector produced this track .
Over the next few years , he became Pop music 's top producer , with hits like `` You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' '' and `` Be My Baby . ''
