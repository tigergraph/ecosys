This is the second single by British singer and 2009 X-Factor champion Joe McElderry from his debut album , Wide Awake .
McElderry 's record label considered changing the title to `` Somebody '' before settling on retaining Donkeyboy 's original song name .
McElderry explained to The Mail On Sunday , `` the song is about somebody doing something they 've always dreamed of -- which fits my whole journey . ''
This peaked at # 3 on the UK album chart , making McElderry the second X Factor champ to miss out on reaching # 1 following Leon Jackson , whose Right Now set could only manage # 4 .
The song is a cover of Norwegian pop band Donkeyboy 's hit single .
Their original version stayed at # 1 on the Norwegian Singles Chart for a total of 13 weeks in 2009 and it also topped the charts in Sweden .
The song 's music video was shot at Bulgaria 's Nu Boyana Film Studios .
Joe told 4Music that he came up with his own dance routine for the clip .
He explained to 4Music : `` The choreographer came up with the routine that the dancers were doing and I thought that this routine was too good to let pass .
I wanted to be in on this one !
I said to her , ` if I do n't look good you can take it out but at least let us try ! '
And it 's quite heavily featured in the video !
I 'm hoping it becomes one of those routines that everyone picks up and dances . ''
Joe told Digital Spy why he chose a cover as the lead single from his debut album : `` It obviously was n't an intentional thing for the first single to be a cover , but I do n't think it 's a particularly bad thing .
They 're not known here and it 's such a feel-good track - it was the first one throughout the whole recording process that made me sit up in my chair and think ` Wow ' .
Someone from the label played it for me to see if I 'd be interested in that style of music , and as soon as I heard it I wanted to record it immediately ! ''
