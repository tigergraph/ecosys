This single from the British Hip-Hop duo Rizzle Kicks ' debut studio album , Stereo Typical , is more laid-back and melancholic than their previous releases .
During an interview with Amaru Don TV , the Rizzle Kicks explained that the song originated with a beat titled `` Slow Gear '' sent to them by British songwriter/producer Ant Whiting .
It was one of number of beats that he 'd done for them and the Rizzle Kicks pair spent a week with Whiting recording this and four other songs for the album .
The song 's music video was directed and filmed by Toby Lockerbie , who 's worked with Rizzle Kicks on all six of their previous clips apart from the one for `` Mama Do The Hump . ''
The song finds the Rizzle Kicks duo of Jordan Stephens and Harley Alexander-Sule rapping about a journey .
They told Amaru Don TV the concept came about as a result of the traveling for work they were doing at the time : `` We were just like Piccadilly Circus and I just thought like , ` commuting ' .
I think what it was is that a lot of the tracks on the album are a lot more upbeat and we did n't want to lock into that more chilled vibe and the beat was wicked.We came up with a few concepts and none was really catching and I was thinking , like , I kept thinking of the idea of doing this journey and then I thought of the idea of journeys .
We wanted to write something for people who are in that same position of having to think about things in journeys . ''
