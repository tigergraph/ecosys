This is the third single released from country singer-songwriter Brett Eldredge 's debut album Bring You Back .
The song was inspired by the games that women play when it comes to dating .
`` I always wanted to write a song about how girls are very good at playing tricks on our minds , '' Eldredge told CBS Local .
`` I 'm sure we probably play tricks on their minds too , but they 're way better at it .
It 's just the little things , just the brush of their hair , that always get us . ''
When Brett Eldredge sat down to pen this song with Chris DeStefano and Ashley Gorley , he was thinking of how girls play tricks on their minds .
Speaking with Radio.com , Eldredge said he thinks this is the main reason why `` the tune has resonated with country fans .
`` I think that the guys see that girls play tricks on our minds and are like , ` Yeah they do that ! '
And the girls do the same thing and are like , ` Yeah , we do that , ' '' he said .
Eldredge added that it was helped by having `` a good feeling groove , '' something he tries to create in all his music .
`` If a song takes you to a place where you feel good as soon as it comes on , and the melody gets stuck in your head at the first chorus , and you 're just grooving and you 're dancing and it takes you to a place where you 're just happy , that 's what I love to do , '' Eldredge said .
`` To be able to instil an emotion in somebody and make them feel happy .
If they need a good cry , let them have a good cry or if they need to fall in love , or want to feel love , they hear a love song .
This song is just a sexy little flirtation song .
That 's what ` Do n't Ya ' does . ''
The song has been a live favorite from the first time Eldredge performed it .
`` Everybody likes to feel good .
The song does that .
I figured that out the first time we played it live , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` They wanted to groove to it , and those songs are sometimes hard to write .
But , this particular day , we hit a groove .
It made a connection with a crowd , and it 's been incredible . ''
