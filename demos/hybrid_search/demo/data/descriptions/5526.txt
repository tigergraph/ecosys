This delicate ballad featuring Songz 's falsetto finds him waxing lyrical about his accomplishments whilst wishing he could lift his community with him on `` top of the world . ''
`` Today , it 's kind of difficult to make a conscious record and still be successful , however brash that sounds , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` As much as is going on in the world , people are n't really checking for that real conscious record .
They want to dance , they want to hear bragging , all that stuff .
With that song , it was about telling people I worked hard for what I have-and I have a lot .
I 'm very fortunate .
But by that same token , I will give back to as many people as I can . ''
The song 's music video was filmed in Songz 's hometown of Petersburg , Virginia , and finds him joining in various activities with the locals such as shooting hoops and joining in at a house party .
