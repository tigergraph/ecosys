Frontman and songwriter Conor O'Brien told The Daily Telegraph that this atheist anthem started out `` pretty mental , drum and bass electronica , lyrics about cities crumbling and people dying , sounds of fire and apocalyptic thing .
`` After rehearsing the song with his band , it gradually transformed into `` a pretty straightforward folk rock song about smiling into the void . ''
Regarding the song 's meaning , O'Brien told The Sun it , `` is a sort of ode to meaninglessness , that absolute void that we all feel at some stage in our lives , if not every single day .
It sort of proposes that this void is the very thing that binds us all together as human beings on this planet . ''
O'Brien described this song to The Sun , as a `` tragi-comedy . ''
adding that he `` was very much influenced by Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut - that feeling of deep , dark moments being placed alongside compulsive hilarity .
`` American writer Kurt Vonnegut -LRB- 1922 - 2007 -RRB- was a 20th-century American writer , who was known for his humanist beliefs and satirical novels .
Slaughterhouse-Five -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , which is generally recognized as Vonnegut 's most influential and popular work , drew on his experience as a World War II prisoner of war in Germany when he witnessed the destructive bombing of Dresden .
Vonnegut was one of a group to survive the attack in an underground slaughterhouse meat locker used by the Germans as an ad hoc detention facility .
His satirical novel has inspired a number of other songs .
They include : `` Everything Is Automatic '' by Matthew Good -LRB- The lyric `` Those birds are singing '' was taken from a line in the book -RRB- .
`` And So It Goes '' by Billy Joel and `` So It Goes . ''
-LRB- Both song titles taken from a recurring line in the book used every time a death occurs -RRB- Also English alternative rock band Billy Pilgrim took their name from the novel 's soldier protagonist .
This was the only song on -LRB- Awayland -RRB- that was written by O'Brien in one session .
He explained to WhiteTapes : `` I literally woke up and it was in my head .
Like a Paul McCartney moment .
This never happened to me before or after .
I just sang it to my computer and recorded so that was a quick song .
The others were very long and slow and just , really teasing . ''
