Matthew Shafer , aka Uncle Kracker , was born in Mississippi but raised in Harrison Township , a charter township of Macomb County in Michigan .
The first single from the Country-Pop rocker 's fifth album , Postcards From Home finds him singing of the strong connection he feels towards his hometown .
Shafer told The Boot : `` I 'm proud of where I come from - town , state and country .
But I spend a lot of time on the road , and I can see that we 're all pretty much the same .
We have different accents , different industries , different weather maybe , but we 're all just trying to live our lives , pay our bills , give our kids a better life and have some good times . ''
Shafer recorded Postcards From Home over seven weeks in early 2011 .
He told Billboard magazine that the album title was inspired by his hectic life on the road after his successful Happy Hour longplayer .
`` It feels like I have n't been home in a couple of years , '' he explained .
`` If I go home for three days or something , that 's a lot .
This is probably the busiest couple of years I 've had in 10 years .
And I did n't write any of these songs at home , either .
So being gone , it was like having a different home .
I just like the little play on words . ''
