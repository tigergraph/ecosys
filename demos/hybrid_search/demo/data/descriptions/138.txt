Frontman Ryan Clark told Alternative Press about Patrick Judge 's guitar work on this song : `` I really like how the keys bring out the lead guitar melody in the chorus , '' he said , `` which was our producer Aaron Sprinkle 's idea .
You can hear Patrick 's handiwork in all of the lead guitars .
I especially like the creepy guitar line that comes in over the outro and finishes the song ... probably because it reminds me of a Slayer lead . ''
The chorus is made up of two chorus melodies that Clark was trying to decide between and he eventually decided to combine the two .
This cut features the only tempo change on True Defiance - at the very end of the song .
Clark explained to Alternative Press : `` When I finished writing the song I kept hearing this tempo drop in my head , so I just had to add it .
I think it adds a really unexpected dynamic to the song . ''
