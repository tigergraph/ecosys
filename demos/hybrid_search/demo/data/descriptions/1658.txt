In a March 2009 interview with the Dutch website FaceCulture , lead vocalist Biff Byford explained the genesis of this song.It started around 2007 in rehearsal ; he was talking to a journalist from the music magazine Metal Hammer who told him `` You should write a battle hymn '' .
The title came to him just like that ; the song is based on the Roman legions marching off to war trumpets blazing , but , added Biff , like most Saxon songs of this type , it is actually an anti-war song .
It is also a double entendre , and refers equally to the legions of metal fans .
