This was the title track to Hatebreed 's sixth album , which followed their 2009 self-titled effort .
They started putting riffs together in 2011 and played early versions of the songs when they toured with Five Finger Death Punch .
They continued to refine the songs the following year when they toured with Lamb of God , making sure they played well in a live setting .
In our interview with Hatebreed lead singer/lyricist Jamey Jasta , he said : `` A lot of people ask me what ` The Divinity of Purpose ' is about , a lot of people think it 's about a person .
I think in the liner notes , because I had to write something , I might have alluded to that .
But it could be about music , it could be about your dog , it could be about an ex or a family member .
I like to have it be open to interpretation . ''
