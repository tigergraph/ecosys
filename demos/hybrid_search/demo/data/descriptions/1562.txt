This song is about how many people consider Megadeth a `` Victory '' or success , when they do n't know what group founder Dave Mustaine went through to get to that point .
The lyrics , `` Had fingers in my eyes , needles in my veins '' is a reference to his battle with drugs .
`` A knife right through my heart '' could refer to his former band Metallica , or past relationships that went badly .
-LRB- thanks , Nicholos - Farmville , VA -RRB- The lyrics are basically a compilation of previous Megadeth song titles from the albums Killing Is My Business ... And Business is Good through Countdown to Extinction .
Mustaine recalled to Artist Direct : `` The guys in the band had said something , ` Why do n't you do a song that has all of our song titles in it ? '
I thought , ` That reminds me of those K-tel Records . '
We started goofing around , doing music , and talking about the titles and how they fit .
It seemed clever , but I had n't done anything like it . ''
