Mount Eerie is the creation of Phil Elverum , a Washington State musician who previously recorded as The Microphones .
In 2012 , he released two albums : Clear Moon and Ocean Roar .
While there are many contrasts across songs , references to nature are a constant .
In `` The Place Lives , '' Elverum sings about the clouds moving across the sky regardless of whether we 're looking at them .
`` The weather and the world around us does n't care about us , '' he explained in our 2013 interview .
`` It 's just ongoing whether or not we 're paying attention to it .
I guess that 's meant to set an atmosphere of human insignificance . ''
