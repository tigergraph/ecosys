Miranda told the Associated Press 's Chris Talbott that the song was inspired by her relationship with her beau , Blake Shelton .
`` I kind of felt that feeling come over me , '' she said .
`` That 's my fianc√© .
That 's going to be my husband .
I 'm going to keep him safe .
I feel safe with him .
So that 's definitely some insight into my softer side . ''
Miranda penned this love song backstage , whilst watching Shelton perform .
She explained to Reuters : `` I had gone out to meet him at one of his shows and I was watching him from the side of the stage .
I went to the bus for a minute , and I had on these fringy boots , and as I was walking the fringe was kind of swaying to his music .
I could hear his voice in the background , and it sparked this feeling in me , and I went on the bus and wrote the song . ''
