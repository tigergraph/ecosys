This was the first song to be made available from Canadian rapper Drake 's sophomore release , Take Care .
He explained in a post on his blog on May 20 , 2011 that he made the tune available early as it was just something he `` felt the need to share , '' adding , `` This is a story of dreams mixed with reality . ''
The song was omitted from the final track listing of Take Care .
The Noah `` 40 '' Shebib produced tune samples British songwriter and record producer Jai Paul 's 2007 `` BTSTU . ''
It finds the Canadian MC concerned about the current state of hip-hop and lamenting that his favorite MC 's have either died or fallen off .
`` I feel like lately it went from top five to remaining five / My favorite rappers either lost it or they ai n't alive , '' Drake spits .
