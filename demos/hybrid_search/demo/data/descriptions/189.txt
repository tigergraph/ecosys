The song title is both the name of a speech given by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953 and the motto of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
In 2009 Yorke gathered a band of musician friends together to see if The Eraser could be played live .
They toured briefly , initially billed warily as '' ?????? '' , before being named `` Atoms for Peace '' after this song .
The song opens with the lines `` No more going to the dark side with your flying saucer eyes .
No more falling down a wormhole that I have to pull you out . ''
According to The Observer newspaper , they refer to `` something of an admonition '' from Yorke 's wife Rachel to him to lighten up .
