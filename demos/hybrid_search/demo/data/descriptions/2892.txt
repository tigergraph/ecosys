It was debuted as Zane Lowe 's Hottest Record In The World on BBC Radio 1 , October 3 , 2012 .
Troy told Coup de Main magazine about the album title .
`` It is a conjunction of two words : the word ` sisters ' and the word ` histrionics , ' '' she explained .
`` That was a really genius idea Julie came up with when we first started as a band for the name of our first release . ''
Drummer Julie Edwards told NME regarding the song : `` We just really wanted to say something positive .
We 're total peaceniks .
We think everybody should chill out and get together . ''
