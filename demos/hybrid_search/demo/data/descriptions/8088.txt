This is a single recorded by Swedish DJ and dance producer Tim Berg .
The song features the vocals of house singer Amanda Wilson who first shot to fame in 2005 after teaming up with The Freemasons on their worldwide smash hit `` Love On My Mind , '' and its 2006 follow-up , `` Watchin .
`` Following her success with the Freemasons ' first album , Wilson went on to provide lead vocals for their 2008 remix of Gusto 's `` Disco 's Revenge , '' which gave her a third Top 40 hit in the UK .
Berg told the story of this song in an interview on the Ministry of Sound website : `` Well when I first released the instrumental of ` Bromance , ' a couple of French producers called Alviin & Da Frenchy did a bootleg with an old Amanda Wilson track called `` The Love U Seek . ''
Then Ministry of Sound contacted me and wanted to release it as a vocal version - so we got Amanda herself to redo the vocals and it sounded great so we just went for it ! ''
