This song is from American pop music artist Miley Cyrus ' third studio album , Ca n't Be Tamed .
The Hannah Montana star conceived the tune in December 2009 in London , while traveling on the Wonder World Tour .
The lyrics are about the desire of not living up to `` the form and the machine everyone thinks you should be . ''
Prior to the release of Ca n't Be Tamed , the former Hannah Montana star told MTV News that she 's a completely different person to when she released 2008 's Breakout .
Miley said : `` I 'm much more confident .
You know , I 've always been a confident person , but I was going through a lot then .
I was younger , and I did n't really know myself .
`` She added , `` There 's so many people in your life telling you who you should and should n't be .
And that 's what Tamed -LSB- is -RSB- about .
It 's about being who you are to the fullest .
And now I know who that is .
`` This song is one of the Tamed tracks that Miley thinks best fits that development .
`` It 's about not letting people tell you who you should n't and should be , '' she said .
`` And -LSB- it 's -RSB- about people that try to tell you : ` This is what you need to sell . '
` Look relatable . '
It 's like , ' I am relatable . ' ''
