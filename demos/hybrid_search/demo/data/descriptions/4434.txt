Like most songs on the Living With War album , this was written and recorded all in one day .
On a 2006 appearance on The Colbert Report , Neil had some fun with the faux-conservative host .
In a staged bit , the pair pulled out acoustic guitars , and Young began teaching Colbert this song .
When Young sang the title , Colbert feigned shock and threw to commercial .
This song deals with US president George W. Bush , and Young 's desire to remove him from office .
In the 40th anniversary issue of Rolling Stone magazine , Young said this is `` A political song about something that 's so wrong that the only way to point out how wrong it is is by doing a song that 's wrong - smashing and pounding away at it .
A lot of people criticized it as a crappy song , that it was such a terrible melody .
You want a melody that pisses people off , that 's so stupid and repetitive that it aggravates people . ''
