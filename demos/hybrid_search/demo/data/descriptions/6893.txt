This slice of indie-disco was the first song that Two Door Cinema Club wrote after the release of their debut album , Tourist History .
The band debuted the tune during their September 24 , 2010 gig at the O2 Academy in Oxford , England .
Frontman Alex Trimble told NME : `` We played it live the week after we wrote it and it 's just stuck with us . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Sam Pilling -LRB- Wu Lyf , SBTRKT and David Lynch -RRB- and was filmed in a north London bowling alley .
The clip stars Martin Hancock , who is best known for playing Spider Nugent in Coronation Street and features the band members ' decapitated heads rolling down a bowling lane .
`` It 's a bit of a break with the past , '' bassist Kevin Baird told NME .
`` I think we 've done one or two very good videos and a couple of very average ones .
We wanted to do something a bit spectacular this time , and I honestly do think it 's the best thing we 've ever shot .
`` Unsurprisingly the horror-inspired visual was banned by MTV .
