Mraz told Spin magazine that this is `` a song of longing . ''
He explained : `` I would call it a fictional tale , but it 's based on real events , and it 's about how there are plenty of things you can do that are great by yourself , but doing them with someone else is better . ''
Mraz told Billboard magazine this is `` perhaps my favorite song that I 've written . ''
He explained : `` It uses the least amount of words , but yet it paints the biggest pictures in my mind that I 've been able to go to as far as where I like to go in romantics . ''
