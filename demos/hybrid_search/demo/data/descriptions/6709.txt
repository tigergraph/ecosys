Vocalist Josh Franceschi told The Sun February 12 , 2010 about this song : `` All our lyrics are based on my personal life .
For example ` The Consequence ' is based on a talk I had with my mum .
I wanted to pack being in a band and leave .
I could n't take the pressure of this album .
She said I was being an idiot and I snapped out of it a week later . ''
