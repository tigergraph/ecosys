Mumford & Sons unveiled this song during a performance at Philadelphia station Radio 104.5 On October 29 , 2011 .
It finds Marcus Mumford singing of a broken relationship that he hopes can be repaired : `` But I will hope as long as you like , just promise me we 'll be all right . ''
`` Ghosts '' features an instrumentation of acoustic guitar , banjo and accordion and when performed live , it allows the band a chance to catch their collective breath .
`` It 's fun to play ... it 's a kind of respite for us to just stand back and play a slower song , '' Mumford told MTV News with a laugh .
`` It 's nice : gives us a moment to take stock . ''
The song evolved as the result of the band performing it to audiences and tinkering with it afterward .
`` That one came together really on our Canadian tour about a month ago , the first time started playing it , '' multi-instrumentalist Winston Marshall told MTV News .
`` We tried recording it before , but it then took on a new life when we played it on that tour .
... -LSB- The songs -RSB- always change when we play them live ; the dynamics change a lot .
When you play it to a new room , you 're playing it to new ears , and you 're listening to the song through their ears .
So it 's really great to feel the song out . ''
