Rehab was the fourth album released by Christian rapper , Lecrae .
According to the website of his record label , Rehab 's `` motto '' is `` The Christian life is an entrance into rehab . ''
The highly conceptual album is centered on the release and freedoms from inhibiting addictions and habits .
This song is the opening track , in which Lecrae raps rhymes about the Christian `` checking in '' to `` rehab , '' thus introducing the underlying storyline .
Rehab was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album at the 2011 Grammy Awards but lost out to Switchdown 's Hello Hurricane .
Lecrae has personal experience of substance abuse and he told us : `` That 's something some people know and some people do n't know , just my history and me wrestling with drugs and how I was able to overcome that .
And alcohol , as well .
It 's kind of like how much of a crutch in my life it was , not being able to function on a regular basis without it .
So just saying , man , at the end of the day rehabilitation means that something is broken , and it 's supposed to look like this , but it 's broken .
I think that 's what God wants to do with us as individuals .
We 're broken , we 're fractured , we 're messed up , and need rehabilitation . ''
