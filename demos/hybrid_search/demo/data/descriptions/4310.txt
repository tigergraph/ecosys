Largely because of this single , Ashanti 's first album debuted at # 1 and sold over 500,000 copies .
The week her self-titled debut album was released , she held the # 1 and # 2 spots in the Billboard Hot 100 , with this song and her collaboration with Fat Joe , `` What 's Luv ? ''
With her collaboration with Ja Rule , `` Always on Time , '' also in the Top 10 , Ashanti thus became the first artist since The Beatles to have her first three singles charting in the Top 10 simultaneously .
Additionally Ashanti had co-written a fourth song in the same week 's Top 10 , Jennifer Lopez 's `` Ai n't It Funny . ''
Ashanti 's record company offered stores a $ 2 rebate on every copy of this album sold the first 2 weeks it was released , which meant the CD was priced much lower than others .
As a result , it went to # 1 , providing a great deal of publicity that made up for the rebate .
This ploy made record companies examine their pricing , as CD prices kept going up while sales were going down .
Ashanti 's self-titled debut album was released earlier than scheduled due to the immense success of this song .
Ashanti says this song is about `` making mistakes in love . ''
The track is built around a keyboard sample from the 1983 DeBarge song , `` Stay With Me . ''
Notorious B.I.G. used the same sample on his hit `` One More Chance . ''
Mariah Carey also borrowed from `` Stay With Me '' on her 2008 track `` I 'll Be Lovin ' U Long Time . ''
Ashanti wrote this herself , as she does all of her songs .
She feels that singing her own material allows her to inflect more emotion into her work .
