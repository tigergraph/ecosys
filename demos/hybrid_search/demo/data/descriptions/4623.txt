Vocalist Matt Tuck explained this tune to The Aquarian Weekly : `` The song is about dignity and pride , and standing up for what you believe in and not letting anyone put you down .
I have to put up with people who do n't know me , but think they do , and I have to put up with criticism just for the sake of people who do n't like the music , but that 's cool .
That 's who I am , that 's what I do .
F -- k you , that 's what the song is about .
I am not going to change who I am or what I do .
I would rather die with dignity than bow down to you , it 's kind of sad , but it comes with the territory of being in a rock band . ''
