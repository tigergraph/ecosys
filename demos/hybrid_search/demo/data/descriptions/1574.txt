This was the band 's first hit in the UK .
The song also reached # 1 in Australia despite the band doing no promotional work there .
It 's Australian success was based on the strength of the radio play and its stylish video featuring the band performing against a futuristic , glacier-styled backdrop .
Duran Duran were seen as poster boys for the New Romantics , and one of this song 's lyrics namechecks the early '80s musical movement , before its moniker was in wide usage .
The band took it from the headline for a newspaper article on Spandau Ballet that read : `` Here Come The New Romantics . ''
Bassist John Taylor recalled to the A.V.Club in a 2012 interview : `` I remember reading it and thinking , ` Wow , it sounds like they 're doing exactly what we 're doing , ` and calling the journalist in London and saying , ` Hey , if you like them , you 're gon na love us ! '
-LSB- Laughs . -RSB-
And then in the meantime , I thought , ` Let 's put that ` New Romantic ' phrase into one of our songs . ' ''
Drummer Roger Taylor was asked in an interview with Q magazine -LRB- February 2008 -RRB- what inspired the band to latch onto the new idea of the promo video .
Taylor replied : `` The video for Ultravox 's ` Vienna ' came out and -LRB- manager -RRB- Paul Berrow said , ` You can do one of those . '
Paul was very switched on and ambitious and so we did the ` Planet Earth ' video .
When the song started getting support in Australia , Duran Duran decided that they needed to get some television presence down there , so it was suggested that they make an accompanying promo .
John Taylor admitted to The A.V. Club , `` that was the primary motivation for doing that video ... to support the song in Australia . ''
