Taylor Swift explained the background to this tune , which she penned with Liz Rose and Brian Maher : `` I wrote this song about a couple who lived next door to us .
They 'd been married forever and they came over one night for dinner , and were just so cute .
They were talking about how they fell in love and got married , and how they met when they were just little kids .
I thought it was so sweet , because you can go to the grocery store and read the tabloids , and see who 's breaking up and cheating on each other -LRB- or just listen to some of my songs , haha -RRB- .
But it was really comforting to know that all I had to do was go home and look next door to see a perfect example of forever . ''
