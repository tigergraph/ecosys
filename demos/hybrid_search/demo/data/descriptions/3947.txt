This song was written by the band 's keyboard player Kevin Moore , who left the band shortly before the album was released .
The band has never performed the song live .
Kevin Moore said of this song : `` I was looking through a clothing catalog and saw a picture of a girl modeling this piece of clothing called a space-dye vest .
And , so , I fell in love with her -LSB- laughs -RSB- for some strange reason and so the minute I did that , the minute I was just like obsessed with this person , I was like , ` why am I doing that ? '
and I noticed that I was doing it a lot lately .
And I think the prime reason that I was doing that , and this is what I figured out at the time , was that I had just come out of a relationship where I 'd gotten dumped , basically , and so I think the situation was that I was n't finished giving all that I was ready to give , so I was just , like , throwing it around , you know , just aiming it in different directions .
It was a total case of projection .
And this song is just trying to sort it out and just kind of admitting that I 'm just kind of lost .
So it 's kind of a dark song .
It was very cathartic though . ''
