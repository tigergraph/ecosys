This is the title track of Northern Irish singer/songwriter Van Morrison 's , album which was released in 1999 .
The optimistic lyrics are about being successful both in one 's personal relationships and also in one 's professional life .
The session musician Geraint Watkins played Hammond organ on this track .
He told the The Observer Music Monthly June 2009 that recording with Morrison is `` really good , because it 's all live .
He records everything from the minute you start ; there 's plenty of bloody pressure with Van !
Sometimes he just sits with a guitar and starts singing .
We 'll start playing along and when he finishes that 's it - that 's the take .
I wish it could always be like that .
It really is a buzz , because there 's no hiding place . ''
