This song is about people who lead a monotonous life , doing the same things the same way , day after day .
They never take risks and are content living this way until they die .
Matthews compares these people to ants who perform the same daily tasks over and over .
The last line to the second verse , '' ... Are under the table and dreaming , '' is where the title of the album comes from .
