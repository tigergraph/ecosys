This was one of two new tracks recorded by The Foo Fighters for their 2009 greatest hits compilation .
The band premiered this song at the 4th of July 2009 show in front of President Obama on the South Lawn at the White House .
The Independence Day celebration was held to honor military heroes and the band entertained an audience of over 1200 active military troops and families .
In the aftermath of its release fan reaction was somewhat tepid to this song .
However , frontman Dave Grohl told MTV News he would n't have it any other way .
`` We kind of took it in this direction that we have n't gone before , which , as a band , is exciting , '' he explained .
`` You do a song like ` Wheels ' and people go , ` Really ?
That 's the Foo Fighters ? '
People get all scared .
` Oh no , is that the direction they 're going ? '
It 's one of those songs that our biggest fans hate .
I like that we have songs that lots of different people either enjoy or dislike . ''
The song was recorded at the band 's 606 Studios with Nevermind producer Butch Vig at the controls .
Grohl described this at the White House concert as , `` the feeling when the wheels touch the ground and you 're like ` Oh , God , I 'm glad that 's over with , man ! ' ''
