This upbeat Pop-Rock tune was the first song to be released from Train 's sixth studio album .
It was already familiar to some of their fans as the band had been performing the tune during their 2011 Summer Tour .
It was made available on iTunes starting January 10 , 2012 a week after Train played the halftime show at the 2012 Discover Orange Bowl in Miami .
The song featured on `` The Package '' episode of Hawaii Five-0 on January 16 , 2012 .
Monahan was assisted with the writing of the song by the Espionage , the Norwegian songwriting and production duo of Espen Lind and Amund Bjorklund that helped Train put together its 2010 hit `` Hey Soul Sister . ''
Frontman Pat Monahan penned the song during Train 's 2011 tour of Australia .
Train 's singles tend to gradually build momentum but this song debuted at # 60 on the Hot 100 in its first week as Triple A and hot AC and pop radio all embraced the song with enthusiasm .
Speaking with Billboard magazine , Monahan said : `` We 're not used to that kind of thing .
Usually Train is a very slow build .
` Hey Soul Sister ' and ` Drops Of Jupiter , ' ` Calling All Angels , ' everything took a long time to manifest into hit songs . ''
Monahan is singing about a guy who is attempting to convince a girl that their one-night-stand was not just a `` drive by . ''
The protagonist insists that he wants a lasting relationship .
Speaking with Digital Spy the Train frontman admitted that it is `` an indirect song about meeting -LSB- his -RSB- wife . ''
Monahan added : `` I really did not expect I was going to fall in love with her that day .
I said I 'm never going to move to Washington where you live and I 'm never going to have kids or get married , just so you know .
So we 've been married five years , we live in Washington and we have two children and that whole threat worked out great . ''
