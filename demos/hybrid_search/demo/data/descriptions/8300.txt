18 days before the 2009 Grand Finale of American Idol , David Cook 's older brother Adam succumbed to brain cancer .
Though This Loud Morning never explicitly references his brother 's death , it does give certain songs a deeper meaning .
This song finishes with Cook sighing , `` Time marches on without you '' as a funereal vocal arrangement takes over .
Cook wanted This Loud Morning to have a loose theme running though it , which described the gestation cycle of a relationship .
He told Billboard magazine : `` To me , ` Time Marches On ' is the tipping point of the album .
Up until that point , I think every song had been about the hopeful side of love and life and all that , and ` Time Marches On ' is that tipping point where you move to the next stage of grief where all of a sudden it 's like , ` OK , no matter what happens , the clock 's gon na keep moving and we all have a finite amount of time . ' ''
