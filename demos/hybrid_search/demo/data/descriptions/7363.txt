This Christmas single by Las Vegas rock band The Killers was released as a digital download on November 30 , 2010 .
All proceeds benefit the Red Hot Organization , an international charity dedicated to raising funds and awareness for HIV and AIDS .
The music video was directed by Jared Hess -LRB- Napoleon Dynamite -RRB- .
It starts with footage of the classic Christmas holiday movie , It 's A Wonderful Life , which is also name-checked in the song 's lyrics .
The clip from the movie is used to introduce the song with the famous dialogue , `` dear father , I 'm not a praying man , but I 'm at the end of my rope ... show me the way . ''
The song finds front man Brandon Flowers reflecting on the past as he approaches the end of another year , and it continues The Killers ' tradition of releasing a holiday single every year .
This is their fifth consecutive annual Christmas song since 2006 , the others being `` A Great Big Sled '' , `` Do n't Shoot Me Santa '' , `` Joseph , Better You Than Me '' and `` Happy Birthday Guadalupe . ''
