50 Cent wrote this with Justin Timberlake , Timbaland and Nate Hills .
Timberlake sings on the track , providing a Pop hook that helped push the song into the mainstream .
Timbaland , who produced the track with Hills , also adds vocals .
The song is about how technology creates an unfortunate distance and can hinder intimacy .
Of course , this being 50 Cent , the song is set in a strip club : `` She work the pole ... she about the dough . ''
50 Cent told MTV News abut working with Timbaland : `` When me and Timbaland go in , a lot of times it 's a compromise .
He 's doing things that 's a little different production-wise from what I would usually do .
Like ` Ayo Technology ' - you never heard me rap with that cadence .
That beat was actually for Justin -LSB- Timberlake -RSB- .
It was golden , some s -- t he had on the side , and he gave it to me .
I went and did it .
Justin laid the hook to it . ''
In September , 2008 , the Belgian musician Milow recorded an acoustic cover version for the Charity Event `` Music for Life , '' which was organized by the Belgian national radio station Studio Brussel .
It got a tremendous response , and the song was released as a single and a video made .
This version hit # 1 in Belgium and the Netherlands .
For anyone watching the video and wondering what the stuff is coming out of his mouth and on his head : it 's honey .
