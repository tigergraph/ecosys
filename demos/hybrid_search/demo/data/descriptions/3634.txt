This is a duet with American singer Jolie Holland .
Gray commented to Billboard magazine : `` It 's got some charm to it , that one .
It 's just held its own amongst these bigger numbers .
Holland 's vocals just lifts the song out .
She 's a star ; she 's a rare thing . ''
Gray admitted to Sunday Times August 31 , 2009 that Holland was n't his first choice .
He explained : `` I sang these backing vocals on the song and when I heard them back , they were so country , I thought , I 've got to get Dolly Parton singing this .
So I wrote her a letter : ` Dear Dolly , you would n't believe how many times I 've listened to you and Chet Atkins singing Do I Ever Cross Your Mind , ' and so on ... The next morning , I called my management and said , ` Do n't send it , it 's too gushy , I 'll rewrite it , ' and they said , ` Do n't bother , we 've already sent it , and we 've already got the reply .
Dolly 's busy for the next five years . ' ''
So Gray had to think again and the answer came when he went to see Holland in concert .
`` We were both a bit nervous when she came into the studio , '' said Gray .
`` It was the first time I 'd done anything like that , and I was trying to make her sing like me - which , surprisingly , did n't work .
Eventually , Robbie -LSB- Malone , bass -RSB- pointed out that what she was doing was so much better than what I wanted her to do . ''
