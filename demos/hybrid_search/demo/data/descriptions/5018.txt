The Black Keys duo of Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney recorded this with producer Brian `` Danger Mouse '' Burton in a number of different ways before settling on the version that can be heard on the El Camino album . ''
` Little Black Submarines ' began as a demo that Brian and Dan made , '' Carney recalled to American Songwriter magazine , `` but we completely changed the song around .
We cut it four or five different ways , then we cut a really stripped-down version with acoustic guitar .
We had a louder version , too , but it was n't completely working , so we decided to combine the two by going into the studio and punching in a new ending .
That whole ending is the first take we played , just figuring out what we 're doing and riffing on that idea .
That 's why that part of the album feels the loosest .
It 's how Dan and I play .
It 's live in the studio , just guitar and drums , with the instruments bleeding into reach other . ''
The Springwater Supper Club venue is a former speakeasy .
`` It 's a really cool building , '' Auerbach said to Rolling Stone : `` It 's been there forever .
It 's got a lot of history .
It 's one of three or four different little small dive bars in town .
It 's special because it 's so old . ''
The Danny Clinch-shot video shows the Black Keys performing at Nashville 's Springwater Supper Club bar .
The clip came about after the original story-based idea fell through .
Auerbach told Rolling Stone : `` We all just sort of kind of mutually agreed that it should probably just be the performance and not any of the other extra stuff .
Luckily we had live footage so we turned it into a live video .
We just sort of said ` You know , it was fun kind of performing here at a small club with the fans .
Why do n't we just have it be that ? ''
