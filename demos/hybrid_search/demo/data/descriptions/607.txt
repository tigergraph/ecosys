This song is a bonus track on the Limited Yearbook Edition of Up All Night .
It was written by Roy Stride , who is the frontman of Scouting For Girls , a group who have clocked up several Top 10 hits in their native UK , including `` Elvis Ai n't Dead , '' `` Heartbeat '' and the chart-topping `` This Ai n't A Love Song . ''
Stride also had a song shortlisted for 1D 's third album , Midnight Memories , but it did n't make the final cut .
Asked how he approaches writing a track for the biggest boyband in the world , Stride told Digital Spy : `` I used to think , ` Ah , let 's write a song for a boyband , ' whereas now I 've just realised you 've got to write a f -- ing good song .
To get on a One Direction album - every single songwriter in the world wants to get on it - you 've just got to write an absolutely amazing song .
I do n't think about who it 's for , I 've just got to write something that is amazing . ''
