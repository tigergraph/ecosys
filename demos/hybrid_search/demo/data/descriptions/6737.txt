The first three minutes of this track consist of Drake spitting rhymes which include a declaration that Cash Money executives Birdman -LRB- `` Stunna '' -RRB- and Lil Wayne -LRB- `` Weezy '' -RRB- are his role models along with Haffa and Jordan .
Rick Ross takes the last verse reminding the listeners that `` you only live once . ''
Drake is not afraid to show his feelings in his music , which is unusual for rappers , -LRB- check out `` Marvin 's Room '' and `` Miss Me '' -RRB- .
As a consequence some critics have accused him of being too soft .
We hear him rejecting his alleged sensitive persona on this track , saying that `` showing emotion do n't ever mean I 'm a pussy . ''
Drake raps , `` I 'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix '' on this song .
Some have interpreted the lyric as the Canadian MC staking a claim for himself as the rap Jimi Hendrix or Bob Marley .
Drake told UK newspaper The Guardian that 's not strictly what he was saying .
`` I did n't really say I was the rap Hendrix or Marley , I said I was the descendant , '' he explained .
`` Because I feel like that 's what I want to be for this generation : iconic .
That 's the purpose I want to serve on this earth .
I want my words to be remembered in 10 , 15 years . ''
Drake and Ross have paired up on several previous occasions , including DJ Khaled 's `` I 'm On One '' and Rozay 's own `` Aston Martin Music . ''
The Toronto MC told MTV News : `` If I have chemistry with anyone in the studio it 's Ross .
We want to make the same music .
It 's definitely a very good experience . ''
Jay-Z collaborator Just Blaze provides the beat mixing a gospel choir and trademark stomping drums .
