This is the oldest song on Jake Bugg 's eponymous debut album , having written it when he was 15 and still at school .
`` Against all the other songs the lyrics are a little bit na√Øve , the song itself is pretty simple , classic chord structure , '' he admitted .
`` The label were quite happy to have it on the record and I thought ` oh great , oldest song . ' ''
