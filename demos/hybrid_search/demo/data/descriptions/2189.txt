This is the second track on Christian post hardcore band The Devil Wears Prada 's fourth studio album Dead Throne .
It starts with the lyric , `` back for the fourth time around , '' and unsurprisingly the band thought about opening the album with this song .
Eventually they decided to let it follow the title track , and act as a bridge into the rest of the record .
Guitarist Chris Rubey -LRB- from Alternative Press -RRB- : `` The one singing part in it Adam -LSB- Dutkiewicz , producer -RSB- made a whole bunch better .
That part used to be really different - I think Adam actually took a few breakdowns out of the song just to keep everything flowing . ''
Frontman Mike Hrancia told Alternative Press : `` I wrote it a little bit differently than I 've ever wrote anything else ; -LSB- I wrote it -RSB- like a poem and then put it to the song rather than building off the song too much . ''
