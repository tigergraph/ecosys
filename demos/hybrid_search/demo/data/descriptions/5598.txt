This song by Canadian rapper Drake was released on September 10 , 2011 on his October 's Very Own blog .
It was helmed by Noah `` 40 '' Shebib , who in addition to being the main producer of Drake 's Take Care album , has also worked on songs by Nicki Minaj , Lil Wayne , and Trey Songz .
This finishes with a snatch of a 1979 Bob Marley interview , in which the reggae legend explains how some people are `` still searching for that truth . ''
The song finds Drake feeling out of place with all the fame and money his success has brought him and worried about the effect this has on his relationships .
Drizzy reveals he has n't forgotten about the girls that he knew before he became well known .
`` Tell me who did I leave behind ? ''
he raps .
`` You think I 'm so caught up in where I am right now / But believe I remember it all . ''
The song is titled after a famous strip club in Drake 's home city of Toronto , and we hear him calling out the real names of some of its working girls .
