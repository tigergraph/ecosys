Cancer Bats frontman Liam Cormier -LRB- from Terrorizer magazine -RRB- : '' ` New World Alliance ' is probably our most black metal song we 've ever written , so it 's fitting that I wanted to make it proper evil -LSB- laughs -RSB- .
But the whole idea with ` New World Alliance ' is a rethinking of rules and laws , a bit of an extension on the no gods , no masters idea .
For lots of us involved in metal and hardcore or in punk rock it 's like , we do n't fit in to the normal ideas , especially where a lot of us are n't involved in religion in any way .
So it 's looking at , well if we 're not involved in this then why are we involved in Christian laws , I should n't even say that specifically , but just like a rethinking of everything , so that was that idea , that there 's a bigger group of us that all have this mindset , that are all thinking progressively .
Rethinking our way in the world . ''
