This sultry piano ballad is the first single from Canadian singer-songwriter Feist 's album Metals .
It was debuted on August 12 , 2011 on the US radio station KBCO .
Metals was recorded live over a period of two and a half weeks inside a house on the Northern California coast .
`` We tried to record The Reminder live , but there ended up being a lot of overdubs and enhancing , '' Feist told Rolling Stone .
`` This time , we had the arrangements completely done by the time we were in front of microphones . ''
This tale of romantic frustration finds Feist lamenting an incommunicative lover .
`` You 're an instrumental tune , '' she tells him , which is quite a poke coming from such a gifted singer .
Feist won the 2012 Polaris Music Prize for Metals .
The award goes to the best Canadian album of the year based on , `` artistic merit without regard to genre , sales history or label affiliation . ''
