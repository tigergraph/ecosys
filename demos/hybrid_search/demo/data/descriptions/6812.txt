Ryan O'Neal of Sleeping at Last wrote this from the perspective of the character Edward for the movie The Twilight Saga : Breaking Down -- Part 1 .
The song appears twice in the film , first as an instrumental when Bella walks down the aisle at her wedding , then later in a honeymoon love scene .
In our January , 2012 interview with O'Neal , he explained how it came together : `` About six months ago I had the idea enter my mind after being a fan of the previous Twilight soundtrack , because they always have such incredible music on there , that would n't it be absurd and crazy if I just tried to write something for this upcoming film as far as the soundtrack .
So I watched all three films back to back for the first time and after watching and doing a little homework to try to figure out what 's coming up next in the next film and what 's going to develop with the relationships , I sat down and tried to write my first song for a movie.And after about a week -- I think it only took me about four or five days to put the song together -- I sent the song over as just a blind submission .
I did n't hear anything back , and then a few months after that I got that incredible call that they told me that it made it into the final cut of the film .
So needless to say , it was a good day . ''
O'Neal says he 's thrilled with how the song was used in the film .
`` I had known they were going to use it for about a month or so prior to the release of the film , '' he said .
`` So I had n't seen it for that entire month , and I had the incredible privilege of being invited to the premiere in Hollywood .
So I got to see it for the first time in that incredible setting .
And I 'm so so excited with where they used it .
They actually used it two times in very nice scenes .
`` Ryan has worked on music for TV shows before , and usually delivers an instrumental track of any song he creates as well as a vocals-only version and the regular mix .
