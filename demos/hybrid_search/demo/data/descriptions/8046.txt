Dave Gahan is a former heroin addict , whose several brushes with death , earned him the nickname , `` The Cat . ''
Now happily living with his third wife , Jennifer , their daughter , Stella Rose and Jennifer 's son , Jimmy , the Depeche Mode vocalist has finally found some peace in his life .
This song finds him reflecting on mortality not induced by self-destructive instincts .
He told Q magazine : `` Every verse ending with ` Is this the end ?
Should this be the end ? '
It was seeing myself for the first time .
The wondering ` why , why , why ?
What 's it all about ? '
I 'm going to do something useful with it , try to be the best father and husband I can be ... and the best musician .
I wrote myself back into life . ''
