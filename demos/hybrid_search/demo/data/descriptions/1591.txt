This song was released by the Welsh Alternative Rock band The Joy Formidable as a teaser single prior to the release of their sophomore album .
Despite sharing a title with the long player , the song was not planned to appear on its track listing .
Frontwoman Ritzy Bryan explained the meaning of the title to NME : `` Wolff 's Law is a medical term , but we 've added a bit of poetic license to it , and made it our own .
We were fascinated by the wolf as a symbol of nature , and that 's another inspiration on the record .
We like the ambiguity of the wolf in different cultures ; sometimes it 's a foreboding animal , sometimes it 's a compassionate one .
Nature is a huge metaphor for everything - for the way that we live , for harmony , for balance , for cruelty . ''
