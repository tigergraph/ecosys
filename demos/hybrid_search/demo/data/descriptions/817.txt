This ballad was the first love song between a man and a woman that the Christian rock band Skillet recorded .
Lead vocalist John Cooper explained the meaning to CMusicWeb.com : `` It is not just about loving a person , it is about the fact that love conquers all , '' he said .
`` When things seem really hard , the idea that love can take a little more .
I think that goes with the message of Collide , that we are Christians and we do need to learn how to balance the fact that we are humans and we do make mistakes with the fact that we have been redeemed and God has a new life for us that we need to learn how to live . ''
