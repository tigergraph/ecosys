On this song , along with the rest of the album , Browne was backed by his long-time band of Kevin McCormick -LRB- bass -RRB- , Mark Goldenberg -LRB- guitars -RRB- , Mauricio `` Fritz '' Lewak -LRB- drums -RRB- and Jeff Young -LRB- keyboards and backing vocals -RRB- .
All four band members got a songwriting credit on this track .
Browne told American Songwriter magazine how the songs for Time The Conqueror evolved , in particular this track , which questions the Bush administration 's response to Hurricane Katrina .
He revealed : `` One of the quests I went on was how to make a bunch of songs not really based on the way I play and to make use of these great players .
Every night , I 'd come in here after everyone had left and get a verse or two .
I would n't know how to end it , so I 'd pull up what I 'd done originally ... and I do n't know how these guys got days of sessions listening to me sing nonsense .
Amazingly .
I think it frees them up , 'cause they probably tune out and play more emotionally .
They might have half the song written , then a whole section they do n't know what 's coming .
` Where Were You ' was basically written based on a guitar lick .
Whole movements of that song came from a session where Jeff -LRB- Young -RRB- just started playing beautiful stuff .
I key them off and go where the music wants to go . ''
