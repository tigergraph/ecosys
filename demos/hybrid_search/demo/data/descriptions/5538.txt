Having survived heavy alcohol and drug issues , Filter singer Richard Patrick can relate to others going through the same difficulties .
This song was inspired by one particular girl who reached out to him .
He told Artist Direct : `` I 'm in this secret society of people who stay sober off of alcohol and drugs and because of that I know a lot of other people who give up .
The give up is killing themselves .
They ca n't drink themselves to death , which is what they want to do .
They end up killing themselves .
It 's literally burning someone 's house down and burning their lives up . ''
`` I used to know this lady , '' he continued , `` who would put cigarettes out on her legs and make these patterns there .
She 'd scar them , and it was like crop circles .
There were all of these burns in a geometrical shape like crop circles .
That 's taking it to another whole level .
Having survived my drug years , you meet a lot of amazing people who hopefully get their s -- t together but most of them do n't .
They hurt themselves .
They find relief in pain .
It 's heavy duty s -- t. ''
