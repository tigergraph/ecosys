Ron Sexsmith is a Canadian singer-songwriter , who despite having a number of famous admirers that have covered his songs , including Elvis Costello , Elton John , Paul McCartney , and Sheryl Crow , has always been slightly under the radar of the mainstream .
Georgian-born British singer-songwriter Katie Melua covered this song about a realist 's bid for optimism in 2011 for her Secret Symphony album .
A second version of this song featuring duet vocals from Coldplay 's Chris Martin appears as a bonus track on Cobblestone Runaway .
Sexsmith was unaware of the recording until he heard it on the disc .
He explained to UK newspaper , The Guardian January 17 , 2013 : `` I was touring when my record was being mixed in LA and the producer asked Chris to replace my piano part , because I 'm a terrible piano player .
That 's how it started , but he ended up singing on the record .
I was n't around at the time so they could n't ask my permission .
It sort of bothered me that they sent me this CD with ` Gold in Them Hills Remix ' written on it and I did n't even know who it was singing .
I thought it was me at first , but it did n't sound like me .
It took me a while to get anyone on the phone to explain who it was .
Obviously the record company were desperate for me to release it once they knew it had Chris Martin on it . ''
