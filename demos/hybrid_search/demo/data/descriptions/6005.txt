When the of Mice & Men vocalist sat down to write a song to vent his emotions , it became a dedication to her memory , as well as a statement of how he hoped to make her proud , by living his life as an inspiration for others .
Austin told Kerrang !
magazine : `` I wrote it for myself as a way to vent and express myself .
It 's made me want to write more stuff like that , to open up and be more real .
Reading all the letters I get from fans , I 've gone through a lot of that same stuff : bullying , depressive thoughts , not having any friends and living in an orphanage .
These are things I went through and I can help others .
I can be like a big brother , a mentor or guide . ''
