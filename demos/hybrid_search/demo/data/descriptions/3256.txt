Allen had had this song in his back pocket for some time before finally finding a home for it on Thank You Camellia .
He said regarding its meaning : `` Love is the one thing that I know and the one thing I do n't know .
I know how to love .
I know how to love my family , I know how to love my wife , I know how to love my fans .
But I 'm also still trying to learn how to do those things well .
I 'm still not where I want to be .
`` Allen added : '' ` Teach Me How Love Goes ' is definitely about feeling that you do n't know what you 're doing and wanting a guidebook on how to make it work . ''
Allen played all of the instruments , save for drums and some electric guitar , on this track .
