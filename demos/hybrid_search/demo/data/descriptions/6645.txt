This is the song credited with giving `` Reggae '' its name .
When asked about the song , Toots said : `` People tell me that , but when I did it , I did n't know .
There was the beat in Jamaica , reggae was played long before I started singing .
And there was a slang , like a nickname for someone who do n't dress properly - like if you are barefoot , people would call you ` streggae . '
They say `` hey , that guy is streggae , do n't talk to him . ''
If a girl do n't dress properly , like do n't have on any top , they call her streggae .
So one morning , one Tuesday morning , we just said ` Let 's go along and do some reggae . '
Those days we 'd just make stuff up , anything .
A bird flies around the corner , you write a song about it .
So we just say ` Do the reggay , do the reggay , ' and that 's it .
A few words , y' know ?
And nobody paid it any mind until it started to go all over the world .
I saw it in the Guinness Book of Records .
So I thank God that I did something good , and I did n't even plan it . ''
Toots and the Maytals were an influential band whose songs have been covered by the Clash and the Specials .
The group was featured in Reggae 's greatest breakthrough event - The Harder They Come , the 1972 film that became an international sensation .
