Stooshe are Karis Anderson , Courtney Rumbold and Alex Buggs , a South London Pop/R & B trio , two of whom were discovered in a queue for Topshop .
This song finds them singing of their friendship and mutual bond .
Karis explained to The Daily Mail : `` It 's about when you admit to yourself that you have that crazy side and you 're telling your partner - you 're kind of threatening them a bit . ''
`` You 've just got a lot of confidence about you , '' she continued , `` and you 're just saying , `` Do n't annoy me , do n't get on the wrong side of me , because you do n't want to see that side '' .
It 's about us three being best friends and having each other 's backs . ''
