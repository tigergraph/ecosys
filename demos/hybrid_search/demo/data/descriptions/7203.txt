Phoenix frontman Thomas Mars explained to the Washington DC free newspaper Express that this song was inspired by the English rock band , The Clash .
Said Mars : `` It was a fantasy this song .
There is a Clash song called ` Death Or Glory ' and this song - I did n't know it - but I love The Clash so much , -LSB- but -RSB- this song would n't play on my -LSB- copy -RSB- of London Calling .
We imagined this song , so it started as a Clash song then we 'd make it our own . ''
