This ironic celebration of getting truly wasted is the inverse of the band 's biggest hit `` Monster 's '' grim depiction of a lad 's night out on a Saturday night .
Vocalist and bass player Rob Hawkins admitted in the album 's publicity materials : `` There 's some irony to it , but at the end of the day it is quite fun to get smashed .
I think it 's got that inkling that it 's probably not the best thing to do , it 's about the self-destruction of it , almost celebrating that . ''
