`` That 's one of the dumbest songs I 've ever written '' pretty well sums up what singer Steve Adams has to say about this song .
`` It 's just about being away with the band , thinking about gettin ' it on with your lady when you get home .
There 's nothing more to it than that . ''
Having started out as a British-band-doing-American-country , the Broken Family Band is forever evolving .
They dropped the American accent after the first few releases , and have segued into heavier sounding stuff .
It keeps things interesting , explains singer Steve Adams .
`` We 've turned into a rock and roll band ... I think we were a lot quieter for a long time .
But we 're quite heavy now .
So it 's all quite exciting.I think that , because there are outside pressures that bands have , they want people to buy their music , and they want people like them .
And I think we want people to like us , and we want them to buy our music , but it 's always been far more important that we keep ourselves interested .
We just want to make nice pop music and stuff , but we do n't want to get bored playing the same songs over and over again .
And so the boredom is very low .
Once you 've made a record , you do n't want to make the same record .
We made the same record maybe two or three times , and then realized that we want to evolve . ''
