This upbeat track mixes Gospel , Soul and some Prince R&B .
Hayley Williams told The Sun : `` Taylor -LRB- York -RRB- and I came up with the melody and I thought about Prince too .
Then it got layered with more groove and funk and all the cool elements .
The next thing I know there 's a Gospel choir in the studio and we have that track .
It 's been so liberating to write this record . ''
The song was written by Williams as a sarcastic jab at her unwillingness to grow up after moving to Los Angeles to record the Paramore album .
She found herself away from her loved ones feeling completely out of her depth .
`` I was on my own for the first time ever and it weirded me out , '' she told Radio.com .
`` I felt like I was going kicking and screaming on my own .
But it 's funny , because I needed that .
I needed a change of perspective to know I could do a lot of things on my own . ''
Williams wrote the song after realizing there was no good reason to complain .
`` Here I am , sitting here whining about my life that 's not really all that bad , '' she explained .
`` My life is actually awesome and just because I 'm a little uncomfortable , like why am I making such a big deal out of this and not making more of this opportunity ? ''
The song finds Paramore moving away from their rock roots to a more dance pop feel .
Bassist Jeremy Davis told The Guardian that the band had their largely teenage fan base in mind .
`` After we started writing weird stuff like ` Ai n't It Fun , ' we got nervous , '' he said .
`` But that was a comfort .
We 've grown and we do n't like the same music we liked , so why would -LSB- our fans -RSB- not ?
That idea kept us pushing ourselves . ''
The song 's music video was originally directed by Jonathan Desbiens .
better known as Jodeb , However , the group was not happy with where the clip was headed and ultimately , made the decision to pull it .
The visual was eventually re-shot by Sophia Peer -LRB- The National 's `` Sea Of Love '' -RRB- and finds the trio attempting to break the most world records within a music video -LRB- that being a world record in and of itself -RRB- .
They include : `` Most Vinyl Records Broken in One Minute '' `` Fastest Time to Smash 30 Clocks with Guitars '' `` Most Feathers Caught in 30 Seconds '' `` Fastest Time to Run Backwards Holding Stuffed Animals While Blindfolded for 30 Feet '' `` Longest Time Spinning Record on Finger '' `` Longest scream while riding in a convertible .
