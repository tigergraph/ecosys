This was one of the first songs Madina Lake worked on for World War III .
Frontman Nathan Leone told Rock Sound magazine : `` Mateo -LSB- Camargo , guitar -RSB- always comes up with these tapping bits that I feel define a lot of our songs .
We tracked a lot of this one in a house we rented in Florida when we were recording The Dresden Codex EP . ''
Nathan Leone explained the song 's meaning to Rock Sound magazine : `` At the time I think the screws were starting to come loose , so psychologically we were all over the place .
This song is about wondering in a positive way as opposed to a negative one .
If you constantly wonder what could go wrong , something will .
If you wonder what you could become or achieve or fulfill , that will manifest as well . ''
