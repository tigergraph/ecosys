`` Valle Mistico '' is the name of the temporary studio created in a mountain villa at the outskirts of Tepoztl√°n , Mexico where Oberst recorded the album .
MTV News asked Oberst who played the horns on this instrumental track .
He replied : `` This guy Ruben , who worked at Valle Mistico .
He used to blow this conch , like a seashell horn .
So every night there was this mountain that was above the place and he would go up there and blow it .
We became really great friends with him .
It was just a sound we were used to hearing .
And you can really hear the sound of the night .
'Cause you blow it and it reverberates off the mountainside ... it 's such a pleasant sound , I wanted to capture it . ''
