This graveside eulogy was written by West for his mother Donda West , who died at the age of 58 in November 2007 following complications from cosmetic surgery .
Donda was an academic who raised Kanye alone after her marriage broke up when he was three and was a constant presence at his side .
West said at the album 's listening party : `` The irony for me , someone who has talked about so many labels - Louis Vuitton this , Benz that , this girl look good , I 'm not going out with you if you do n't look good - the irony , for me to lose the most important person to Hollywood . ''
On this song West borrows melodies and some lyrics from the Tears for Fears song `` Memories Fade , '' which was a track on their 1983 album The Hurting .
A music video was filmed for a remixed version of this song , featuring added tribal drums and synths .
It was directed by Nabil Elderkin who also helmed the clips for West 's `` Paranoid '' and `` Welcome to Heatbreak '' West does not feature , instead it depicts a beautiful girl running through a dark forest as grim , hooded creatures chase after her .
Elderkin told MTV News that due to the personal nature of this song , the video is n't as intense as their previous work together .
`` It 's pretty minimalistic , '' he said .
`` It 's slow and very visual .
I just wanted to catch the vibe of the song and not get too literal .
Because the lyrics are very close to Kanye and go much deeper than the video goes , obviously hearing the song you know it 's very emotional . ''
West previously paid tribute to his mother on 2005 's `` Hey Mama . ''
The 808s & Heartbreak CD insert includes a fold-out photo of West with his mother .
