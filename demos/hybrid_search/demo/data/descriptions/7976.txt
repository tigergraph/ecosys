Bassist Tom Fleming takes lead vocals on this track .
He told Drowned in Sound : `` The intention with this was for it to sound as if it were played once , which it more or less was .
Written in an hour or so one evening with what was to hand -LRB- a # 20 guitar and a laptop mic -RRB- and dependent upon feel .
We 're big R&B listeners to be honest , and this was played as slow as we dared . ''
The song was originally called `` Inner Fires , '' but re-titled as the band , `` wanted something more definite . ''
Fleming explained the song 's meaning to Drowned In Sound : `` It 's a song for someone doing profound things just by existing and getting on with their life , a portrait of many friends . ''
