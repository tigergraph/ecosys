Conor J. O'Brien , the singer of Irish band Villagers , told The Sun August 6 , 2010 : `` I see The Pact as a type of gospel song more than anything else .
It 's an homage to a god-figure of some sort , human or otherwise , and the multi-faceted nature of this type of worship.It 's a song about power and impulse and it is important to me that it connects with the listener on his or her own terms .
I know what it means to me but I ca n't possibly explain that to you .
I can only sing the song . ''
