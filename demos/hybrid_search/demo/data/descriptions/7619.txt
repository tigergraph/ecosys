Released on the Indie band Matt Pond PA 's sixth album , this song is called Halloween , apparently because the protagonist gets angry and sets the main setting on fire .
However , the last Halloween on a Saturday night was in 1998 , and the next in 2009 .
The underlying interpretation is the protagonist and his girlfriend just go with the flow and crowd .
As he realizes that he lost his individuality , and that the crowd they hang out with are shallow and stupid -LRB- `` You do n't need a thought to look good '' -RRB- , he becomes very angry and tears apart the place .
-LRB- thanks , Alex - Rio Rancho , NM -RRB-
