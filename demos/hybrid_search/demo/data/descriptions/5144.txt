Blake explained the song 's meaning to Pigeons and Planes : `` It 's not necessarily a human thing , as in , it 's not relating to me or to a person .
I decided to call the album Overgrown after I made that song the title track , and that lyric is just part of a poem called ` Overgrown , ' so that 's what I 'm singing about .
It 's the post-apocalyptic state that you find yourself in mentally .
`` Blake is referring to Emily Dickinson 's Charlotte Bronte-inspired poem `` All overgrown by cunning moss , '' which is about the impermanence of life , a sentiment that also runs through Overgrown .
Overgrown won the 2013 Barclaycard Mercury Prize , which is an annual award for the best album from the UK and Ireland .
The judges called it `` an inventive , poetic and poignant album of great beauty . ''
`` Well , I lost a bet ... on the other hand , I should thank a couple of people ... '' Blake said upon receiving the honor .
The song 's main sentiment of wanting to be around , still , `` when everything 's overgrown '' was inspired by an encounter Blake had with Joni Mitchell .
The Canadian legend came to see the English singer at a US gig and gave him some wise advise afterwards about building a long-lasting career .
The songs on Overgrown were loosely themed around a single sleepless day .
