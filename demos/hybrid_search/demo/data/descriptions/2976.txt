In our interview , The Royal Concept told us this track is `` about a girl that struggles to achieve climax more than once during a passionate night . ''
The official music video follows The Royal Concept as they are kidnapped and forced to perform by a throng of female fans .
The band spoke to us about the video shoot : `` We got beat up by five cute girls the whole day , terrible really .
The most fun part was meeting Phoenix , that was really cool .
She 's probably the best makeup artist in the world .
Earlier that day she did Beyonc√© and then she did us . ''
Following a huge amount of support from music bloggers , `` Gim me Twice '' became a viral smash , topping The Hype Machine 's chart in June 2012 .
The Royal Concept told us why they think the song was so successful : `` We think it 's a great catchy song with a nice mix of guitar driven riffs in an electronic atmosphere .
Strong singable melodies are always a winning concept and we 're fighting to bring it back in today 's music . ''
