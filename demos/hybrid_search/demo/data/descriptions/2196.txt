This love song is about finding the person you were meant to be with and have been waiting for all your life .
The hook line , `` I knew I loved you before I met you '' is a somewhat awkward lyric , but many listeners found it deeply moving and the song became very popular at weddings .
This song almost did n't make it onto the Affirmation album .
When Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones of Savage Garden presented their songs for the album to their record producers , they were told that the album would n't be as big a hit as their debut album if they did n't have a `` Truly Madly Deeply '' on it .
So Darren and Daniel went and wrote this song .
