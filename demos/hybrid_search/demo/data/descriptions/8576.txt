This cut from the Country music duo Steel Magnolia 's self-titled debut album was written by Keith Urban .
`` That was actually brought to us by -LSB- Big Machine VP of A&R -RSB- Allison Jones , '' Steel Magnolia 's Josh Jones told The Boot .
`` We did n't know we had a void on the record until we recorded that song and realized we needed some of that boogie woogie in there , and it 's so cool that Keith Urban wrote it . ''
Urban did n't originally write this as a duet , but Steel Magnolia soon put their stamp on it .
`` Lyrically when you first hear it , you do n't really think that it could be a duet , '' Josh 's partner Meghan Linsey told The Boot , `` but we put our spin on it .
It is so sassy .
It 's one of my favorite tracks on the record .
It 's one that you can jam out in the car to . ''
Only avid Urban fans will be familiar with the tune .
`` It 's something off of his old record from 1997 with his first band The Ranch , '' Josh explained to The Boot .
`` Keith kept tracking me down wherever I 'd be .
I 'd be eating dinner , and he 'd show up .
He 'd show up with a work tape , and he 'd say , ` Hey , listen to this .
Please record this !
My family needs to eat . '
-LSB- laughs -RSB- But honestly , it came through -LSB- our artists-and-repertoire person at the label -RSB- .
She said , ` Oh , this would be a cool song . '
And we agreed .
We thought it was pretty cool , and we worked it out as a duo . ''
