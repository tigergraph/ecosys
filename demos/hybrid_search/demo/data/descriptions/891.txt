Graham Nash : -LRB- from Rolling Stone magazine -RRB- : `` We wrote that with a lot of alliteration .
The first time we recorded it was here in New York City at the Record Plant in December 1968 .
Paul Rothchild was helping us with the record .
We did two songs : ` You Do n't Have to Cry ' and ` Helplessly Hoping . ' ''
