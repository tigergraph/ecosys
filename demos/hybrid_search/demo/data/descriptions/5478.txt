A rare U2 song with no Bono -LRB- at least on vocals , he wrote the lyrics -RRB- , Johnny Cash sang lead on this one .
U2 started writing it for Cash when they found out he was coming to Dublin for a show .
They decided to keep it for themselves with Cash as guest performer .
A song that describes a man 's travels and search for redemption , Bono said it was `` one of the best things we 've ever done , and I 'm not even on it . ''
U2 recorded this as if they were a bad lounge act .
It was the last song on Zooropa , since they wanted to end the album with something that would not be taken too seriously .
About a minute after this ends on the CD version of Zooropa , an alarm goes off .
The working title was `` Johnny Cash On The Moon . ''
The only time U2 played this live was at the 2005 tribute concert for Johnny Cash - Bono did the vocals .
The concert was called I Walk the Line : A Night for Johnny Cash .
