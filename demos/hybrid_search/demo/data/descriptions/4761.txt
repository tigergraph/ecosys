Credited to Tom Rutley , Neal Schon and Mike Shrieve , `` Eternal Caravan Of Reincarnation '' is the title track of the 4th studio album by Santana , and was the start of a whole new ball game .
According to Simon Leng in Soul Sacrifice : The Santana Story , this downtempo instrumental ` takes shape , with the sounds of double bass , phased piano and jazz guitar -LSB- reminding -RSB- the listener ... of Pharaoh Sanders ' `` Astral Travelling '' ' .
He appears to have forgotten the crickets ; running to 4 minutes 25 seconds , this track and album can not be appreciated at a first or probably even a tenth listening .
`` Eternal Caravan Of Reincarnation '' segues into the guitar instrumental `` Waves Within '' .
