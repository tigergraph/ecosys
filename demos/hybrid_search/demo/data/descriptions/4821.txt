This lovelorn piano ballad was penned by bassist Shonna Tucker , who also contributes a lead vocal and trades gentle harmonies with Patterson Hood on this song .
Tucker also wrote '' -LRB- It 's Gon na Be -RRB- I Told You So '' on The Big To-Do and three tracks on 2008 's Brighter Than Creation 's Dark .
`` We always knew she had that in her , '' Patterson said , delighted with the emergence of another strong songwriter in the band .
`` It was never a secret .
She was writing songs all along .
But watching it come out has been a really amazing thing to behold . ''
