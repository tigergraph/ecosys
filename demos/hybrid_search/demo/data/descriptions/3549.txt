This is the lead single from Frank Turner 's fifth album , Tape Deck Heart , which the English singer-songwriter recorded in Burbank , California , with American producer and engineer Rich Costey -LRB- My Chemical Romance , Muse , Jane 's Addiction -RRB- .
`` It 's an autobiographical song ... -LSB- but -RSB- it 's not a song about getting better , but it 's about the act of realizing you have a problem , and you need to sort your life out , '' Turner explained to MTV News .
`` It came to me in one of those moments of clarity in the middle of a long , solid drunk where you go ` What am I doing ?
Who are these people ? ' ''
The song starts with the lyric , `` Blacking in and out in a strange flat in east London .
Somebody I do n't really know just gave me something . ''
This is one of several references to seeking solace at the bottom of a bottle on Tape Deck Heart .
Turner admitted to NME that having entered his thirties , he saw the need to cut down on his boozing .
`` I 'm 31 now , '' he said , `` and I think there 's a no-man 's land between where you 're drinking and partying the whole time , and actually having serious problems .
And as you get older , that no-man 's land shrinks a bit .
`` In the last year I 've been trying to cut down on my Baccanalian habits , '' he continued , because it 's not good for you , and you end up in bad places . ''
Turner revealed to MTV News that the lyric , `` On the night we met .
You said ` Well , darling , let 's make a deal .
If anybody ever asks us .
Let 's just say that we met in jail ' '' came from a real-world relationship .
The old-school album artwork was done by Heather Ann Law , a tattoo artist from Florida who came to Turner 's shows and gave him some drawings she 'd done for some of his songs .
He told NME : `` I love her work and it fit for her come up with ideas for the cover .
I 'm really into tattoo culture and style generally . ''
