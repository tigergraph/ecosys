This is a track from G-Unit rapper Lloyd Banks ' third studio album , The Hunger For More 2 .
The song features Kanye West , Fabolous , Ryan Leslie and Swizz Beatz .
The track was originally scheduled to just feature Banks and Fabolous but soon expanded to a multiple collaboration .
`` That was one of the last joints I recorded for my album , '' Banks explained .
`` Originally it was me and Fab , then I got Kanye , then Swizz was in the city and so was Ryan .
The difference from that track being me and Fab and having Kanye was 24 hours , '' he added .
The beat was provided by producer Cardiak .
It was the first placement on a major artist 's track for the New Jersey native , and was an unexpected break for him .
`` I was n't even really shopping the beat like that , '' Cardiak admitted to The Boombox .
`` It was just sitting in my computer .
I did n't really expect for Banks to pick it like that but when he picked it , I did n't think the song was gon na come out the way that it was . ''
West 's contribution came about after the `` Stronger '' rapper complimented Banks ' abilities on Twitter , calling the G-Unit MC one of the most underrated artists in hip-hop .
`` The whole Kanye thing happened , it was shortly after the tweet that he wrote , the comment he made about me being underrated and should be in everybody 's top five , '' Banks told MTV News .
`` We read that statement , and it kind of took off on its own .
I definitely appreciated that .
Just for him to say that opens up the eyes that have been watching him -LSB- to me -RSB- .
And from there , it made sense to go into the studio with him .
Shortly after that , we went into the studio . ''
Banks and Kanye West also collaborated on the latter 's track , `` Christian Dior Denim Flow . ''
