`` Tymps '' in this case is short for `` timpani , '' which are kettle drums .
Fiona wrote the song on a portable Yamaha electric keyboard she had at home , which is something she rarely does , since most of her writing is on a piano .
The song had a timpani sound , which is how it got the title.Brian Kehew , who co-produced the Extraordinary Machine album , told us : `` It was a temporary title for it called ` Tymps , ' because that 's how we referenced the song .
Then it eventually got subtitled ` Sick in the Head , ' because that was one of the funny lyrics in it .
But she wrote it that way and it inspired her to create something different than she might have done on the piano . ''
The Extraordinary Machine album was leaked on the internet months before its official release .
`` Tymps '' did not appear on the leaked version .
In this song , Fiona looks back on some poor decisions she made regarding a love interest , and wonders if it was love or insanity that was responsible for her actions .
Like she did on another track from the album - `` Red Red Red '' - she sings in colors on this one : `` The red is n't the red we painted , it 's just rust . ''
