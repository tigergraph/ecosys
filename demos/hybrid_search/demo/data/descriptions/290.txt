This song begins with the distant sound of recorders over an ambient soundscape before Andrew VanWyngarden starts musing about how , `` all beginnings are an end .
In the blackness , there 's a light , '' as the tune gradually gathers pace .
The vocalist told Digital Spy : `` For ' I Love You Too , Death ' , -LSB- the editing process -RSB- was at times tenuous as to what the song was .
We added all these elements and we wanted it to sound like a train that starts off slow and keeps going . ''
