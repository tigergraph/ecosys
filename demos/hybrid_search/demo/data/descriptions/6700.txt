This is the first single from American singer-songwriter Lissie 's debut album , Catching A Tiger .
The song was written after the break-up of a long-term relationship .
`` I 'd have these great dreams , like everything was fine and we were together and life was happy and everything 's good , '' Lissie recalled to MTV News .
`` That would be the place where I could see him and I would wake up from that dream and it was like the reality is that we 're not together anymore and I need to get over it and move on with my life - which is gon na take some time but it 's going to hurt until it stops hurting , and that 's all right too . ''
