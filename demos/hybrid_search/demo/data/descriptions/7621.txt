This is about a guy telling his ex that he regrets letting her current man take her from him .
He adds that at the time he told her he did n't like the way he looked at her , but she claimed it was just his imagination - does she believe him now ?
This was the first release and title track from Wayne 's sophomore CD .
There was a five-year gap between his first two albums due to the company now called Universal Music Group acquiring DreamWorks Nashville and Wayne asking to be released from his DreamWorks contract .
It was worth the wait as it became Wayne 's first # 1 and sixth entry on the Hot Country Songs chart .
After spending one week at # 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart , this song was replaced at the top by Brad Paisley 's `` Waitin ' on a Woman '' before returning to # 1 .
The last time this happened was in December 2005 when Dierks Bentley 's `` Come A Little Closer '' topped the charts for two weeks , before being replaced by Joe Nicholas ' `` Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off '' for one week .
Dierks Bentley then returned to # 1 for a third non-consecutive week .
New-Mexico based singer-songwriter Joe West , Dave Pahanish and Tim Johnson wrote this .
Wayne told the Associated Press that the first time he heard the song , `` the melody to me was captivating , almost hypnotic . ''
He added : `` Just from listening to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of songs , I knew this one was different from anything else . ''
This was the first Country # 1 and fourth chart entry for the independent Valory imprint .
All four entries were by artists whose first names start with the letter `` J '' -LRB- Jewel -LRB- twice -RRB- , Justin Moore and Jimmy Wayne . -RRB-
