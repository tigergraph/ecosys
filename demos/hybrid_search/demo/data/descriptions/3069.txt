Glenn Hughes -LRB- bass/vocals -RRB- told Musicradar.com the story of this tongue-in-cheek raunch 'n' roll tune : `` I was at the movies with a friend of mine , and during the previews I just started singing , ` Smokestack woman ... ' I knew it was silly , but I said to my friend , ` Hey , Mick and Keith and the Young brothers in AC/DC have been doing this s -- t for years .
You ca n't tell me it wo n't work . '
The whole song has a swagger to it .
I wanted to have a bit of a romp on this one , and there you go -- we 're havin ' a romp .
It 's not this serious , we 're - gonna-wake-the-dead kind of thing .
It 's a rockin ' tune . ''
The song features guitarist Joe Bonamassa playing the theremin , a bizarre electronic instrument which was famously used by The Beach Boys on `` Good Vibrations '' and also on Star Trek .
