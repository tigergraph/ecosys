Lead singer Tom Higgenson told Rolling Stone magazine that as he wrote the album whilst in a long-term relationship , he found himself writing with more of a self-proclaimed duality .
He explained : `` On the past records I 've put the blame on the girl , and I think with this record I 'm turning a lot more to myself .
The song ` Serious Mistake ' goes ` I 've made a serious mistake , I hope it 's not too late to fix the heart I 'm breaking . ' ''
