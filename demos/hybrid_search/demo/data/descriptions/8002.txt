Joshua Scott Jones , who is the male half of Steel Magnolia , told us about how they came up with this song .
Said Jones : `` We were working with one of our friends , this pop producer from Los Angeles .
He 's originally from New York .
His name 's Tommy Hendriksen .
And he had a friend in town named Chiama Eze .
They were looking for records for Jason Castro , who was releasing a record , and Tommy had an in , he said he could get that song to Jason and thought that that would be cool if we wrote a song and tried to pitch him the song .
And so we wrote that originally thinking Jason Castro , the guy off American Idol with the dreadlocks .
And then we ended up playing it for -LRB- our label -RRB- Big Machine Records and they 're like , ` You should just put that on the record , we 'll do what we can with it . '
And that was a fun one , too.That one is the most country-sounding , I think , of all the songs on this album .
The lyrics , music , everything .
The whole pink slip , my car broke down , my dog died , and all those things . ''
