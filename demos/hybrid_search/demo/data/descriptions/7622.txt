The Airborne Toxic Event 's debut self-titled album is full of lyrics which involve a rejection of happiness and this song is the most obvious example .
In an interview with This is Fake DIY , songwriter Mikel Jollett was asked if this was a conscious decision .
He replied : `` No , these are just the songs that swung .
We wrote about 100 songs for the record and 10 of them made it on because they were the ones that swung the most !
We just liked them .
It was n't a conscious decision .
Your point about it being a lot about rejection is what I was going through .
In The Road by Cormac McCarthy , which I just read , there 's a great line in there that says , `` The right dreams for a man in peril were dreams of peril '' .
You ca n't write about things honestly if you 're trying to dress them up , so that 's what I was going through at the time .
I 'm not really going through that now .
Someday I 'd love to write a record about falling love with a beautiful woman and having a wonderful family and children .
I think from the outside a lot of this stuff looks a lot more intentional than it is .
I can understand that .
You sit down to write and this is what happens .
For me , there was no intent to it and we 're not really trying to make a statement .
I 'm not trying to make a statement .
They 're just songs about feelings . ''
