Dobson penned this song with Andrea Wasse , the vocalist of the Ontario group The Weekend , and with American guitarist David Lichens , who also produced the track .
She explained the song 's meaning to Telus : `` This was a fun song to do too !
It 's a song about ... If you 're man enough ... you can be my man , so I can be your lady .
It 's also a song about confidence , what sort of man you need and how he has to take care of you . ''
