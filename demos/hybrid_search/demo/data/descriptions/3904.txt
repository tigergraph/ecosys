Meghan Linsey originally met Joshua Scott Jones when she was working at a Nashville karaoke bar .
Not only did they become a couple but they went on to become the successful Country music duo , Steel Magnolia .
This break-up tune was the first song the pair wrote together .
When we spoke with Joshua Scott Jones , he told us , `` It 's kind of ironic the first song that we wrote together and it 's a breakup song .
We keep everything out there .
We do n't really lie about anything . ''
There was a third writer on this song : their friend Julie Moriva .
Says Jones : `` Julie has been a writer and she 'd been coming back and forth to Nashville for probably 7 or 8 years .
At that point she 'd already been coming for 3 or 4 years .
We stayed up late writing that song .
I mean , way into the a.m. And we wanted to finish it that night , and we finished it all in one session .
But I think it was an 8 hour project .
Then for about a year and a half after that we were re-working it to where it finally got to where it is now .
So it 's one of the songs that it took a long time to really get the formula for it down , how we wanted to sing it.And as far as where I sing , where Meghan sings , and then just whether it was going to be verse/chorus , verse/chorus/bridge , I think we played around with that for a long time .
But I remember when we first started writing it , Julie had said , ` Well , this does n't sound like a country song .
I want it to be a country song . '
And that was a little argument that we had gotten into about the song , just because it had this rap feel to it .
The meter of it in the beginning , it 's kind of fast and off the beaten path .
But it worked out well . ''
