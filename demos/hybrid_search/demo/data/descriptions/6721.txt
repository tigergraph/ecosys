Singer Yannis Philippakis told NME the song 's lyrics , `` are from a father to a son .
It 's like Icarus .
The father ca n't help the son .
`` Yannis is referencing the classic Greek myth of Icarus ' flight , whereby having been imprisoned by King Minos and exiled to the great Labyrinth , Deadallus and his teenage son Icarus escape by building wings made of wax and feathers and flying away on them .
Deadallus warns his son not to go too high , but he ignores his father 's advice , goes too close to the Sun and his wings melt , sending him plummeting to his death in the sea .
