It 's not often the sound of a wildebeest makes it into a major recording artist 's album but you can hear one on Paul Simon 's So Beautiful Or So What disc .
The American singer-songwriter explained to Mojo magazine : `` In that song ` Rewrite , ' the ` doom ' sound on the end of the ` doodle-e-doom ' part throughout the track is a wildebeest we recorded on a family holiday .
In the studio it was all ` More wildebeest ! '
` Too much wildebeest ! ' ''
You dig the whistling bit at the end ?
Another Paul Simon song , that features whistling is `` Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard . ''
