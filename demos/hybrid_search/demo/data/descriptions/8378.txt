This song is about how Tila likes a guy and all she wants is to have sex with him , but she 's warning him if he does anything , he 's in trouble -LRB- `` If you ever hurt me , i 'll F *** in kill you ! '' -RRB- .
She tends to notice throughout the song that there are other girls he likes -LRB- `` What ?
who 're talkin to ? '' -RRB-
or that he 's not even paying attention to the fact that she 's there or that she really wants to get in bed with him -LRB- `` Hold up !
do you see me laughing ? '' -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , Lilly - East meadow , NY -RRB- Tila Tequila set a record for the most MySpace views , and in 2007 was given her own reality show on MTV : A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila , the twist being the both men and women would compete for the affections of the bisexual singer .
