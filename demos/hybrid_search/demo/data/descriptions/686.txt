This is the opening track of experimental rock band The Flaming Lips ' twelfth studio album , Embryonic .
The closest thing on the record to a traditional pop song , the band 's frontman Wayne Coyne described it to The Daily MailSeptember 18 , 2009 as , `` The first take of a traditional jam . ''
Coyne explained this song in the album 's press notes : `` This was our first successful attempt at merging a low-fi distortion jam with hi-fi computer overdubs .
This was the first in a series of lyrics inspired by repeated viewings of the controversial film The Night Porter -LRB- made in 1974 by the radical Italian director Liliana Cavani -RRB- .
Its themes of submission and obsessions and cruelty and pleasure really put the zap on my sleep-deprived head . ''
The roots of Embryonic can be traced to Summer 2008 , when multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd and Coyne set up gear in the Oklahoma City house that Drozd was selling and started jamming .
This was the first fruit from their sessions .
Coyne told Billboard magazine : `` I think with this there was an element of accidentally stumbling upon more spontaneous sort of freak-out stuff .
We were sitting at -LRB- multi-instrumentalist -RRB- Steven 's house and we just started out having these freak-out jam sessions where he 'd play drums and I 'd play bass and we just would sort of do freaky stuff .
Some of those recordings , even though they 're not recorded very well , really had a spontaneity about them that we probably would n't have purposely done .
So we just went with some of that and use those as sort of the bedrock of what we 'd do later on with overdubs and lyrics and stuff like that .
It sounds very exciting . ''
Embryonic debuted on the Billboard 200 at # 8 , giving The Flaming Lips their first ever Top 10 album .
