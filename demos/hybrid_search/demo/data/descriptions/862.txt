The 23-year-old Avicii wrote this song with the 71-year-old songwriter Mac Davis , who is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame thanks to his Elvis Presley compositions , which include `` In The Ghetto '' and `` A Little Less Conversation . ''
Davis lent a timeless story to the song , comparing his unconditional love for a girl to a drug addiction .
It 's a storyline that has permeated many hits , including '80s classics by Robert Palmer and Huey Lewis & the News .
Davis said that he wrote this song the way he always does : sitting for hours with his guitar on his lap .
He said in Rolling Stone that Avicii is like `` a mad scientist , with his computer and his focus , '' adding , `` I may be an old fart , but I love EDM . ''
The song 's Bonnie and Clyde-themed music video stars Swedish actresses Hedda Stiernstedt and Madeleine Martin as two ill-fated lovers who embark on a wild cross-country crime spree .
The clip was filmed in December 2013 over the course of six days .
Audra Mae is the vocalist on this track - she can also be heard on another cut from the album , `` Long Road to Hell . ''
Mae is an Oklahoma singer/songwriter who also performed on `` Beekeeper 's Daughter '' by The All-American Rejects .
