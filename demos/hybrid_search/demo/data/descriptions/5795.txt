The first song that Suzanne Vega ever wrote was a Country tune written to her younger brother Matthew .
She told American Songwriter magazine : `` It was about my brother and how I would always love him even though he got into fights .
I liked the song ` Liverpool Lullaby ' as sung by Judy Collins and I wanted the song to have that tough tone to it .
It took me three years to finish it .
I finished it at the age of 14 . ''
Just under 40 years after writing the song , it finally found its way onto a record when Vega recorded it for Close Up Vol .
4 : Songs Of Family , the fourth of a series of discs where she re-imagines her own songbook in stripped down arrangements .
Speaking with the New York Press , Vega described this as a `` fake country song . ''
`` I started writing songs when I was 14 , '' she said .
`` The first songs were like fantasy songs .
The first song I wrote was a song called ` Brother Mine , ' and I was 14 , and it was kind of like a fake country song .
I 've never lived in the country , but I was really into country music for about a couple of months . ''
`` It was like a fantasy of being a country girl getting new shoes for my brother , '' she continued .
`` There was this line about I have to go into town and get them Friday night , that sort of thing .
We were right in the middle of Manhattan , so ... Those were my first songs .
They were n't about anything real , they were about this fantastic life of escape .
And there were similar songs about running away , traveling , being on the road , which I had never been .
Those first songs had a big element of fantasy . ''
