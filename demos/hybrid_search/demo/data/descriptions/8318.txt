A number of snooty rock critics expressed their surprise that former Smiths member Johnny Marr played harmonica on this pop song .
Here 's Marr 's explanation to Uncut magazine as to what possessed him to work with the chart-friendly five-piece : `` I was working with -LRB- Girls Aloud producer -RRB- Brian Higgins on a Pet Shop Boys record , and I let it slip that I liked the guitars on a couple of Girls Aloud 's early singles .
So he got me in a headlock , took me from behind and , before I knew it , I had a harmonica in my mouth .
No , I loved doing it .
I am evangelical about pop music .
The idea that pop is crass and commercial is an olf-fashioned rockist conceit linked to the whole `` Disco sucks '' campaign .
I always saw The Smiths as a pop group .
Sparks , Roxy Music , Bowie , Sweet all made great pop-45s .
I 've always held on to the nobility and aspirations of pop , and what it can be . ''
Marr also played guitar on another Girls Aloud track , `` Rolling Back the Rivers in Time . ''
