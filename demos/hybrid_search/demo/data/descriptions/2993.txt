This murder ballad was inspired by the early 1990s TV serial drama Twin Peaks .
Frontman Charlie Fink explained to The Sun : `` I absolutely love Twin Peaks .
It 's my favourite thing that 's ever existed .
I wanted the song to feel like a character from it - the girl is based on Laura Palmer .
This is the first time I 've written from the third person lyrically .
It 's a challenge to make that shift but , it 's a great way to write because it opens up so much . ''
