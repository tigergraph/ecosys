Nashville songwriter Danny Myrick is a former member of Country music band Western Flyer .
He co-penned Jason Aldean 's `` She 's Country , '' which was the most-played Country song of 2009 .
This uses `` truck '' in place of a far less radio-friendly word .
`` It 's having some fun with words , yeah , '' McGraw told LA Times .
`` But the thing about this record is that I just wanted to go into the studio and cut a track that tore your face off - like , ` Damn , that is rockin ' . ' ''
Asked to describe the song by Roughstock , Janson said , `` It 's just hillbilly , boot-stompin ' music . ''
He added : `` What I wanted to write , what I envisioned we 'd write that day and that 's what came out , you know ?
I hope it takes people back to the beginnings of McGraw , between ` Indian Outlaw ' and ` Real Good Man . ' ''
McGraw debuted the song during his Brothers of the Sun tour with Kenny Chesney in the summer of 2012 .
`` We have been unbelievably excited about ` Truck Yeah ' since the first show of the summer when we played it live for the first time , '' he said .
The song debuted at # 22 on the country chart , earning McGraw his highest solo chart debut of his career to date .
Chris Janson told the story of the song to Roughstock : `` I double booked the write with LoCash Cowboys and Danny Myrick .
I had the appointment with Danny on the books and then LoCash called and said ` we 're free tomorrow , wan na write ? '
And I said , ` Sure , but I 'm also writing with Danny , so can we all do it together ? '
They already knew Danny so they said , ` Sure ' and we got all together and decided to work together and when I pulled up in my truck , Preston came up to me and said , ` Man I love your truck ! '
I said the alternative to ` Truck Yeah ' as you can imagine and he stopped me there and said , ` No , no , no man , truck yeah ! '
and I was like ` Done ! '
-LRB- meaning that it felt like a song ideal -RRB- .
So we sat there and I started doing this boot stompin ' melody on the guitar and Preston and Chris -LRB- Lucas -RRB- broke out their laptops and started out writing stuff and Danny came up with the initial intro lick and I started rapping off words like ` Little Wayne pumping on my iPod ' and everybody started filling in words from there and it was absolutely everybody 's idea at the same time , it was really cool . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Chris Hicky and as well as McGraw , it also features the singer 's Country Strong co-star Garrett Hedlund as one of his trucking buddies .
