A very positive song , Hatebreed lead singer Jamey Jasta wrote `` I Will Be Heard '' about the drive to overcome obstacles and achieve your goals .
`` It 's a good message , and that made me feel just amazing that people believed in my lyrics and the music that I was writing , '' he told us .
`` Because I 'm not really an accomplished guitar player .
I actually wrote that song on a guitar that my father gave to me when he was in the hospital , and I wrote it on that acoustic guitar .
I thought , ` Man , if this sounds heavy on acoustic , it 's going to be crushing when we really play it . ' ''
The video was directed by Marc Webb , who would go on to direct the films 500 Days of Summer and The Amazing Spider-Man .
This is the kind of song you write while fighting to achieve your dreams , and that 's exactly what Hatebreed was doing when they wrote it .
They released their first album in 1997 on the independent label Victory Records , then spent the next five years touring and refining their sound .
When they recorded demos for their Perseverance album and shopped them around , they got a very enthusiastic response thanks to this song .
Suddenly in high demand , they got to pick amongst several offers , choosing Universal Records as their label .
According to Jamey Jasta , they interviewed at least 10 different producers to work on the album , ultimately deciding on Matt Hyde , who had produced Porno For Pyros and Slayer .
`` It changed my life forever , that song , '' Jasta told us .
`` It took us all over the world .
We had n't had a record out in four or five years , so it reinvigorated our fan base .
People really related to it .
Everywhere I went there were people with the words tattooed on their bodies . ''
This was used in the 2002 Vin Diesel movie xXx .
