Daryl Hall of Hall & Oates recorded fresh vocals for this song , which were based on the duo 's 1984 hit `` Out Of Touch . ''
Nero 's Dan Stephens explained to MTV News how they reached out to Hall for this track .
`` A guy that works in the office just next to our studio , he produced -LSB- Hall 's -RSB- most-recent album , '' he said .
`` So , he said , ` Oh , I know Daryl .
I can sort that out for you .
He 'd probably be up for singing some new material on the track as well .
` So , back and forth through emails , he agreed that he would re-sing that passage and sing a whole brand-new fresh chorus for the track .
So , it 's all original Daryl Hall material , which is amazing !
And he still just sounds so great .
It 's incredible . ''
The song also contains an arpeggio sample from 1980 's Italian dance act Kano 's `` Another Life . ''
In 2004 dance act Uniting Nations had a Europe-wide hit with a song also titled `` Out of Touch , '' which again heavily sampled the Hall & Oates number .
The video is based on the TV show Miami Vice , with a graphic look and style similar to the iconic '80s program .
