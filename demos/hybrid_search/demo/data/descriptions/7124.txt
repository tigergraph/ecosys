This ballad was originally recorded by Lemar on his 2003 debut album , Dedicated .
In 2010 the British R&B singer re-recorded the track with boy band JLS for his greatest hits compilation The Hits .
Lemar explained why to Blues and Soul magazine : `` When I was on tour around The Reason , JLS were my opening support act - and they obviously put on a good show , as well as bringing loads of fans with them !
So I 'd spoken to the guys quite a few times - we 're on the same record-label , we have the same management company ... Plus I 'd known Marvin -LRB- Humes -RRB- a little bit before he actually formed JLS with Oritse -LRB- Williams -RRB- .
So we just thought ` Why not get on a TRACK together ? '
... So I spoke to the record-label and they suggested ` What About Love ' - which was on my first album - because , though we never put it out as a single , it 's a song that always goes down a storm whenever we 're on tour .
You know , it 's like everyone 's waiting for that moment - they all sing along , phones in the air ... So we just decided to go into the studio together to give the song a new twist and breathe some new life into it .
And we had a lotta fun doing it ! ''
