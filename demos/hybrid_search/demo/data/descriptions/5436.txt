This song features producer DJ Premier , who is best known for being one half of the Gang Starr duo .
Ludacris told MTV News about his collaboration with the hip hop legend : `` I 've been wanting to do it for so long .
He 's really quick to make a beat , man .
We was vibing .
We made about two or three tracks , and I told him which one I absolutely loved .
When you hear this s -- t - , it 's gon na remind you of Gang Starr .
It 's some Gang Starr-reminiscent s -- t. I do n't think Premier veers away from his sound , but this one could have been on a Gang Starr album .
That 's almost what I was looking for -LSB- sonically -RSB- . ''
