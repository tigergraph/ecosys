Ozzy 's bass player Bob Daisley wrote this song .
Said Daisley : `` I really wrote that one about myself .
When I was 16 I had my first nervous breakdown and it really f -- ed me up .
I was a sensitive kid and I have always been a sensitive person .
I suppose you have to be sensitive being in the arts .
I wrote the words about myself .
Quite often we have problems and we are our own worst enemies and that is why ` Enemies fill up the pages one by one in the diary .
Are they me ? '
I am my own worst enemy .
The other thing was that Randy had the rough idea for the song ` Diary Of A Madman ' and I came up with title .
I wrote all of the lyrics as well on the album .
Ozzy would come and go from rehearsals .
One day he came in and we played him ` Diary Of A Madman ' and because it had funny timing he could n't get his head around .
He said , ` Who the f -- k do you think I am ?
Frank Zappa ! '
We said , ` You sing in this part but you do n't sing here .
This timing goes like this etc. ' He started to like it when he got his head around but at first he was like , ` This is not for me ' . ''
-LRB- thanks , Terry - Belleville , Canada -RRB- Supposedly , Ozzy had a hard time coping with the unusual time signature in this song , which was composed by Randy Rhoads and Bob Daisley .
According to Daisley , Ozzy 's comment was , `` I 'm not $ % ^ & ing Frank Zappa , you know . ''
-LRB- thanks , David - Lilburn , GA -RRB- The little boy on the album cover is Ozzy 's son Louis from his first marriage .
