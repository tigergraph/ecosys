Chad Gilbert -LRB- guitar -RRB- told Kerrang !
magazine February 16 , 2008 : `` I remember wanting to use the term it ` blow it ' because my girlfriend at the time would always say , ` You 're going to blow it ! '
Lyrically , it was at a point of time in our band when certain members were second-guessing what we were doing because their priorities in life were different .
So this is about someone who 's going to screw something up and they 're going to regret it . ''
Steve Klein -LRB- guitar -RRB- added : `` We 're trying to give this person a life belt before they go off the sinking ship . ''
