This is the title track of the Liverpool pop/rock group 's sixth studio album .
It was their first release for 10 years , during which Lightning Seeds main man Ian Broudie concentrated on production for other bands such as The Coral and The Zutons .
Broudie wrote this song after several close family members died in relatively quick succession , including his civil rights lawyer brother Robert , who threw himself from the bell tower of Liverpool Cathedral in October 2006 .
Broudie told The Daily Telegraph May 27 , 2009 : `` I do n't think I sat down and thought I 'm gon na do a record about all of this , it was just about writing songs and getting that release .
I was thinking about the idea of what 's depression and what 's sadness , and is there a difference ?
I wrote ` Four Winds ' as a poem and then set it to music .
I 've never done that before . ''
