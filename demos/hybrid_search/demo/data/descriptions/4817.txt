Vocalist M Shadows told Kerrang !
magazine : `` We wanted to make an evil requiem instead of all those ones about , ` Oh Lord , save me . '
This one is about the dark lord coming to save you and resurrecting Hell to do it .
It 's a crazy , out-of-control piece of music with orchestras , strings and all sorts of madness . ''
Guitarist Synyster Gates told MusicRadar.com that they wanted this song 's foundation , `` to be a metal band 's approach to classical orchestration . ''
He explained : `` Matt 's vocal is more like a lead violin part , and when my guitar chugs underneath the riff , it 's almost like what low brass would do .
We layered each element very carefully , and the result is one of the more cinematic tracks on the record . ''
