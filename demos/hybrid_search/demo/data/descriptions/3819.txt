Wild Belle are a sibling rock duo comprised of Barrington , Illinois natives Elliot and Natalie Bergman .
Multi-instrumentalist Eliot Bergman started his musical career with the Jazz-inspired Funk and Afrobeat combo Nomo , who formed when Elliot was attending the University of Michigan .
Singer-songwriter Natalie Bergman initially explored a career as a solo act after attending the Berklee College of Music in Boston .
She toured with Nomo off and on while developing her own songs but the pair only began focusing on writing together exclusively as Wild Belle in 2011 .
The duo attracted interest from a number of labels after releasing a self-financed , self-produced album and playing several major US festivals to massive acclaim .
They eventually signed a three-album deal with Columbia Records .
This breezy slice of Synth-Pop about unrequited , lifelong love was originally released as a single in Wild Belle 's independent days .
Columbia re-released the track and enlisted `` We Found Love '' video director , Melina Matsoukas , to helm the promo .
Matsoukas explained to Rolling Stone the clip is `` a story about unrequited love and how with age we do n't necessarily mature As a child all we want is love and attention and that story never grows old , it just takes a different form as we age .
So it 's not so much about all men are boys but just all of us are forever young .
Old habits never die . ''
