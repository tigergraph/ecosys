This song reflects a relationship that the lead singer of the band , Johnny Galvatron , once had .
It talks about how he stood her up and then she went to Tokyo as a sort of return favor .
It pretty much describes his efforts to get her back , but , alas , `` he did not make it to the gate on time '' and ` he ran every single light '' -LRB- running a red light -RRB- .
-LRB- thanks , Josh - Craigmore , Australia -RRB-
