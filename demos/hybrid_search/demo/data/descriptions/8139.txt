This is one of three songs on Let England Shake that was prompted by the 1915 battle for Gallipoli , a grotesquely bungled attempt to seize Constantinople , which wiped out much of the Australian and New Zealand Army .
Harvey told NME : `` Battleship Hill was the place of a particularly bloody battlefield .
The ` scent of rhyme ' was because it grows wild in Gallipoli . ''
Harvey told The Sun about this song : `` Throughout the songs on the album , nature plays a great role .
I 'd chosen to look at a lot of ancient folk songs from all over the world .
Songs from hundreds of years ago passed down the line in Cambodia , Ireland , Vietnam , Russia .
And a theme which comes through in all these countries ' music is your relationship to the land .
The lyric : ' I hear the wind say , cruel nature has won again , ' captures that feeling .
No matter what happens to us , nature will always be there .
Which is comforting but also quite brutal . ''
Harvey concludes `` cruel nature has won again '' on this song and the beauty of the music deliberately offsets the bleakness of the scenes on the record .
`` I was very aware of not wanting to sing the words in a way that was going to add more weight to them , '' Harvey explained to NME , `` because I felt like I would fall into sounding too dogmatic or self-important . ''
