This is a duet with No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stefani .
It was Stefani 's second appearance in a row on a duet , after being featured in Moby 's remix of `` South Side . ''
Stefani was looking to get her solo career going , and her label boss at Interscope Records , Jimmy Iovine , put her together with producer Dr. Dre to work on this track .
Under Iovine 's guidance , Stefani did very well with and without No Doubt : her 2004 debut solo album Love.Angel.Music.Baby was a huge hit .
At the time , however , Eve was much better known as a solo artist .
After this successful collaboration , Eve returned the favor by appearing on the Gwen Stefani song `` Rich Girl '' from her Love Angel Music Baby album .
-LRB- thanks , Jimoh - The Bronx , NY -RRB- Won the 2001 Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration .
This beat-driven track was written by four producers : Dr. Dre -LRB- credited as Andre Young -RRB- , Stevie J , Scott Storch and Mike Elizondo .
Dr. Dre produced the song , which was an interesting pairing considering his history with Eve .
He had originally signed Eve to his Aftermath label , then dropped her after 8 months , with the lady rapper releasing her # 1 charting debut album Let There Be Eve ... Ruff Ryders ' First Lady on the Ruff Ryders label .
While recording this song , Dre and Eve constantly argued in the studio and still managed to produce a hit .
Won the 2001 MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video .
Moby 's `` South Side , '' which also featured Stefani , won the award for Best Male Video .
