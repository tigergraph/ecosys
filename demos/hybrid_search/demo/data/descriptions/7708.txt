Brooklyn rapper Fabolous has carved out a long and successful career by combining melodic mainstream singles with a series of mixtapes , which have enabled him to maintain his relationship with his street fanbase .
This song was one of his most commercial releases , which Fabolous later admitted to The Boombox he originally had mixed feelings about .
Said the New York rapper : `` At the time , I thought it was a little too soft to be released as a single .
It was more female friendly , but the crazy part is it became one of those joints that guys would dedicate to their chicks .
`` He added : `` In real life not everybody is hardcore and gangsta all day .
We have girlfriends , too .
Maybe ` Into You ' was n't a song that you rolled around bumping in your hood , but when you were with your lady you turned it up in the car .
I 've also heard plenty of dudes in jail say that they 've dedicated a song or two of mines to their ladies .
So I think those female friendly songs can work on that level . ''
The song samples the chorus of Tamia 's song `` So Into You '' from her self-titled 1998 album , which itself samples the Commodores ' track , `` Say Yeah . ''
Whilst R&B artist Tamia features on the single version , Ashanti is the vocalist on the rendering found on the album .
American actress and former fashion model K.D. Aubert played Fabolous ' love interest in the song 's music video .
