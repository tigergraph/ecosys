This song is about any ex-girlfriend that you still wake up in the middle of the night thinking about and wondering if she 's thinking about you too .
-LRB- thanks , Mark - Miami , FL -RRB- A lyric in the first verse was originally going to be `` And I wonder if you give him better bl-w jobs than the ones I got from you , '' but lead singer Tomas Costanza changed it to appease his ex-girlfriend , who was afraid her mom would hear it .
The lyric was changed to `` And I wonder if you give him more excuses . ''
-LRB- thanks , Kim - Birmingham , England -RRB- This was featured on the soundtrack for the Disney movie Freaky Friday , starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan .
-LRB- thanks , Natasha - Bethany , OK -RRB-
