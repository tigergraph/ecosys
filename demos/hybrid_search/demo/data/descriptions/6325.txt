This Country rocker was penned by Jake Owen with 2012 ACM Songwriter of the Year Dallas Davidson and Jimmy Ritchey , the producer of Owen 's first two albums .
The nostalgic summertime song was released as the third single from Barefoot Blue Jean Night on May 21 , 2012 .
The song was inspired by one particular real life summer relationship .
`` It 's a true song for me , '' explained Owen .
`` It 's the one on the record that I wrote , just about my hometown and the way that girls and their families would come to town during the summer and then they 'd leave three months later , go back up North , start school .
They would always leave , and there 's this one girl in particular , I just remember I never saw her again . ''
Owen grew up in Vero Beach , Florida and he refers to his hometown 's main drag when he sings , `` Well she kissed my lips .
Down on Ocean Drive . ''
Davidson told Taste of Country how Owen recalled to him and Ritchey that every summer girls would flock to Vero Beach .
They would hook up with the local guys , before returning home at the end of the season .
`` It 's about falling in love and having a summer love and never seeing them again , '' Davidson explained .
`` Jake lived it .
We all had summer flings , and Jake especially because he literally was a local .
All the girls would come in and fall in love with a local .
Then they leave and are never to be seen again . ''
The song 's music video was the fourth Owen clip in a row to be directed by Mason Dixon .
The singer told Billboard magazine : `` I 've created a relationship with him like Kenny Chesney has with Shaun Silva .
I 'll go to dinner with him , and say this is my vision for the song .
I wanted to go back home for a Florida vibe , and bring that summertime feel . ''
