Nashville songwriter John Scott Sherrill wrote this .
Says Sherrill : `` That 's one of my favorite records ever .
For some reason these really personal songs end up getting cut , and that was another one of them for me .
That very girl , the Wild And Blue girl , she finally said it was over .
I was just driving all night long , just like it says in the song , and actually started writing it in the middle of that drive .
I did n't finish it or anything , but the idea : there I was holding on to nothing but the steering wheel .
I got the brief kind of glimmer into the song right there .
I really was driving away .
I did n't know where I was going and I did n't care .
I just knew I had to get out of town .
I ended up at a little state park called Montgomery Bell State Park , and I just sort of slept in my car down there . ''
Peter Wolf recorded this with Mick Jagger singing the harmony parts .
Their version appears on Wolf 's 2002 album Sleepless .
