This is the title track of Californian indie rock band Cold War Kids ' third studio album .
Frontman Nathan Willett explained in publicity materials regarding the inspiration for the record : `` I got home from tour and realized I was married .
All my friends had either jumped in the deep end of a relationship or had drowned .
When did things get so serious ?
We fought growing up but the wild nights and free-for-all caught up with us .
Some people got out in time and others had permanent damage .
For this record , I wrote about the joys and failures of commitment all around me '' .
Willett told Artist Direct about the laying down of the Mine Is Yours album : `` We had been recording for several weeks , doing all the music and I was doing sketches of lyrics the whole time .
In between that time and finishing the record in LA , I was finishing the lyrics .
It took a long time , as I wanted to do something more focused and more cohesive , where the songs reflected each other , so the theme of relationships and commitment became the thread of the record .
In order to get ` there , ' it was me , in the studio , at the desk , treating it like a real job , where I was in there for hours , writing , then scrapping stuff , then starting over .
All the lyrics came out of that type of session , which is different for us .
We are usually much more visceral and employed quicker ways to do it before .
This was more thought out and you can see the songs have a similar theme . ''
