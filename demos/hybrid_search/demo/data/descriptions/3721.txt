The song is named after the main character in Victor Hugo 's The Hunchback of Notre Dame .
In one part of the book , Quasimodo was chained inside the cathedral while the gypsy Esmerelda was to be burned at the stake .
Quasimodo breaks these chains , and rescues the gypsy .

Sometimes I get pictures of people when I 'm writing .
I look at this person like some kid at school who does n't look as cool as the rest of the kids and does n't act as cool .
There 's a group of kids that comes along and try to make him what they want him to be and do things he does n't want to do .
He goes along with it cause he 's afraid .
But by the chorus , he 's breaking out of that , saying , `` There goes my pain / there goes my chains / did you see them falling / Because this feeling / that has no meaning / there goes the world / off of my shoulders . ''
So it ends hopefully . ''
