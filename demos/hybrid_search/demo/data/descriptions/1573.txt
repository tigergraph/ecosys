After Billy Joel attempted suicide back in 1970 -LRB- by drinking furniture polish -RRB- , it failed to kill him and he wrote the song `` Tomorrow is Today '' as the suicide note .
Later on he was asked if he could write a song that could help prevent teenage suicide .
Joel agreed , but the first recording concerned him because it had a dreary and depressing tone that he thought might give troubled teens the wrong message .
As result he created a new version with bouncy , joyous beats and lyrics about personal forgiveness and optimism for life .
During the song , Joel noticeably hesitates with one of the verse lines and laughs after it .
He decided to keep this mistake in the recorded version because it seemed to be proof of his personal fallibility , as in the line `` You probably do n't want to hear advice from someone else - But I would n't be telling you if I had n't been there myself . ''
-LRB- thanks , Landon - Winchester , OH , for above 2 -RRB-
