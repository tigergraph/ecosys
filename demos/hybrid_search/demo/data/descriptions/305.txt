This song depicts the flight from Greenville , South Carolina to Baton Rouge , Louisiana ; the plane was carrying the band Lynyrd Skynyrd and crashed that night .
Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant fell asleep during this flight and was sleeping on the floor when the emergency began .
He was quickly awoken and put into a seat and strapped in .
The airplane was supposed to be repaired when the crew got to Baton Rouge , where a mechanic from Texas was meeting them .
Both engines were failing during flight and the loss of gasoline was too much for the plane to make it to Baton Rouge .
Once the crew realized they could n't make it to Baton Rouge , they turned the plane around to reach the nearest airport .
Shortly after the plane turned around , it ran out of gas , the engines turned off , and the controls were no longer operable for controlling the decent of the plane .
