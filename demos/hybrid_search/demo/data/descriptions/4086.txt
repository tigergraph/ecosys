The narrator of this song is coming from a desperate place .
CMT News asked Martina McBride how she deals with singing such a dramatic song .
She replied : `` Usually I have to get to know the character in the song .
Either I immediately relate to the character in the song , or I have to find that person .
That song in particular was a little hard for me because the woman in the song is very desperate and very vulnerable , so it took me a while to wrap my head around exactly where she 's coming from emotionally . ''
