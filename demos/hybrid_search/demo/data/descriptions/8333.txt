The `` Murder Bar '' is a place called Roar Of The Crowd , which is located in Haskell , New Jersey , across the street from the hotel where Sevendust was staying when they made the album .
The folks at Architekt Music Studios , where the band recorded in nearby Butler , New Jersey , tell us that it 's actually a great place - popular with locals - and that nobody has been killed there , nor do murderers frequent the joint .
The place does look a little shady from the outside , however , and Sevendust started calling it the `` Murder Bar '' after hearing an offhand comment along the lines of , `` you might get murdered if you go in there . ''
Intrigued , the band stopped in and found it very inviting .
In our interview with lead singer Lajon Witherspoon , he explained that meeting the locals helped energize the band creatively , as they picked up different themes and ideas along the way .
One barfly who stood out was Carl , the janitor of the local high school for the past 40 years .
`` I looked forward to talking to him and hearing his story , telling me about these kids that he remembers that are here behind him drinking at the bar that are 40 years old now , '' Said Witherspoon .
`` It was like from out of a movie . ''
