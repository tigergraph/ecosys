In 1970 Dylan was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music from Princeton University .
Not only did he accept it , he turned up at the ceremony to receive it and then decided to put down the whole event and snub academia in this song .
It has been suggested -LRB- Tim Riley - A Dylan Commentary -RRB- that he only went through with the farce so he could write a song about it .
-LRB- thanks , Ed - Perth , Australia -RRB- This has nothing to do with Dylan 's song but here 's a bit of trivia connected with West 's novel .
One of the book 's characters , the hopelessly clumsy `` everyman , '' is named Homer Simpson .
Although it has been suggested that The Simpsons creator Matt Groening called his famous thick-headed , beer-swilling cartoon creation after the character of the same name in The Day of the Locust , he actually named him after his own father .
The song title is a reference to the 1939 novel by American author Nathanel West -LRB- 1903-40 -RRB- , The Day of the Locust .
West had worked for a time in Hollywood as a scriptwriter and the book explores the seamy underside of the American movie industry .
The novel 's title is thought to be a biblical allusion to certain passages in the Old Testament such as in the Book of Joel 2 : 25 , `` I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten . ''
