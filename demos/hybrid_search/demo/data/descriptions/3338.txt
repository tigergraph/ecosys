This is the first single from Staind vocalist Aaron Lewis 's debut solo Country album , The Road .
`` It 's definitely proof that I can write a happy song , '' Lewis told OC Weekly .
`` It was a straightforward and easy story to tell . ''
The song 's music video futures a live performance and was directed by Jim Wright .
This song finds Lewis singing about digging for clams and fishing striped bass with his daughters .
`` If we catch a keeper we throw it on the grill , '' he told Reuters .
`` The beauty of the adventure that I 'm on now is I can write songs about stuff like that .
I could never bring a song like that to the table for Staind .
`` Lewis added that writing `` Endless Summer '' was a `` refreshing and a nice change '' from his metal past .
`` I remember having a big smile on my face the whole time I was writing it , '' he said .
`` In the past , what 's usually coming up for lyrics is not smiley material .
The song wrote itself in 10 minutes . ''
Lewis first got into Country music as a child thanks to his grandfather .
Kid Rock later revived his interest after Staind toured with him in 1999 .
The frontman told OC Weekly that he wrote each track for his first solo set while crossing the country with Staind .
`` It was n't like I was writing a song for today 's country radio .
I was n't limiting myself , '' he noted .
`` If a song came out , it would come out and go on the record . ''
Lewis explained why this song is so upbeat .
`` It 's just the story of the weekend trips I take with my wife and my daughters to our little beach cottage , '' he said .
`` It 's hard not to be happy when I think about that . ''
