Jackson came up with this song while he was staying in Moscow during his Dangerous tour .
He looked outside his hotel room and saw the crowds of fans who were enthralled with him , yet did n't know him in any meaningful sense of the word .
He recalled a sea of faces of fans chanting and screaming , yet he felt all alone , as if he were the last person on the planet .
That and the cold , bleak urban Moscow setting came together and inspired this song .
In November of 2009 , Brad Buxer , A fellow music producer , had announced in the French Magazine Black and White that the 1993 video game Sonic The Hedgehog 3 nearly featured a soundtrack made by Jackson .
Michael was displeased with the video game system 's sound quality , and Buxer said that `` He did not want to be associated with a product that devalued his music '' and had his name removed from the final product .
It was confirmed by Buxer within the magazine that he and Michael had worked on chords for the video game 's end soundtrack , which sounds suspiciously similar to `` Stranger in Moscow . ''
-LRB- thanks , Logan - Troy , MT -RRB- This was the last song by Jackson to make an impact on the charts .
The lyrics tell a great deal about his life and state of mind at the time , but his career was slipping by the time this song came out , and it has since been overshadowed by his legal problems .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA , for above 2 -RRB-
