Scarborough is a small town on the coast of England .
The `` Scarborough Fair '' was a popular gathering in Medieval times , attracting traders and entertainers from all over the country .
The fair lasted 45 days and started every August 15th .
In the 1600s , mineral waters were found in Scarborough and it became a resort town .
Today , Scarborough is a quiet town with a rich history .
-LRB- thanks , Sheryl - Seal Rock , OR -RRB- Paul Simon learned about this song when he was on tour in England , where he heard a version by a popular Folk singer named Martin Carthy .
When Carthy heard Simon & Garfunkel 's rendition , he accused Simon of stealing his arrangement .
Carthy and Simon did not speak until 2000 , when Simon asked Carthy to perform this with him at a show in London .
Carthy put his differences aside and did the show.Martin Carthy learned the song from a Ewan MacColl songbook , and had recorded it on his first album , according to BBC 's Patrick Hamphries.Paul Simon admitted to the July 2011 edition of Mojo magazine : `` The version I was playing was definitely what I could remember of Martin 's version , but he did n't teach it to me .
Really , it was just naivety on my part that we did n't credit it as his arrangement of a traditional tune .
I did n't know you had to do that .
Then later on , Martin 's publisher contacted me and we made a pretty substantial monetary settlement that he was supposed to split with Martin , But unbeknown to me , Martin got nothing . ''
This was not released as a single until 1968 , when it was used in the Dustin Hoffman movie The Graduate .
It is on the soundtrack .
`` Scarborough Fair '' and `` Canticle '' are 2 songs that are sung simultaneously to create this piece .
The first and last verses are `` Scarborough Fair , '' but lines from `` Canticle '' alternate after the first line of the other verses , so `` On the side of a hill in a deep forest green '' and `` Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground '' are from `` Canticle . ''
With its implicit anti-Vietnam War message , this was used in The Wonder Years TV series in a scene where Kevin Arnold embraces Winnie Cooper while the song was played at the end of the episode .
In the show , Winnie 's brother had been killed in Vietnam .
-LRB- thanks , Marciliano - Fortaleza , Brazil -RRB- In Medieval England , this became a popular folk song as Bards would sing it when they traveled from town to town .
The author of the song is unknown , and many different versions exist .
The traditional version has many more lyrics .
The lyrics are about a man trying to attain his true love .
In Medieval times , the herbs mentioned in the song represented virtues that were important to the lyrics .
Parsley was comfort , sage was strength , rosemary was love , and thyme was courage .
Before Simon & Garfunkel got to it , Bob Dylan used the lines , `` Remember me to one who lives there , she once was a true love of mine '' in his 1963 song `` Girl From The North Country . ''
This song is often listed as `` Scarborough Fair/Canticle . ''
On The Paul Simon Songbook , a little known 1965 UK album of Simon-solo demos , there is a song called `` The Side Of a Hill . ''
`` The Side Of a Hill '' was reworked into the Canticle part of `` Scarborough Fair . ''
