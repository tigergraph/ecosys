This song starts just after the singer and the girl in the song have had sex .
She has been cheating on him and he knows it , he just wo n't confront her about it because , as he puts it , `` Gentlemen do n't ask questions .
they just keep quiet and pay attention . ''
He 's worried because once her parents find out what 's going on they 're going to be mad .
He 's lost because he thinks he 's the nicer guy and he ca n't understand what she sees in him .
