This song is a sequel to the chaste `` Let 's Wait Awhile '' from Jackson 's previous album , Control .
She told VH1 : `` I felt a little bit more comfortable with letting people a little more into my world .
` Someday Is Tonight ' is a continuation of , ` OK , now that you 've waited this long ... ' And I even say in the song , ' I know I promised I 'd be worth the wait / The wait is over , please do n't hesitate . ' ''
But her sexier material did n't go over well with everyone .
She recalled : `` Someone said to me a long time ago ... ` What message are you sending to the kids ?
You talked about ` Let 's Wait a While . ''
And I said , ` Well , I 'm in my '20s now .
How long do you want me to wait ? ' ''
