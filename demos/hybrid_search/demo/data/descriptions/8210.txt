A 1999 demo of this song which was recorded in guitarist Bill Ryder-Jones house eventually ended up on the band 's 2008 The Singles Collection .
Frontman James Skelly explained on his record label 's website : `` It 's not really a good song but we wanted to include it because it 's got loads of character , and it shows where ` In The Morning ' came from just a few years later . ''
