Wild Beasts ' drummer Chris Talbott really comes to the fore on this short avant-garde pop song about selfishness .
Said bassist Tom Fleming to Drowned in Sound : `` Chris plays his drums like a leviathan , and we prefer to hide under our professors desks , covering him in pads and arpeggiators .
One of the snare sounds is 12-ton forge hammer , recorded to floppy disk 20 years ago , and another is a bike chain on a bongo .
It seemed fussy to put anything much over those three bass notes , so we really did n't . ''
The Wild Beasts write copiously about sex and this song includes an invitation to `` take off your chemise and let me do as I please . ''
`` We openly admit to being obsessed with sex , '' Fleming told The Guardian .
`` We say things really bluntly at times -- we like to be earthy .
The effects of sex and sexuality are really interesting . ''
Lead singer Hayden Thorpe explained the song 's meaning to Q magazine : `` It 's a voyeuristic nod to the slightly creepier elements of romance and the disturbing parts of people 's desires . ''
