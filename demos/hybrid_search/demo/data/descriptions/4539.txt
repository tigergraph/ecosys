This gritty predatory rocker features Dave Grohl on drums and some `` ooh la las '' with a gang chorus courtesy of Arctic Monkeys ' frontman Alex Turner , Screaming Trees ' Mark Lanegan and QOTSA alumnus Nick Oliveri .
Josh Homme has known Alex Turner for a while , having produced his band 's 2009 album , Humbug and sung backup on their track `` All My Own Stunts . ''
Homme told NME : `` With Alex it was like , ` Will you come over here just for a few hours and drink tequila and maybe we could sing something ? '
and he 's like , ` Yup . ' ''
Ever since Oliveri was fired from the Queens in 2004 , fans have clamored for his return to the band , Reuniting with his former bassist turned out to one of the easiest things Homme had done in a long time .
He told NME : `` Nick recorded his record -LRB- with his band Mondo Generator -RRB- at my studio , and he was dropping some vinyl off and was like , ` Er , need background vocals ? '
and I was like , ` Yeah . '
So he sang on ` If I Had A Tail ' .
Him and Mark Lanegan are going ` Oooohohohooo . '
It 's just friends you know .
And that 's good enough for me . ''
The song has become a live favorite .
Josh Homme commented to NME : `` That 's a song that people gravitate to .
I do n't know that ` If I Had A Tail ' is cathartic , it 's just the sort of tune that when you play it you feel like you 're wearing your f -- k-me pumps .
Everyone in the crowd is dancing , singing , smiling , arms in the air : What more could you want ? ''
Homme told Mojo magazine regarding the song 's lyrical content : `` Its combining ` Lady Marmalade , ' and Shaun Cassidy .
I do n't know why , but the flip nature of that song brought out ` getcha-getcha ooh-la-la ' and Shaun Cassidy 's ` Da Doo Ron Ron . '
It 's not like chocolate and peanut butter , it 's like chocolate and go-f -- k-yourself . ''
