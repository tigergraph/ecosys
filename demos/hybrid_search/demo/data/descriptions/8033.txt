The song 's music video is presented as a mockumentary about Mann 's past as vocalist for 'Til Tuesday .
In the clip a decision is made to recreate the music video for the group 's best-known hit , `` Voices Carry , '' scene by scene , against the wishes of Mann .
The visual was directed by comedian Tom Scharpling and features Mad Men 's Jon Hamm as well as his comedy partner , Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster , who plays Mann 's love interest .
Also featuring are punk musician Ted Leo and former 'Til Tuesday drummer Michael Hausman , who is now Mann 's manager.Mann told Spinner : Tom Scharpling is the guy who directed it .
He 's a comedy writer .
His instincts are so dead on and he felt like there was sort of a nostalgic interest -LSB- in the `` Voices Carry '' video -RSB- but also a ridiculousness factor - especially if the setup was that I was coerced into it .
He thought -LSB- that -RSB- was really funny and I totally agree .
And having Jon Wurster , who 's a good friend of mine , play the guy in the -LSB- video -RSB- .
He 's so funny and he 's got this high voice so it 's even more ridiculous .
I thought it was a real inspired idea . ''
