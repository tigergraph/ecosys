Vocalist Nathan Leone told Rock Sound magazine : `` We were on the fence with this one forever because we could n't settle on a verse strategy .
Mateo -LSB- Camargo , guitar -RSB- had this raw rock riff and we kept over thinking it trying to make it more interesting but at the end of the day , the more we took out , the better it got .
It 's one of the heavier tracks on the record which are always my favorite . ''
Nathan Leone explained the song 's meaning to Rock Sound magazine : `` Lyrically it 's about heading straight into a situation you know is bad for you .
As if your heart and subconscious can see it crystal clear but your mind denies it I think so many things are lost in psychological torment as opposed to just letting them happen . ''
