This was written by Chips Moman and Dan Penn in 30 minutes when they were at a DJ convention in Nashville .
Penn , who also delivered the harmonies on this track described this is as `` a straightforward Country cheating ballad . ''
In 1969 this was covered in a Country-Soul style by The Flying Burrito Brothers on their classic The Gilded Palace of Sin album .
They also covered another Moman/Penn R&B song `` Do Right Woman '' on the same set .
Other artists to cover it include Aretha Franklin , Linda Ronstadt and Percy Sledge .
Penn recalled to Mojo magazine January 2008 how they came to write this song : `` Me and Chips were in a poker game , and we took a break and went back to our room .
And there was a guitar and we started the song .
I wrote it as far as I could and handed it to him and we finished it up really fast .
It was maybe a year before James Carr recorded it .
And the reason James Carr got it was because he was next .
That 's the way they used to get the songs in Memphis , whoever was next got the next song . ''
Penn added : `` James Carr , he had some great records but he was kind of an Otis sound-alike .
But when he did ` Dark End Of The Street ' I think he found his own voice .
He never sounded like that again , I think he had some problems -LRB- Carr had a drug addiction -RRB- .
But he was one great singer .
His record ca n't be touched .
The whole make-up of the record , it screams 1966 .
There 's something about that time that got on that tape that I 've never heard anybody get that close to . ''
