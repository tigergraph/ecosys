Jefferson , Georgia native Bradley Gilbert penned this song with John Eddie about being torn between spending time in Nashville getting his music career going and going back home to his girl .
He explained to KNUE 101.5 FM that the song talks , `` about being indecisive about whether or not we were actually going to be together , or if I was gon na chase this thing .
I chose her .
Things just did n't work out because I was still holding onto this one - to a dream I 've had for a long time .
It kind of just came down to going back to her at the end of that one . ''
Gilbert told The Boot the song has a second meaning .
`` In my career , there 's a lot of pressure , '' he explained .
`` You had to move to Nashville if you were going to make it .
I never really bought into it , but I agreed to take some writing appointments with some people from Warner Chappell .
`` Gilbert had a co-write set up with a guy named John Eddie but he and his girlfriend had a fight before he left , so the singer-songwriter decided he needed to get his priorities in order .
`` I was on the way up to Nashville to write with him , '' he said .
`` To make a long story short , I ended up turning around and going home and canceling the appointment .
We rescheduled with him , and that day we wrote about what happened the day I cancelled ... It was just a real experience . ''
The same girl also inspired another track on the deluxe edition of Halfway To Heaven , `` Hell On an Angel . ''
The song was n't in Gilbert 's mind to be a single , but he explained to The Boot , `` it was one of those songs that walked its way into the single-picking process . ''
He added : `` It came up in conversation one day and we listened to it again and we were like , ` Let 's research a couple of -LSB- potential singles -RSB- . '
It came out looking pretty good so we went with it .
It had a double meaning for me because it was a song that was pretty close to my heart , so we let it go . ''
