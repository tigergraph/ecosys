On October 10 , 2009 , Boyzone member Stephen Gately tragically died at the age of 33 of a pulmonary edema , or fluid in the lungs .
This song , which features Gately 's co-lead vocals , was released as the Irish band 's first single since the loss of their bandmate and served as something of a tribute to him .
London-based singer-songwriter Mika wrote the song .
It was originally meant to be Boyzone 's comeback single after their 2007 reformation .
However , Mika did not allow it but after Gately 's death , he gave the all clear for it to be released as a tribute to the late singer .
Mika said on the Boyzone website : `` I was shocked and saddened when I hear about Stephen 's passing , he touched so many people 's lives both with his music and with his wonderful personality .
It 's an honour to hear him sing my song .
I wish all the best to the rest of the boys .
I 'm proud of the song and proud of their version . ''
