Keating recorded this as a duet with the British singer Kate Rusby .
Keating also recorded alternate versions of the song with different singers from around that world : Jessica Andersson from Sweden , Rita Guerra from Portugal , Rita Comisi from Italy , Kelly Chen from China and Floortje Smit from Holland .
This was written by Randy Goodrum and Don Mescall .
Goodrum wrote `` You Needed Me , '' which was a # 1 UK hit for Keating 's band Boyzone .
Mescall is a popular Irish songwriter and musician .
In our interview with Randy Goodrum , he explained : `` It was n't necessarily written for Ronan , but that was a great record .
That was a very dramatic production , actually , compared to ` You Needed Me . '
That one goes from total soft to just flat-out , and I like those kind of dynamics .
I 'm not sure record companies and radio are comfortable with that , they 'd rather things be a little more level .
But I like real dramatic songs like that , that you just unload the kitchen sink in the chorus .
And I loved his concept .
He did it as a duet and he used different noted singers from different territories to do the female part .
It was very ingenious doing it that way , I felt . ''
