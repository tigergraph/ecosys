Vocalist Matt Davies-Kreye told Kerrang !
magazine September 13 , 2008 the story of this song : `` This song is the counterpoint to ` Constant Illuminations , ' but whereas that song is an angry attack , this is a more restrained , reflective look on the loss of innocence and how we choose to ignore the important issues and events that go on around us.This song came about through a jam session that we had while Kris -LSB- Coombes-Roberts , guitar -RSB- was travelling down to the writing sessions .
I picked up the guitar and started playing the little guitar part , Gareth -LSB- Ellis-Davies , bass -RSB- started the movement into the chorus section and we put the music down using either Garage Band or Logic and waited for Kris to have a listen .
He really liked it and added a complimentary guitar part along with mine and Darran 's then Ryan -LSB- Richards , drums -RSB- added some really cool synth and loops to really liven it up .
It 's such a haunting song . ''
