`` For this video , we wanted to show the depth and versatility to our story , '' she told The Boombox .
`` With ` Bombs , ' we focused on full out choreography .
We wan na bring something new every time we release a visual .
With ` Automatic , ' it 's more story-focused .
It 's the rebellion against what the world wants you to be and what really lies underneath it all when you realize your own self-worth . ''
