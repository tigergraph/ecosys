This song is about the D-Day invasion during World War II and the effect it had on the young soldiers who fought that day .
-LRB- thanks , mike - Orleans , IN -RRB- The song does not mention which beach the story takes place , however , if one interprets the lyrics , the song most likely takes place on Omaha Beach , which was the beach with the most casualties out of all five invasion beaches combined .
