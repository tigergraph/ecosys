The album title is taken from the lyrics of this song : `` You ca n't get rid of me that easy , no , not without a fight . ''
Drummer Cyrus Bolooki explained the album title to Front And Center Rock : `` I think it just kind of goes in with the whole idea that we 've been around for a while , and we really feel like a resurgence for us that after eleven years now we 're still relevant .
We 're on tours with bands like Four Year Strong , A Day To Remember and ya know , a lot of these bands maybe they first got into bands like us , and it 's almost like another generation .
But it makes us feel awesome that we 're still out here and I hope that people do n't just think we 're like the old guys out there . ''
