Leonard Cohen closes his twelfth studio album Old Ideas with an argument .
The Hammond organ-fuelled soft-shoe shuffle is a witty examination of a lovers ' tiff .
`` C'mon baby give me a kiss / Stop writing everything down , '' he croons .
Old Ideas is actually an old idea as it was the original name for 2004 's Dear Heather .
Cohen was persuaded to drop it as it was feared people would assume it was a retrospective .
Cohen is supported by some angelic female voices supplied by Sharon Robinson and the Webb Sisters .
Longtime collaborator Sharon Robinson first started working with Cohen on his 1979 Field Commander Cohen tour .
An established songwriter in her own right , Robinson won a Grammy Award in 1985 for co-writing `` New Attitude '' with Patti LaBelle for the movie Beverly Hills Cop .
She has also written with Cohen , and for 2001 's Ten New Songs she wrote all the music , performed virtually all the parts and produced the album.Charley and Hattie Webb hail from Kent in England .
In addition to their gorgeous harmony singing , Hattie plays harp and mandolin while Charley performs on the guitar , piano , clarinet and saxophone .
The sisters were part of Cohen 's 2008-10 world tour and are featured on the Leonard Cohen Live in London backing Cohen on the song `` If It Be Your Will . ''
