The Path of Totality is comprised entirely of songs made with dubstep and electro house producers and this song was recorded by Korn with Noisia , a Dutch Electronic music trio consisting of members Nik Roos , Martijn van Sonderen and Thijs de Vlieger .
Frontman Jonathan Davis told the story of the song to Artist Direct : `` It 's actually at 125 BPM .
It 's not really even considered dubstep .
They gave me a short little sample of that .
I wrote the lyric around it , and I sang it .
I sent it back to Noisia and they did their little finishing touches and it was done . ''
Davis explained the song 's meaning to Artist Direct : `` It 's about a love-hate relationship .
You 're saying ` I 'm over you ' and then you 're saying , ' I need you . '
` Let 's Go ' has a double meaning .
It means , ` Let 's get out of here and we 'll go do something ' or ` Let 's go , I 'm out of here . ' ''
