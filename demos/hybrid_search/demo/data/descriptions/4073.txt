Sexsmith penned this song about all the stupid fooling around he was doing before he met his second wife Colleen .
He explained to UK newspaper , The Guardian : `` I was 21 when I became a dad so I spent my 20s putting the kids to bed and stuff .
So when I got a record deal ... I mean , I 'm not like Brad Pitt or anything , but there would be girls in , say , Norway who had heard my record and already made up their mind that they liked me .
So you show up there and there she is ... this was kind of the situation everywhere I went .
So for a while I had girlfriends in different cities and was juggling all of that .
I mean , I 'm glad I got to experience all that but it was very stressful .
When I met my second wife Colleen it made me realise that the fooling around was nowhere for me . ''
Sexsmith explained to CBC Music : `` This was just about meeting my wife and realizing it was something I should investigate or else I might miss the boat on it .
Like last chance for love or something .
I was in the middle of my acting stupid and doing all the dumb things that hurt everyone in my family in the first place , so when I met her I just felt that where I was going was nowhere .
The song is about me looking back with a sense of relief . ''
