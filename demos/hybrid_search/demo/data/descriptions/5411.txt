This song was written as a reminder to show affection to the people closest to you , as you never know when it will be too late .
Singer Gary LeVox told CMT News that this track could be interpreted as a message of support towards the gay community too .
He explained : `` We actually have some gay people that work with us , and we have a lot of friends that are gay , too , and I know that this song has inspired them .
I know that coming out was tough on their parents and on them and the whole entire family .
For a long time , some of them did n't get to hear ' I love you ' from their dads or be accepted in that way .
... It 's helped a lot of our friends .
`` Guitarist Joe Don Rooney added : `` That 's what 's cool about our music .
You can interpret -LRB- it like -RRB- that .
If you get that - it 's perfect .
If you are someone who 's gay or someone who 's straight , you still feel something from the song , and that 's what we want . ''
