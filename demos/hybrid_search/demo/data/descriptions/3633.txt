This song finds vocalist-keyboardist Alejandra Deheza spelling out P-R-E-D-A-T-O-R over an aggressive beat .
She explained how that moment fits into the song to Consequence of Sound : `` It 's definitely an aggressive song .
It 's realizing that sometimes certain people when they show up in your life , and you think it 's a random happening , you begin to realize in hindsight that those people are sometimes just there to take advantage of -LSB- sighs -RSB- certain situations .
Sometimes when you 're feeling shi -- y , you may end up in situations you normally would never find yourself in .
And you realize that a lot of times , those motives are devious .
Which is not to take away personal accountability , but it 's also addressing the other side of it .
` If I 'm going to be accountable , so are you . '
That 's where the ` predator ' thing comes from . ''
One of the inspirations for the song 's lyrics was the Ten Of Swords card from the Secret Tarot by Italian artist Marco Nizzo .
Deheza explained to Spin magazine : `` Aside from the fact that the colors in this -LRB- card -RRB- are completely killer , they also remind me of a sunset .
This dude seems to be in a pretty bad situation , but the sky signals the end of it .
The story in this card , to me , is about seeing the truth about a bad situation in hindsight -- not being afraid to call it what it was and realizing your role in it .
In Ghostory , it definitely reminds me of the song ` Low Times . '
It 's about the end of a cycle that screams for a rebirth , and taking the reins back . ''
