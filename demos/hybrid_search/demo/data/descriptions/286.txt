This sexual romp is a bouncy marching song full of horns , looped samples , cossack-like music and call-and-response vocals .
It finds Gaga singing of a S&M desire for being tied up and bitten .
The tune was produced by Teddy Riley , who was an architect of the late 1980s and early '90s New Jack Swing sound and was responsible for hits by Bobby Brown , Guy , and Keith Sweat .
He went on to work with many leading names in the music industry including Boyz II Men , Snoop Dogg and the late Michael Jackson .
Riley 's daughter Taja Riley was credited with co-writing the song .
However , her father sued her in 2013 for copyright infringement and fraud claiming that she did n't co-pen the tune .
The New Jack Swing pioneer said that she lied about the songwriting credit and should not have received a publishing deal from EMI Music .
Teddy Riley also filed suit against Lady Gaga later in the same year , claiming he was promised 25 % of writing fees , but has received nothing .
