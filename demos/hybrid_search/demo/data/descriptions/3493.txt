With lyrics by Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy , this song is the second in his 5-part `` Twelve-step Suite , '' which details his recovery through the Alcoholics Anonymous 12 Step program .
This song covers steps 4 and 5 , which Portnoy calls `` Reflections of Reality -LRB- Revisited -RRB- '' and `` Release . ''
In our 2010 interview with Mike Portnoy , he explained : `` When I got sober 10 years ago , I decided I wanted to start writing songs about the 12 steps .
And rather than just writing one song about everything , I had this idea of writing one song that was steps 1 , 2 and 3 , then the next album continue with the song that was step 4 and 5 , and so on and so forth .
And `` The Shattered Fortress '' off the latest album is the final chapter , which is steps 10 , 11 and 12 , and ultimately these five songs that have taken 5 albums to complete ultimately will fit together and they all have running common themes and melodies and riffs and lyrics , and it all ties together like one giant puzzle that hopefully we 'll be playing live someday .
