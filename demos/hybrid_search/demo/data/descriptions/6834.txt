This song is about the fear of death and dying without accomplishing your hopes and dreams .
Lead singer Brandon Flowers ' fear of flying is also referenced in the lyrics -LRB- `` Help me get down '' ... -RRB- as is his obsession with the day he 'll die -LRB- apparently as a kid a Ouija board once told him that he would die on June 21 , the day of his birthday -RRB- .
It sounds , in the chorus , as if he 's praying to God -LRB- referred to as `` Father '' -RRB- , and saying that if he knew the day he was going to die , and was sure that it would be in the right time he would n't be bothering Him and keep on counting the days .
In an interview with the New Musical Express -LRB- NME -RRB- , Brandon Flowers talked about his fear of flying : `` It 's something that 's become a real problem for me since we got successful .
But I feel as though if I talk about it in interviews , it lessens the chances of my fears actually happening .
Like , I 've talked about it , so it would have to be a huge coincidence for it to actually happen to me .
Does that make sense ?
It seems way more improbable than if I did n't talk about my fears of what might happen .
That 's why I 've been seeing a psychiatrist , once a week for the last few months .
To talk about my fear . ''
-LRB- thanks , Simone - Sam 's Town , Brazil , for above 2 -RRB-
