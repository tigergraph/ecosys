Confessions centers itself around The Seven Deadly Sins and the four elements .
Frontman Josh Todd explained to Classic Rock Revisited : `` At first , we thought that we would just do seven songs about The Seven Sins and put out an EP .
When it came time to make a record , we really needed more than an EP .
I came up with the idea for seven songs for Seven Sins and four elements .
That is where songs like ` Air ' and ` Water ' came from . ''
