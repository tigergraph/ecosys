This song about achieving your goals despite resistance from others uses some prominent samples .
The chorus is based on the 1983 Matthew Wilder song `` Break My Stride , '' which has a similar , but lighter theme of getting past those who want to bring you down .
The rhythm track comes from `` The Message '' by Grandmaster Flash And The Furious Five .
-LRB- thanks , Donovan Berry - El Dorado , AR -RRB- In our interview with Matthew Wilder , he recalls the first time hearing this song , which interpolated his hit `` Break My Stride . ''
