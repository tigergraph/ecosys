Bassist Tai Anderson commented on this song in promotional materials : `` We 've all had those mountaintop experiences .
You feel so close to God .
You can see for miles .
Vision galore .
Then life happens , the valley , the struggles .
We often think that the valley is a consequence for the sin of our life .
But , maybe it 's just our life .
We 're all promised struggle .
We all experience suffering .
The hope that we have is wonderfully expressed in this song .
` You were there with me . '
We do n't have to go through the inevitable trials of life on our own . ''
Third Day were awarded the 2006 Grammy for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album of the Year for Wherever You Are .
