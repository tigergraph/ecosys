Peace vocalist Harrison Koisser told NME : `` It 's the only really dark song on the album .
I wrote it late at night on a bridge .
Weird . ''
The band were intent on finding the perfect click for this song .
Said Koisser : `` I will always stand by the clicking sound before the second verse on ` Float Forever . '
We spent one complete day with me flicking every switch I could find . ''
