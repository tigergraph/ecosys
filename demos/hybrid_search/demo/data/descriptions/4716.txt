This was released as the lead single from Best Intentions , the first full length studio album by American Pop-Punk band We Are the In Crowd .
Vocalist Tay Jardine told Kerrang !
magazine : `` The lyrics to this song are really important to me , because they remind me to take the high road , and to not let a little gossip get to me .
Sometimes I even find myself revisiting the state of mind I was when I wrote them , and they mean more .
When people tell me that these lyrics mean something to them , I feel a sense of company . ''
