Busta told HipHop.com the story behind this song : `` We was in Miami at a South Beach club called Privee .
They had a long VIP area , and at the end there 's a DJ booth and a long row of tables on either side .
By the DJ booth is where the people who spend the most money are put , because it 's away from all the people who 're walking past .
It 's a little darker , cool , sexy .
They had some guys who looked like stockbrokers , and , long story short , there was this young guy , 24 , 25 , with a real clean suit on , looked like they brokered a great deal and were in there celebratin ' .
A couple thugs came through the VIP section and wanted to sit at the table , but this guy was n't movin ' - he came early and was spendin ' money .
The thug started makin ' a scene , and he was disruptin ' the energy - everybody was having a good time before he came and the whole VIP had a problem with the kid .
And five minutes in , the 24-year-old dude twisted this guy like a Rubik 's Cube configuration - I guess he knew some martial arts s -- t. His boys had to help him up .
The bottom line is the guy who did n't look dangerous was the most dangerous .
Anyway , the thug gets up and he 's like , ` I ` mma sue this club !
Where my earring at ? '
And as he 's leavin ' he says , ` I ` mma go get my gun ! '
But he ai n't come back .
So I made this song for all the bigmouths . ''
