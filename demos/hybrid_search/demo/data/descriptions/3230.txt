Project 86 lead singer Andrew Schwab explained to jesusfreakhideout.com : `` I guess the key line in the song is ` Deep in the recess of every man is a thief , a robber , a criminal . '
That whole concept .
It 's just saying that we 're all on an even playing field - Billy Graham or just a destitute person searching for something .
We are all equipped from birth with a hole in the middle of us that can really only be fulfilled by one thing .
And the song sort of outlines striving to meet that hole by everything and anything except that and ultimately coming back to the realization that you can only be fulfilled in one area and that 's God .
And that 's kind of the theme of the album as well . ''
