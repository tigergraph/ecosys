This is the title track of Swedish folk duo , First Aid Kit 's , second album .
The two sisters explained the title of the set to The Sun : `` A lion roaring is essentially an emotion being expressed .
We wanted to express our emotions more ` loudly ' and more clearly with this record .
This is reflected in the lyrics as well as in the arrangements . ''
First Aid Kit hooked up with Bright Eyes guitarist Mike Mogis to produce The Lion 's Roar in Nebraska .
They explained to The Sun how the collaboration came about : `` Since we heard Bright Eyes , our biggest dream has been to work with Mike .
We never thought we 'd actually get to do it , let alone this early on in our career .
After Monsters Of Folk 's -LRB- which Mogis plays in -RRB- show in Stockholm in 2009 was over , we went backstage to meet them and gave them our CD .
We were really nervous and starstruck .
A year later -LRB- Bright eyes frontman -RRB- Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis showed up when we played at Austin City Limits festival in Texas .
They had listened to the CD and loved it .
Later we got a message from our manager saying Mike wanted to produce the record .
We were like `` Hell yeah !
Let 's do it ! ''
