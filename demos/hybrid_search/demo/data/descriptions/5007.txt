This is a track from Lynyrd Skynyrd 's twelfth studio album , God & Guns .
This song was written after the death of keyboardist Billy Powell in January 2009 .
Vocalist Johnny Van Zant recalled to Billboard magazine : `` I was on the computer right after Billy passed away , and was just seeing the messages that people were posting .
Somebody said , ` Will the Skynyrd nation go on ? '
I thought , ` Wow , I never thought of it as being a nation , but it really is . '
So I called up Gary -LRB- Rossington -RRB- and Rickey -LRB- Medlocke -RRB- and I said , ` Man , we 've got to write a song called ` Skynyrd Nation , ' and we did .
It 's a party kind of song , just an upbeat kind of thing . ''
