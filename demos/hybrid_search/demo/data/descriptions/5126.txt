Singer and keyboardist Chris Keating explained to MTV News : `` That 's a song that I had been working on for a while .
It 's really old .
I set up a bunch of samplers and plugged them all into the TV for a whole Sunday , and I got , like , four channels , did n't have cable or anything , so it was all , like , daytime Sunday weirdness , bad commercials , infomercials , soap operas , I do n't know what .
And I recorded four banks of sound and started to structure a song out of it .
And I sang on top of it .
I thought it was cool to make this real paranoid .
I liked the late - '70s era of David Bowie that 's very paranoid , where he 's , like , so coke-addled and crazy , and I like that kind of feel , and mixing it with the sort of 24-hour news cycle , and Glenn Beck and Hannity , the sort of absurd , psychotic rants that those guys go on .
I sort of think it 's amazing , because it just seems like something out of the movie Network .
I do n't know ; the world is going to end in a year . ''
Guitarist Anand Wilder told Drowned in Sound : '' ` Mondegreen ' was a song that Chris made a long time ago and I laid some guitar over it .
I really liked the lyrics , about a guy so paranoid he ca n't even leave his house .
We had a kind of cheap horn riff and then we recorded some real ones but were happier with the crappy synths ones we 'd used .
And I really liked the outro , using computers to slow everything down , like it was falling into this K-Hole . ''
