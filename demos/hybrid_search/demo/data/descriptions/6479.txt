Country Music Television -LRB- CMT -RRB- asked bass guitarist Jay DeMarcus what attracted Rascal Flatts to this song .
He replied : `` I think the simple message of that song is what attracted me to ` Every Day . '
It 's one of those simple yet profound lyrics .
When you hear that chorus and he says , ` Every day you save my life , ' it hits you like a ton of bricks .
There are so many people that come in and out of your life that you feel that way about .
So many people have stood behind me for so long .
I immediately thought of my mom and how encouraging she was to me over the years , struggling in Nashville , and I wanted to give up and come back home and get an ordinary job somewhere .
That song really moved me when I thought about those people that are in my life that I lean on so heavily .
My wife , my family , it 's just a really great song . ''
