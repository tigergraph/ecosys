Dave Matthews explained this song to Relix magazine : `` It 's a goodbye song .
It 's a heartbreaker .
That 's a hard one for me to listen to .
I love the strings that Dave Campbell arranged .
When we first played it , we had a whole band arrangement , and it was pretty loud .
But when I wrote the lyrics , the song said , ` I 'm not loud !
I 'm just big chords .
Play me quietly and then I 'll make sense . '
The interesting thing about lyrics sometimes : they can be really demanding .
If I did n't feel so strongly about those lyrics , I probably would have turned to some other lyrics that fit with the heavier groove .
But those lyrics they landed right where I wanted them .
So then I said , ` What do I have to do to make these lyrics land ? '
And so that meant just play the guitar . ''
The album was produced by Rob Cavallo -LRB- Green Day , My Chemical Romance -RRB- He told Relix about his use of a string section : `` There are three songs that have a mini-orchestra on them : ` Dive In ' ` Squirm , ' and this lovely , touching ballad .
With the size and scope of this album , I thought I 'd use a larger string section than I normally do with a rock band .
We ended up using 30 pieces -- 18 violins , four violas , six cellos , and two double-bass -- and that 's quite a larger size .
Usually you hear of something more like 20 pieces in rock .
It 's on the larger end of the scale before it turns into a symphony -- which you would n't want . ''
The band 's sax player , LeRoi Moore , tragically passed away in the summer of 2008 as a result of an accident on his farm .
Matthews told Relix about his contribution to this song : `` Roi really liked that one .
His musical instincts were like no one else 's that I 'd ever met in my life , and with that song , Roi said , ` Man , that 's a big song -- do n't make it too big . '
And he was right , because in the end , I took everything off and just had the little guitar . ''
