Red Light Company singer Richard Frenneaux -LRB- from Clash Magazine -RRB- : `` The song has strong references to drugs , overdosing .
For me , the poignancy of it is in the first verse .
It 's writing and love that are the two things that are important and help you to be remembered ... ` As long as there 's some time to writeScribble my thoughts tonightAnd steal a kiss alrightI 'll still survive'I think every writer , or creative person , has a desire to be remembered in their own way ; I was trying to express that from the beginning .
It was a statement of intent for the rest of the record , that 's why it was important for me to keep this as the first track . ''
