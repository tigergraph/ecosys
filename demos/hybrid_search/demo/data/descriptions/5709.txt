This song sees Mayer as more than a little down on his current music colleagues as he yearns for someone who can `` play a song that I can sing '' and `` make me feel as I am free . ''
He goes on to turn his nose up at the kind of acts who `` celebrate broken things . ''
`` You can tell something is n't right , when all your heroes are in black and white , '' he sings .
