This Ed Hill and Karyn Rochelle penned piano ballad was released in April 2005 as the lead-off single for Trisha Yearwood 's ninth studio album , Jasper County .
It became her first Top 40 country hit since `` Inside Out , '' in 2001 , reaching # 15 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart .
This was the first hit single penned by Nashville songwriter Karyn Rochelle .
She has gone on to co-write tunes for the likes of Kellie Pickler -LRB- `` Makin ' Me Fall In Love Again '' -RRB- and Sunny Sweeney -LRB- `` From a Table Away '' -RRB- .
Yearwood 's husband , Garth Brooks , provides backup harmony vocals for the song .
The song was originally titled `` A Gust of Rain , '' but its lyrics were altered upon Yearwood 's request to include references to Jasper County .
After writing this song with Ed Hill , Rochelle told him she felt they should their demo to Yearwood .
`` I really ca n't explain it , '' she recalled to American Songwriter magazine in a July 2012 interview , `` I just knew it was meant for her .
Ed agreed and my publisher sent the song over to her producer .
Trisha had taken a few years off at that time but was making a new record .
Her producer , Garth Fundis , invited me over to the studio to hear it after they had finished recording it .
I sat down at the control board and listened with tears in my eyes .
To me , Trisha has the most incredible female voice Nashville has ever heard .
To hear her sing the words and melody that I wrote was the most surreal experience ever . ''
The Rocky Schenck directed music video was shot near Yearwood 's hometown of Monticello , Georgia .
