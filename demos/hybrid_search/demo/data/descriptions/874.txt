This track was originally going to be a bonus song but guitarist Zoltan Bathory explained to Metal Hammer , `` it turned out so well -- so primal , so stark -- that we decided to include it on the album . ''
Producer Kevin Churko encouraged frontman and lyricist Ivan Moody to take a highly personal approach throughout the record , and this song is about his self-destructive nature .
Bathory explained to Kerrang !
: `` He definitely has multiple personalities that cause his life to be surrounded by chaos , and on this song he gives a really deep insight into the way that he is and the way that his mind works . ''
