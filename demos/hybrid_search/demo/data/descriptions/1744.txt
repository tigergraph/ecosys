Matt Berniger ruminates on mortality on this drum-heavy song .
`` God loves everybody , do n't remind me , '' he sings .
Berninger 's relationship to the afterlife is often fragile .
On another Trouble Will Find Me track , `` Do n't Swallow the Cap '' he sings about his fear of leaving his loved ones behind .
The song 's black and white music video finds The National getting drunk and getting up to all sorts of mischief , which includes riding bikes into a pool and shooting off a potato gun .
The clip was shot at frontman Matt Berninger 's parent 's house in Cincinnati , Ohio and found the band suffering a series of mishaps .
Bassist Scott Devendorf ended up with a minor concussion , guitarist Bryce Dessner injured his back , and Berninger suffered a face injury whilst riding his bike into a swimming pool and hitting the water hard with his face all three times .
`` I had glasses on , '' he explained to Rolling Stone `` I had bruises around my eyes where the glasses hit .
It was the most brutal video we 've ever done .
It was really fun , but it cost us .
No one died , though . ''
The National premiered the song during an April 5 , 2013 concert at the Michelberger Hotel in Berlin .
