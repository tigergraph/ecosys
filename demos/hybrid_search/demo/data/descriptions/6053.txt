This screaming metallic song may be one of the heaviest numbers that Linkin Park have recorded to date , but it also incorporates several other music genres .
Speaking with Abcdane.net , Chester Bennington said : `` It starts with what sounds like folk , then rapidly dips into Hip-Hop , Punk Rock , Death Metal and back to Folk music .
It 's just crazy , in a way there 's no real meaning to it .
One of the things I like about our new album is that we included a song like this .
It 's because of these things that I love our band so much .
We have so many different faces ... you ca n't really pin us to one location , and that 's exactly what we 've been aiming for . ''
Bassist Dave `` Phoenix '' Farrel noted to Musique Mag that the song 's working title , `` Battle Axe '' , `` is ... what that song is ; it 's just this big ` crack ' and then you 're out . ''
At 1:46 , this is one of the shortest songs Linkin Park have recorded , which is due to the minimal content of tunes by punk bands such as Pennywise and Dirty Rotten Imbeciles that influenced this track .
