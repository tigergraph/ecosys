This track about a man 's affinity to his lady 's birthmark , is built around an acoustic guitar and has a Country feel .
Akon told Blues and Soul magazine why he decided to make a foray into Country music .
He explained : `` I think that Country music is a wide-open - and potentially very lucrative - market for today 's urban artists .
Because you have to remember that rhythm & blues and country all expanded from the same thing .
The only difference is the adaptation of it all , and how it 's been perceived and actually marketed over the years .
So yeah , eventually I will probably step away from everything and just try to do one of those kinda records to see how it would come out .
Because musicalIy I feel like there 's nothing , or nowhere , else different left for me to go !
You know , I always want to set myself a challenge by doing something no-one would expect me to do !
But , having said that , I do n't feel as a musician you can steer TOO far away from what you normally do .
Which is why ` Birthmark ' , beat-wise , does still have a kinda underlying urban/hip hop feel .
So my country album probably wo n't sound totally like full-blown country music .
Because , at the end of the day , I got ta do stuff the way I understand it ! ''
