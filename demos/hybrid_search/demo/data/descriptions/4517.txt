Brice penned this emotional ballad during a writing retreat with his buddies Jon Stone and Billy Montana .
He recalled : `` Me and Billy Montana and Jon Stone went on a retreat outside of Portland , and just had the time of our lives , fishing , sitting in a cabin and writing some great songs .
Then I went into the studio and just played acoustic guitar with a microphone .
That 's all that song really needed .
It 's definitely real .
So many people have come to me and said that song really touched them . ''
Brice on the song 's meaning : `` This song says , ` Girls , if your guy 's not appreciating you or giving you the things you need , you need to tell him .
Maybe he 's oblivious or maybe he just does n't care .
But either way , you 've got to let him know . '
It says a lot to guys too . ''
