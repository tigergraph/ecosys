Director 's Cut is an album by English singer Kate Bush consisting of eleven reworked and/or entirely re-recorded songs from her The Sensual World and The Red Shoes sets .
All of the tracks retain their old titles except for this song , which was originally called `` The Sensual World . ''
Bush had wanted to use the words of James Joyce 's character Molly Bloom from Ulysses for `` The Sensual World , '' but she was refused and had to write her own lyrics for the track .
A couple of decades later , she was eventually given the green light to use the soliloquy at the end of the book in her re-recording of the song .
She explained : `` Originally when I wrote the song ` The Sensual World ' I had used text from the end of Ulysses by James Joyce , put to a piece of music I had written .
When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused , which was disappointing .
I then wrote my own lyrics for the song although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting.Well , I 'm not James Joyce am I ?
When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes .
It is now re-titled ` Flower Of the Mountain ' and I am delighted that I have had the chance to fulfill the original concept . ''
