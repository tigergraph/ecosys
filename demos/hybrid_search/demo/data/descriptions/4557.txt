TobyMac explained in publicity materials : `` The heart of the song was simply a prayer that unravels in conversational terms , honest and vulnerable .
I describe my morning ` The dream is fading now I 'm staring at the door . ' ''
God it 's you and me here alone , but I 'm about to go face this day and all that comes with it .
It 's so easy for all of us to forget what matters to us in the midst of the chaos the world throws at us .
This song is about the moment we remember ... ' I was made to love and be loved by you . ' ''
This track made its mark in space in September 2009 when it was played to wake up the Space Shuttle crew as Discovery closed in on the international space station .
Astronaut Nicole Stott 's 7-year-old son , Roman , requested the song .
