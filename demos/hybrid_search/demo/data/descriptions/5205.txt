This is an autobiographical tale about Estelle living in an apartment above a dead man .
She told Giantmag the story of the song : `` Oh , that man - he was really old , like extremely old and he had no one coming up to see him , no one to comfort him .
But he had all of these cats .
Before we knew he passed , my mom began wondering about the smell and she would be like ` Estelle , clean up your room ' -LRB- laughs -RRB- .
One day , we went downstairs and banged on his door just to check on him and no one answered .
And I thought to myself , maybe he 's dead and sure enough he was . ''
In the same interview with Giantmag.com , Estelle , who was born on January 18th 1980 , was asked why she titled her album The 18th Day : `` 18 , it represents my birthday .
My first album , The 18th Day , was a dedication to my mother .
During my birth she had a procedure that left her near death , but she came back in time to give birth to me .
So the album was almost like me thanking her for bringing me here . ''
This was Estelle 's debut single .
