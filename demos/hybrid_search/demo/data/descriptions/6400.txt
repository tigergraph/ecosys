Jones commented in press materials that Balm In Gilead `` is unique because most of it was written over the last 20 years .
All the other records , I 've written in a year or two or three after finishing the previous one .
This one has threads from many , many years . ''
She added that this R&B - flavored opener , `` which ended up being about my daughter , was started before -LRB- 1989 's -RRB- Flying Cowboys , and it was waiting all these years to finish .
For me , the album feels close to a debut , because the only time you ever have to spend all these years writing a song is your first record , right ? ''
