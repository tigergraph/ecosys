Massive Attack uses a variety of vocalists .
On this one it was Elizabeth Fraser , whose lyrics were inspired by the death of her one-time close friend , singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley .
The news that Buckley had drowned whilst swimming came while Fraser was recording this song .
`` That was so weird , '' she recalled to The Guardian in 2009 .
`` I 'd got letters out and I was thinking about him .
That song 's kind of about him - that 's how it feels to me anyway . ''
Fraser sang for The Cocteau Twins , worked on 3 tracks of Massive Attack 's Mezzanine album and contributed to the soundtrack of Lord of the Rings - Fellowship Of The King .
This won the 1998 MTV Europe Music Award for Best Video .
The song 's music video featured a plastic fetus in the womb , lip-synching the song .
3D told The Guardian : `` We kept the Teardrop baby but being made of old latex , it just does n't have the longevity .
It 's now just a primitive animatronic half-creature in a puddle of rotten latex .
It 's still quite scary : it 's like a museum piece , but for all the wrong reasons . ''
In 2007 the British singer-songwriter Newton Faulkner released a cover of this as a download only single , peaking at # 60 in the UK singles charts .
Part of this is used in the theme music for the Fox TV show House MD. .
Massive Attack 's Robert `` 3D '' Del Naja told The Guardian February 6 , 2010 that the band cut themselves out of a fortune with the licensing of this song to the show .
He explained : `` We got an email from Bryan Singer saying the entire concept of House was based on Teardrop .
We were flattered .
We let him have it . ''
Part of this song was used in season 1 of the TV program Prison Break .
