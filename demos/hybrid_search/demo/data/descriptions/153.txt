This uses a sample from Michael Jackson 's song Human Nature from his Thriller album .
Nas told Rolling Stone : `` That was one of the records that jump-started the commercial success for me on my first album , the Michael Jackson sample -LSB- ` Human Nature ' -RSB- .
That was my introduction to the world , my first official single , so I had to do that . ''
The video is a tribute to Wild Style , which was the first movie about Hip-Hop culture .
Nas shot some of the video on the same stage used in the final scene of the movie .
-LRB- thanks , Donovan Berry - El Dorado , AR , for above 2 -RRB-
