This dark and moody cut was included on the soundtrack of the third Twilight movie , Eclipse .
Florence Welch explained to The Independent June 11 , 2010 why she wanted to be involved .
`` I thought it would be something fun to do ; I 'd never written a song for a soundtrack before .
It 's an interesting exercise as a songwriter .
You 're thinking about it more in a visual tone and imagining a film score , which I think is really exciting.They did n't specifically say what bit of the movie it was going to be in or anything , but they did say it should have nothing about vampires or werewolves in it .
I do n't think they wanted anything with specific references to the story ; it 's not a musical , opera type thing -- they just wanted something that fitted the emotional tone of it .
I just thought about some of the themes in the book and wrote the song . ''
Welch was unaware of the huge demand to be on the Eclipse soundtrack .
When told how many bands submitted songs for it , she gasped , `` No way , really ?
Mental .
They would n't tell us for ages if it was on .
I did the song , they said they liked it and then only at the last minute did they say it was included . ''
Florence told The Independent that she is a fan of the Twilight books .
`` My sister and I read them to each other last Christmas .
It 's pure escapism .
We get really excited for the films , they 're fun . ''
