The title of British alternative dance band Friendly Fires ' second album Pala is a reference to the doomed utopia of English writer Aldous Huxley 's novel Island .
`` I like the idea of being in a paradise but ultimately knowing it 's all going to end , '' frontman Ed Macfarlane told Q magazine .
Macfarlane had some doubts about the track .
He told NME it was , `` the slowest track we 've ever done .
Very stripped down .
The drums are actually made of wind up toys and cameras rolling on film .
Your brain is thinking , ` This is good ' and then another part is thinking , ` But is it Friendly Fires ?
Is it dancey enough ? ' ''
Published in 1962 , Island was Huxley 's final book .
It is the account of Will Farnaby , a cynical journalist who is shipwrecked on the fictional island of Pala , where parrots whisper uplifting messages to the islanders .
A colorful parrot is featured on the cover of Pala .
`` We wanted to pinpoint it to something that 's key to what the record is about , and the parrot being on the cover is part of Huxley 's novel - there are parrots on the island of Pala who are trained to encourage people with uplifting messages .
So we thought ` Great - let 's do that for the cover , ' '' Macfarlane explained to NME .
