The title track of Mac Miller 's sophomore album finds him spitting about his wonderful lifestyle over a trippy beat .
`` Looking at my life is like you watching movies , '' Miller declares .
This is one of five tracks on Watching Movies with the Sound Off that was produced by Larry Fisherman , Mac Miller 's alter ego .
In this instance it was with the help of SAP , the guy behind the beat of `` Donald Trump . ''
Miller told MTV News ; `` On Blue Slide Park , the core of the album was everything that me and -LSB- Big Jerm -RSB- and -LSB- E-Dan -RSB- did , so we would sit and make the songs from scratch , but they would handle the production .
The only difference with this one is , I said , ` You know what ?
It 's time for me to step in and try this . ' ''
