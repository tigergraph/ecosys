In an MTV News interview , Chris Cornell said of this song : `` It 's a bunch of references to people that I knew that were younger than me who 've been dead for years and years , up to a couple of years ago .
And then just kind of that juxtaposition of , even though it seems a lot for one person , a young healthy person , to have lost all these friends through various means of stupidity and other things , then making reference to the Vietnam War Memorial and the sheer numbers of dead .
And remembering that and pointing out that each one of them has a family , each one of them has friends that are sitting around thinking about the same stuff that I did .
But the numbers are astounding and , in a sense , kind of criminal .
And that 's what the song 's about . ''
The music video for this song was shot during the band 's stay in Cuba .
They were the first American band to ever play a live show in the Communist nation of Cuba .
-LRB- thanks , Bert - Pueblo , NM , for all above -RRB- The bridge where Cornell sings , `` I 've seen 50,000 names all engraved on a stone '' is a reference to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C.
