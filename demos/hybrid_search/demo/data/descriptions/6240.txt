This ode to musicians selling out in commercials references various American corporate staples such as Chevy , Subway and Chevy .
Frontman Les Claypool explained to Artist Direct : `` I remember back in the day - maybe I 'm just becoming old -LSB- laughs -RSB- - but the rock 'n' roll guys were n't the ones pitching sodas and tennis shoes .
Now it surprises me just how quickly some of these people jump on the advertising bandwagon .
To me , you 're hauling your credibility out the window .
Years ago I was offered this commercial , and it was for a product I actually used and liked ... And I talked to Matt Stone -LSB- of South Park for which Primus penned the theme song -RSB- and a bunch of friends about it .
Matt said , ` Yeah , it 's a cool idea and you 'd probably do a good job at it , but whenever I see someone in one of these commercials I know they have a price . '
That 's the price they 'll do something for .
We all admire Tom Waits for various things , but I 've always admired him for speaking out against doing such things but also he 's taken people to court for using his material .
It just amazes me how some people will just roll over . ''
