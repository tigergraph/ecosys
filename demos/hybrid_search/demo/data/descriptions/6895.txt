This is a frivolous sounding song on a sometimes controversial subject , though in this case karma bites back , with the convicted rapist being sodomised by another inmate.Written in a fast 4/4 time by guitarist Brad Nowell , it appears to have been inspired by a joke at a party .
Although the message of the song is to be welcomed , Nowell would probably have done better to warn against a vice that is far more prevalent amongst rock musicians than rape .
On May 25 , 1996 he died from a heroin overdose aged only twenty-eight , leaving a widow and a son not quite one year old .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 3 -RRB- `` Date Rape '' was recorded by Nowell 's band Sublime for their 1992 debut album , but was n't released as a single until 1995 when it received a lot of airplay in their native California .
There appear to be two edits , a 3 minutes 37 seconds version and one running to 4 minutes 38 seconds .
