This is the third single to be lifted from Misha B 's debut album .
The track takes elements from The Fugees ' 1996 hit single `` Fu-Gee-La , '' which itself interpolates blue-eyed soul singer Teena Marie 's 1988 R&B single `` Ooo La La La. '' The music video was directed by Dava Cut and produced by Roger Ubina .
The clip , which features five specially trained gymnastic dancers and required 12 hours of rehearsals in ankle-deep water , was filmed February 24-26 , 2013 .
60 protective face masks were supplied for Misha B , the dancers and crew .
Misha told Digital Spy that Fugees singer Lauren Hill is one of her musical icons .
`` When I went in the studio the concept was already there , '' she said , `` and when we went to record it we kept coming back to that melody .
We were unsure whether to go with it or not but it felt right .
I would n't have gone with it if I was n't comfortable with it . ''
Misha B said of the song : '' ` Here 's To Everything -LRB- Ooh La La -RRB- ' , is a toast to life !
It 's a feel-good song celebrating everything life throws at you . ''
Misha B explained to Digital Spy : `` I 've always wanted to make a song that reflects my outlook on life , and this is basically it .
It 's all about celebrating those big moments in life . ''
