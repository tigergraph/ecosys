Night of Hunters is a 21st century song cycle in which American singer-songwriter Toro Amos tells the story of a woman who finds herself trying to understand why love has gone wrong for her .
One of the inspirations for the album was The White Goddess , Robert Graves ' essay on poetic myth making .
Thus , the female protagonist and a shape-shifting being named Annabelle journey back into the mythic past in her search for clues .
A peyote ritual , as explored on this track is a key part of the quest .
Amos told UK newspaper The Independent that she read Graves ' work again and again during the making of Night of Hunters .
`` The book assimilates different European myths and explains how they interact , '' she explained , `` so that was percolating in my brain . ''
The song finds Amos duetting with her 11-year-old daughter Natashya , and is based on Chopin 's `` Nocturne op. 9 no. 1 . ''
