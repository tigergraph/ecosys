Taylor penned this hushed , intimate number when she was sitting on her tour bus after a show thinking about a relationship that ended several months previously .
She explained to Billboard magazine : `` The feeling was n't sadness and anger or those things anymore .
It was wistful loss .
And so I just got my guitar and I hit on the fact that I was thinking in terms of rhyming ; I rhymed magic with tragic , changed a few things and ended it with what a sad beautiful tragic love affair .
I wanted to tell the story in terms of a cloudy recollection of what went wrong .
It 's kind of the murky gray , looking back on something you ca n't change or get back . ''
Red covers the whole spectrum of emotions and this cut lies at one end of the range .
`` I 'm 22 , '' Swift told Billboard magazine .
`` I 'm all over the place , so my record is all over the place .
Part of this record is acknowledging -LSB- that -RSB- all these emotions are very loud and very different from one another .
At one end of the spectrum you have ` Sad Beautiful Tragic , ' which is a breakup song in the form of a funeral march , and you also have ` Never Ever Getting Back Together Again ' , which is a breakup song in the form of a parade . ''
