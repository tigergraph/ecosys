The Wombats pulled the This Modern Glitch album title from this song , which finds singer Matthew Murphy reminiscing about , yep , 1996 .
He sings : `` But my self belief , my self belief , Was n't lost in the modern glitch . ''
`` Its about feeling quite lost and empty , '' Murphy explained Spin magazine : `` Perhaps its about structure and the idea that everything is mapped out for us from the word go . ''
The vocalist told The Sun the album title is about , `` inner conflict , something I think everyone feels , and something the three of us definitely felt making the album . ''
