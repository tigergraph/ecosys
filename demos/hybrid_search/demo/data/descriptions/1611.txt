Example wrote this song with Guy Chambers .
He told ILikeMusic about the collaboration with the former Robbie Williams songwriting partner : `` You go to his studio and there are just platinum discs everywhere , '' he said .
`` He 's sold millions and millions and millions .
I just went in and he said , ` Look , I want you to do all the words but I 've got this idea for a song .
Let 's start with the title Microphone and this line ' I do n't need no microphone , ' what does that mean to you ? '
So I worked out what that line meant to me and wrote a song .
All the melodies and lyrics were mine and he helped me tweak bits of it . ''
