This song tells the story of a middle class girl .
`` Bourgeois , why would you care for more ?
, '' sings Thomas Mars .
`` They give you almost everything , you believed almost anything . ''
The vocalist told Spin magazine this is one of a couple of songs on Bankrupt !
that examine `` the beauty of the fake . ''
The song title references the French word ` Bourgeoisie , ' which originally denoted the wealthy stratum of the middle class that originated during the latter part of the Middle Ages .
In time , the French term came to encompass both the upper and middles classes , whilst Socialists apply the word to the whole propertied class , as distinct from the proletariat .
In English , however , ` Bourgeoisie ' -LRB- and bourgeois -RRB- means the social class above the workers and peasants , and below the nobility .
The term has also acquired a contemptuous sense , implying commonplace , philistine respectability .
