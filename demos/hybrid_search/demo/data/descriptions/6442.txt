This is the title track of 2008 X Factor winner Alexandra Burke 's debut album .
Burke told BBC News that while she has n't written any of the songs on Overcome , the songs are , `` a reflection of my own personality . ''
She added : `` I 've kept a diary since 1999 and I walked in with a diary to the studio and I would read paragraphs of it to the producers and I would say , ` can we not sing about it , can we write about this , because it 's what I relate to ' . ''
This power ballad about meeting `` the one '' and being swept away was produced by Ryan Tedder , the man behind the previous season 's X Factor champion Leona Lewis ' Bleeding Love .
