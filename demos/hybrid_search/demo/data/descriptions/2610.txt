Former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger began work on her debut solo project in 2007 under the title Her Name Is Nicole .
Release of the album was pushed back throughout 2008 and 2009 before Scherzinger finally shelved the record citing bad timing and creative issues as the reasons for its cancellation .
She began re-recording the entire project in 2010 with a new title Killer Love in 2010 .
This ballad is a leftover from the Her Name Is Nicole sessions .
The song is a duet with English recording artist and former Police frontman , Sting .
Speaking of their collaboration , which took place with both singers in the same studio , Scherzinger told English newspaper The Sun : `` His energy is very commanding , in a subtle way .
He is giving , generous and kind .
I flew to Boston for his show with The Police .
I met him and he was everything and more than I thought .
I felt like we were doing yoga when we were singing .
He was such an easy guy to work with ... Singing on the same mic you are really close .
He had fresh breath .
No broccoli in the teeth . ''
