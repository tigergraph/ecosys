Frontman Gary Lightbody told the Irish public broadcaster RTE about this unusual love song with very dark and a twisted imagery : `` The lyric is self-explanatory , a love song , but the arrangement is unusual .
It started out with me on guitar and voice and then Jacknife -LRB- producer Garret ` Jacknife ' Lee -RRB- put these weird drums across it which meant sonically we could go places we 've never been before .
The thwack on the snare in the chorus is made by a giant plant . ''
Lightbody told The Sun October 17 , 2008 that this song was inspired from , `` listening to -LRB- English dubstep musician -RRB- Burial a lot and a lot of electronica in general . ''
