Between the release of her debut album My Paper Heart and its follow-up Hundred More Years , CCM singer-songwriter Francesca Battistelli married Christian band percussionist Matthew Goodwin and gave birth to her first child , Matthew Elijah .
The song talks about having a child and cherishing the precious moments , but Battistelli did n't plan it that way - she did n't even tell her co-writer she was pregnant .
In our 2011 interview with Francesca Battistelli , she said : `` It definitely is a good picture of when we got married , for sure .
But I wrote the song with Diane Glover when my husband and I were pregnant and we were n't telling people yet .
So the second verse about having a little girl - we had a little boy , now he 's 10 months .
But that was definitely in my head , too .
I wanted the song to go through someone 's life and talk about having your child , and so when it actually went there I was really excited .
Because I did n't tell them yet that we were pregnant , I told them after .
But I just wanted to see if we would go there naturally in the writing session .
And we did . ''
Battistelli chose to title her sophomore record after this tune , as she loved the song and felt it represented her life at the time .
`` It was such a great picture of my life right now of learning to cherish the little moments and realize how fast life goes by , '' she told us .
`` Because having a child , as you know , makes time speed up .
It 's like , how did six months go by so fast ? ''
