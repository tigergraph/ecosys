This funky R&B number was written during a trip to Los Angeles when Bailey Rae contributed some songs including `` Take Your Time '' and `` Stay With Me -LRB- By The Sea -RRB- '' to soul legend Al Green 's 2008 album Lay It Down .
Bailey Rae worked with drummer Ahmir `` Questlove '' Thompson and keyboard player James Poyser of The Roots on this song , which she named after The Black Lily , a night that Thompson used to run on Sundays .
She explained : `` He 'd get a chef to come to his house , and Jill Scott and Erykah Badu and the rest of The Roots would come along .
All the Philadelphia scene would jam and hang out and have food .
I thought , I 'd love to be a part of a community like that .
Am I part of a scene like that , or do I feel a bit on my own ?
And I just liked the image of the blackest lily . ''
