This is a tribute to a soul food restaurant Jim Morrison ate at on Venice Beach called Olivia 's .
Morrison often stayed too late at Olivia 's , where he liked the food because it reminded him of home and warmed his `` soul . ''
They often kicked him out so they can close , thus lines like : `` let me sleep all night , in your soul kitchen . ''
`` Soul Kitchen '' as a restaurant title , would have of course referred to `` soul food . ''
That 's a traditional kind of cuisine popular with African Americans of the mid-20th century , named in harmony with other `` soul '' affectations .
Soul food usually revolved around ham -LRB- cuts like hog 's feet and hog jowls -RRB- , beans , okra , hushpuppies , cornbread , collard greens , and other one-offs of standard American fair .
The idea is to that the food is both economical and very filling .
People in colder climates -LRB- from any culture -RRB- may also find soul food comforting in the heart of winter , since you 're going to burn all those calories shoveling snow anyway .
He is not credited on the album , but Larry Knetchel was brought in to play bass .
The Doors usually did not use a bass player , but producer Paul Rothchild felt this needed it .
Jim Morrison sang lead and harmony .
His vocals were overdubbed .
In terms of time length , at 3 min .
35 seconds , this song is the second-longest on The Doors ' debut album .
With the longest , of course , being `` The End . ''
According to the Greil Marcus book The Doors : A Lifetime of Listening to Five Mean Years , `` Soul Kitchen '' was The Doors ' own `` Gloria , '' comparing the steady climb toward a looming chorus .
It also quotes Paul Williams ' May 1967 article in Crawdaddy !
opining that it was more comparable to `` Blowin ' in the Wind , '' in that both songs have a message , but the message of `` Soul Kitchen '' is of course `` learn to forget .
`` Meanwhile , John Densmore 's book Riders on the Storm : My Life with Jim Morrison and the Doors declares that the title restaurant Olivia 's was a `` small soul food restaurant at the corner of Ocean Park and Main . ''
The author describes a meal there with Morrison , commenting that the restaurant `` belonged in Biloxi , Mississippi '' and resembled `` an Amtrak dining car that got stranded on the beach '' and was packed with UCLA film students .
Another famous diner was Linda Ronstadt .
This song was used as part of the soundtrack to the 1994 blockbuster film Forrest Gump and in the 2003 documentary Mayor of the Sunset Strip .
The song `` I 'm a Tree '' by alternative Hip-Hop artist Imani Coppola samples this song , and Coppola 's song appears in many more film and TV episode soundtracks .
The punk rock band X released a cover of this song on their 1980 album Los Angeles .
