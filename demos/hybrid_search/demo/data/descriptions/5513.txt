This electro-disco track about a lover who gives , `` such sweet nothing , '' features the vocals of Florence Welch from Florence + the Machine .
The singer previously linked up with Harris when his remix of her Ceremonials track , `` Spectrum '' shot to the top of the UK singles chart .
The song was premiered on Chris Moyle 's BBC Radio 1 breakfast show on August 28 , 2012 .
When this debuted at # 1 on the UK singles chart it broke a run of second place finishes for Calvin Harris , as his previous four singles as lead artist had all stalled at # 2 .
This was the first single that Welch had sung on that reached the top 10 of the Hot 100 .
Her previous best chart ranking had been the # 21 position of her own group 's Florence + the Machine 's `` Dog Days Are Over '' in 2010 .
The Vincent Haycock directed video was filmed over two days in a Working Men 's Club in Dalston , London .
It features Welch as a singer in a small , dingy , Serbian nightclub .
Surrounded by a violent life and fearful of her future , Florence unleashes a ferocious performance .
Regarding the 18 Months album title , Harris explained : `` It was a mixture between 18 months studio time and gigs and also it was kind of a point when I stopped performing in a certain way with a band and singing all the time and ... just focused on production and Djing .
So it made sense to draw that line there and it just happened to be 18 months before I finished the album . ''
Calvin Harris was named as the most successful songwriter in the UK singles chart in 2012 .
As well as a string of hits from his 18 Months album , Harris also penned several big sellers for other artists including Call My Name by Cheryl Cole and Rihanna 's `` We Found Love . ''
