Credited to Rauch , Rolie and Santana , this splendiferous guitar instrumental which runs to 3 minutes 54 seconds segues from the opening track of the Caravanserai album .
According to Simon Leng in Soul Sacrifice : The Santana Story , this `` is where the emotional action cuts in , with a simple two-chord concept , startling time signature shifts and intense percussion .
Most noticeable was the sound and performance of Santana 's guitar which hits the listener with a more refined brand of passion , a clear advance in technical control and a less blues-based , more horn-like tone . ''
`` Waves Within '' segues into `` Look Up -LRB- To See What 's Coming Down -RRB- '' .
