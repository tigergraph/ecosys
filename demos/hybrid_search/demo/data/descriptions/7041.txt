This song is about an older man who falls in love with a younger woman , but then leaves her .
It could certainly parallel some of Mick Jagger 's relationships , including his affair with model Jerry Hall .
In promotional materials for the album , Jagger said : `` Of course , you are as vulnerable as anyone else .
It 's crazy to think someone ca n't be hurt just because he 's famous or he struts across a stage .
If you go back through Stones albums , I 'm sure you 'll find vulnerability along with the swagger .
It may not have been as easy to see , though , because it 's not my temperament to share that feeling .
I 've often hid my feelings with humor .
This time the songs were written very quickly , and I was in a certain frame of mind .
I thought about some of the words afterward to see whether they were too personal , but I decided to just let them stay .
Keith was very encouraging ... Translating that vulnerability into a song is very cathartic for you .
You have to write it down and examine it and decide what you wanted to share .
There 's something in the process that helped me get past the hurt it .
`` Keith Richards added : `` I thought it was about time -LRB- Mick -RRB- owned up and stepped out of that closed shell .
I know he went through bad periods , even if he did n't want to write about it .
I used to wrestle with that too .
As a writer , you do n't want to bore people with your own story .
But you eventually realize that you 're not the only one who is lonely or having problems . ''
