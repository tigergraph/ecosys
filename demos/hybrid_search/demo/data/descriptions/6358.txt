This song finds a father trying to help his son as he struggles to find life 's meaning .
Escovedo explained to Express Night Out that he penned this for his own discontent son : '' ` Down in the Bowery ' is a song I wrote for my son who is 18 and an angry young man , very quiet , very much into his music , -LSB- with -RSB- very strong opinions about his music as to why he likes it .
He 's always been that way since he was a little boy .
I love my son very much .
-LSB- He 's a -RSB- graffiti artist , a drummer and singer in a punk rock band .
I 'm very proud of him .
The song kind of encourages him to be who he wants to be , and that I will always have his back as a result of my love for him . ''
Ian Hunter contributes full-throated vocals to this song .
Escovedo explained that he owes a lot to the former Mott the Hoople singer .
`` No one ever told me those things when I was a kid growing up , except for Ian Hunter in his songs .
His songs were really my only kind of parental advice , in a way .
So to have him sing on it is really beautiful .
I 'm kind of passing this knowledge on to my son within the song .
It 's almost generational in a way . ''
