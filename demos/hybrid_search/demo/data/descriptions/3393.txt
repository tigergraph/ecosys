This is Christina Aguilera 's first single from her fourth studio album , Bionic .
The song , which is referred to as a `` fiercely energetic anthem '' in press releases , was written by Ester Dean and produced by Polow Da Don -LRB- Chris Brown , Usher , Fergie -RRB- .
American singer-songwriter Ester Dean 's other credits include Rihanna 's chart-topper `` Rude Boy , '' `` Sex Therapy '' for Robin Thicke and her own Hot 100 hit , `` Drop It Low . ''
Polow Da Don , who also co-penned the track , told Billboard magazine : `` This song was just me and Ester freestyling one day as another friend of mine was jumping and dancing around the studio .
Christina 's people reached out and asked if I had anything hot for her .
I sent this , which happened to fit the fresh , different angle Christina told me she wanted to hit people with on this album . ''
The video contains a deliberate tribute to Madonna .
Aguilera told Q Magazine : `` One of my favorite videos ever is ` Express Yourself ' by Madonna which came across as really strong and empowering which I always try to incorporate through my expression of sexuality .
I love the direct reference I made to Madonna with the eye glass moment and the smoke and stairs .
I was paying tribute to a very strong woman who has paved the way before . ''
According to publicity materials , the title Bionic reflects Aguilera 's `` ability to take her range to new levels and use her voice in various ways never heard before . ''
The singer described the album , which was recorded in her home studio , as a mix of many genres and styles of music .
`` I was able to explore and create a fresh , sexy feel using both electronic and organic elements with subject matter ranging from playful to introspective , '' she said .
The song 's music video was directed by Hype Williams , who also helmed Lady Gaga 's graphic clip for `` Telephone . ''
The clip was shot from April 7-9 , 2010 in Los Angeles .
Motherhood apparently has n't tamed Aguilera as in the racy video the singer is seen clad in various sexy lingerie and dominatrix gear .
`` It 's a very sexy video , '' she told US Weekly .
`` It was about different facets of being ` Not Myself ' . ''
She added concerning her young son , `` Max came to see me during our tame scenes .
He loved it , he really likes the song and says , ` let 's get kway-zee ! ' ''
