The Real Thing was recorded in the wake of Scott 's divorce from artist and DJ Lyzel Williams .
The album featured songs about the breakdown of a broken marriage .
This track was described by Scott as `` an ode to loneliness that can exist inside a marriage when you are staying in the marriage purely for the sake of staying in the marriage . ''
