Currington told AOL the story of this song : `` I wrote this song with two of my favorite writers , Mark Nesler and Tony Martin , and it was a title that Tony had had for quite some time .
We were all just throwing out different titles that day , and that was one that just kind of stood out for us .
And it was real simple .
We just thought about everything , where I was at that point in my life , which was how we came up with the first line of that song , and it just went from there .
The melody developed on its own , and everything just kind of fell into place . ''
