`` Johnny Come Home '' was the Fine Young Cannibals ' first single from their debut album .
The song follows the story of a runaway who learns the harsh reality of a life on the streets .
The title refers to his parents ' desperate plea for him to come home and was likely inspired by the 1975 TV documentary about London runaways , Johnny Go Home : The Murder of Billy Two-Tone .
This song was featured in the thrillers Someone to Watch Over Me -LRB- 1987 -RRB- and The Handmaid 's Tale -LRB- 1990 -RRB- .
Roland Gift revealed the song 's original premise in a Q&A with The Rebel Magazine in 2011 : '' ` Johnny ' started off about being black in a white man 's world , but it evolved into something more inclusive and better . ''
British author Jake Arnott used this title for his 2006 novel about about the Glam-Rock period in early '70s London .
FYC made their television debut performing this song on The Tube , an influential UK music series that introduced an array of future hitmakers , in 1984 .
It was an important move for the group , who had previously been turned down by nearly every major record label .
Shortly after their appearance on the program , they were offered a deal with London Records .
