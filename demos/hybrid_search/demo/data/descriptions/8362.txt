Micheal Stipe calls this his `` Leonard Cohen copy , '' due to his unusually dark vocal range and cynical lyrics .
In 1991 R.E.M. covered Cohen 's hit `` First We Take Manhattan '' for his tribute album I 'm Your Fan .
While this is the only song on Monster where a computer was used , the drum part was actually played by a `` real '' instrument and not by a drum machine , like it appears to be .
