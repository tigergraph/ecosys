Guitarist Gary Rossington -LRB- from Classic Rock magazine -RRB- : `` That song has a lot of guitars that interlock with each other and play different parts ; that 's what we used to do .
Allen would have a part , I would have a part and Ed King , or Steve Gaines , would have a part , and when we put them all together they would just have that sound .
Ronnie would put lyrics to it and his voice would make the song .
We started doing that again with this album .
We decided to do that once again , instead of all of us just playing the same thing , over and over . ''
