This is the lead single from Christian pop punk band Stellar Kart 's fourth album , Everything is Different Now .

It was released in retail stores the following February .
This song was originally the title track of a 2007 album by Georgia-based Christian rock and Contemporary worship music band Fee .
Agee explained that Stellar Kart 's cover reflects the band 's foremost desire to glorify God .
He said : `` As a band , that 's exactly what we want to do in front of the adults , kids , anyone listening -- shine .
We hope that everyone will shine his/her light and not be afraid or ashamed of what they believe . ''
Frontman Adam Agee commented in publicity materials that rather than focusing on more relational matters , on Everything is Different Now the material has more of a worshipful flavor .
He explained this is a return to the band 's roots .
`` We had performed at a camp earlier in the summer before recording , and we really discovered that we loved leading worship for youth again , '' he said .
`` So we tried to find some of the songs that were our favorites and wrote a few new songs , too , and that eventually became Everything is Different Now . ''
