The xx approached the writing for Coexist in a different way than their self-titled debut release .
Singer-guitarist Romy Madley Croft and singer-bassist Oliver Sim developed the lyrics and melody live together , rather than exchanging emails , before involving DJ-producer Jamie Smith earlier in the songwriting process .
This new method produced dividends with this song , which was penned towards the end of the recording for the album .
`` Oliver and I just wrote together in a room , '' Croft recalled to Spin magazine : `` I playing keyboard in the basement and we just wrote , it just kind of happened .
And we discussed the song , and it grew in interesting ways that never have existed if we 'd written solely through e-mail .
When we came to Jamie and played it to him live , he started playing along and brought a rhythmic twist that I would have never have thought of .
It really happened very organically . ''
The cymbals at the start of this song are sampled from The Crusaders ' `` Lilies of the Nile , '' a track from their 1974 album , Southern Comfort .
`` The actual vinyl that I sampled it off was my parents record , '' explained Smith to Mojo magazine .
`` I 've been listening to it as long as I remember .
We could have replayed it and not had it to pay The Crusaders , but I wanted it because it has a history and meaning . ''
