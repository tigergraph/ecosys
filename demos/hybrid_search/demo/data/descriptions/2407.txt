This midtempo country jam finds Lauren taking a stand against a boy , who takes advantages of girls .
Country singer-songwriter Sarah Johns wrote the song with Nashville tunesmiths Tom Shapiro and Tony Martin .
Lauren told Taste of Country about this cut : `` This song takes the boy who thinks he is ` the stuff ' and throws him under the bus .
It tells him he 's not that great .
There are lots of guys out there who think they are just awesome and they hurt girls ' feelings and make them feel like they 're not good enough for them .
This song is a good representation of that girl finally saying , ` Listen pal , you are n't good enough for me . ' ''
