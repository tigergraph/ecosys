This is the opening track from Ursa Major , the fourth studio album by American alternative rock band Third Eye Blind and their first long player for six years .
This song was written during the last year of the George W. Bush presidency .
Frontman Stephen Jenkins explained to Alternative Addiction that it `` is really this song of hope and yet like many Americans I was opposed to the Bush regime . ''
He added : `` Eight years of hell whereby America had ideas and then when someone crashed some planes into those buildings in New York it was a chance for them to cash in those ideas .
America really stood for liberty and freedom and in eight years it sort of forgot that and it became about security .
Can You Take Me looked to the future in the hope that we could get back to that . ''
