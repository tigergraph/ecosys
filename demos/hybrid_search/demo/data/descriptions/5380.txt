This song features Aimee Mann 's stripped down , soulful style of songwriting , reminiscent of Joni Mitchell 's Blue album .
The lyrics are like a short story , with the narrator telling the tale of feeling jaded and `` sold down the river '' at the giant holiday celebration that happens every summer in the United States : Independence Day , the fourth of July .
A crisp recording of this song is featured in the 2010 live concert film Live at St. Ann 's Warehouse .
