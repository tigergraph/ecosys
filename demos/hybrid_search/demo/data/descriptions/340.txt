In an interview with Lazy-I , lead singer Will Sheff said : `` There were these murder cases in Austin where these two girls were working in a yogurt shop and these three college guys went to rob the place and killed and mutilated them .
I worked for the state at the time and heard the details they did n't report - how they cut them open and filled them with frozen yogurt .
They caught one of the kids that did it , and there he was , on TV , and I remember my co-workers looking at him and looking at him for the evil on his face .
You wanted to see the evil , but it was n't there . ''
