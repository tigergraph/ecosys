Back in the days before the Gin Blossoms had realized their eventual colossal success , band member Jesse Valenzuela was in a little bar in downtown Tempe , Arizona , with his buddies , trying to think of the `` most horrendous country titles '' they could come up with .
`` And my buddy Ricky came up with that one , '' says Jesse . ''
` You ca n't call it cheatin ' cuz she reminds me of you . '
The song pretty much wrote itself .
`` Co-written with fellow Gin Blossom Doug Hopkins , Jesse tells a story about how they were at a radio station one day for an interview .
`` It was a lady DJ , '' recalls Jesse , `` I forgot who she was .
But she goes , ` I 'd like to say I love that song , because it 's so funny .
But I do find it mildly offensive at the same time . ''
