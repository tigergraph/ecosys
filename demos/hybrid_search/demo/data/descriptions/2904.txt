This single by Scottish musician Rustie features vocals from Aluna Francis of AlunaGeorge .
Francis told Coup De Main magazine that it was one of the trickiest collaborations she 's done .
`` We thought the song was perfect as an instrumental , so when Rustie came to us and asked us to do a vocal we were like : ` Oh my god , how do we do this without ruining the song ?
, '' she explained .
`` It really was a taste of using my voice as an instrument .
We basically settled on something that we did n't think would totally destroy the music , so it was a delicate operation - like surgery !
Like grafting on an extra ... where would you put someone 's third boob without it looking really weird , you know ? ''
The song featured on an Adidas advert prior to the 2012 Olympic Games featuring British heptathlete Jessica Ennis and was also included on the soundtrack to the video game Sleeping Dogs .
