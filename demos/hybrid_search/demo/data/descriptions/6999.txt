We all love to hear tales of people returning from the brink , and this tune by Californian singer-songwriter Brett Dennen tells the story of a person reviving their fortunes .
He told Spinner UK what inspired this song : `` I just wanted to tell the story of a comeback .
Everybody has one in them .
Everybody knows how it feels to be down and out and wanting to be back on top . ''
Baseball fan Dennen got to film the video at the Oakland Athletics stadium .
He told Spinner UK how it happened : `` The Oakland Athletics reached out to my manager and asked if I was interested in doing something with them at a game .
They were aware that I am a fan .
They thought it would be fun for me to sing ` Take Me Out To The Ballgame , ' which I quickly said yes to , because it 's always been a dream of mine .
We came up with the idea to shoot the music video , because at the time , we were in the process of coming up with a story for the music video .
Thankfully they agreed , and they and Major League Baseball were very generous with us and allowed us to pretty much use whatever footage we shot . ''
