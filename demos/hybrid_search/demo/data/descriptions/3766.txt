Zola Jesus is the stage name of the Russian American singer/songwriter Nika Roza Danilova .
She was raised in Merrill , Wisconsin on over 100 acres of forest and started singing early on , buying voice lesson tapes and opera sheet music at the age of 7 .
Danilova started performing opera when she was 10 years old , and in her teens she started to experiment in a more rock-orientated format .
She said that by adopting a stage name after Jesus Christ and the French writer Ã‰mile Zola , she consciously wanted to alienate her peers .
Danilova released her debut full-length album The Spoils in 2009 , while studying at the University of Wisconsin-Madison .
This track from her third album , Conatus , is named after the Japanese phenomenon of young people who can no longer cope with the demands of the outside world , and so go into self-imposed exile by shutting themselves in their apartments for years at a time .
Danilova told NME : `` It was about how , if I never left my house or my room , that 'd be just fine by me . ''
