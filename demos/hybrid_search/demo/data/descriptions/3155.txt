This was the first song the Lady Antebellum trio wrote together , and after it was released , Dave Haywood of the group said it was their favorite to perform live , telling Country Stars Central : `` That first song we wrote called `` All We Ever Need '' is probably our favorite to perform .
It 's just a big moment .
I play the Piano , Charles -LRB- Kelley -RRB- and Hillary -LRB- Scott -RRB- duet .
They have battling vocal parts back and forth on it .
It 's an emotional song about a first love , and a lost love . ''
