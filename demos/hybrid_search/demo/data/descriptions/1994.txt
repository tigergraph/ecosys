Chad Wolf is the lead singer and principal songwriter of the Swedish-American pop/rock band , Carolina Liar .
He explained in publicity materials that this song is about passion .
Said Wolf : `` You know what you 're living for , but what is it you 'll die for ?
Why is it so important for you to have coffee every day , would you die for that cup of coffee ?
It 's one of the prevailing themes on this record -- where 's the passion ? ''
Wolf told Sound Screen : `` My songs all come from real stories .
They 're all co-written , so I 'll write the stories and we 'll bring in a co-writer to nail it down . ''
He added that this song `` was co-written by Peter Svensson from The Cardigans .
It took us two weeks to write the song , line-by-line , wanting to make sure that the lyrics were really something we could believe in years later .
I always wonder how The Who feel now singing that line ' I hope I die before I get old ' . ''
