This is built around a sped-up sample from `` If We Ca n't Be Lovers '' by Prince Phillip Mitchell and also samples Chuck D from Public Enemy 's `` Bring The Noise . ''
Kanye West explained to concreteloop.com about this song : `` I had an interview with Wendy Williams and it really touched me that , like when she even said the title of the song she started crying .
Just saying that that song just touched her in that way .
And I really thought about the lyrics and what I was saying and it really would relate to her .
-LSB- he starts rapping parts of `` Everything I Am '' -RSB- You know , I was picturing , my muse for the song was kinda like , a little girl in High School or in grammar school getting picked on .
Like she gets picked on for being too skinny or something and she grows up to be a model .
Or she is getting picked on for being too big and grows up to be Oprah Winfrey or a journalist or something like that .
So just saying like , all these things that made you not cool when you was growing up , it 's almost like having a handicap .
You know what I 'm saying ?
You know if someone is blind , you can end up being Stevie Wonder because your ears are that much better . ''
Kanye West claims at the beginning of this song that the Hip-Hop artist Common passed on this .
