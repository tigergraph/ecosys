This song was inspired by the British producer Rupert Hine .
In the liner notes of her TimeSpace album , Nicks explained : `` The night I met Rupert Hine was a dangerous one .
He was different from anyone else I had ever known .
He was older , and he was smarter , and we both knew it .
I hired him to do the album before we even started talking about music .
It seemed that we had made a spiritual agreement to do a magic album ... in a fabulous Dutch castle , at the top of the mountain .
We recorded it in the formal dining room where upon the walls hung all these very old and expensive pieces of art - looking at us - we were never alone .
It always seemed to me that whenever Rupert walked into one of these old , dark castle rooms , that the rooms were on fire .
There was a connection between us that everyone around us instantly picked up on , and everyone was very careful to respect our space ... our ` TimeSpace , ' so we all lived at the castle for about four-and-a-half months .
I went home with him to England to mix the album at his studio - he left in December .
I joined him there in London in January .
He left immediately for his studio , Farmyard Studios , somewhere outside London .
It was like being in a cottage in Wales , it was a little spooky .
The atmosphere was like nothing I had ever experienced .
Then something happened to him that simply made it impossible for us to ever be together again .
I left him there ... the rooms were still burning , but the fire had been stolen from us .
It was n't over love .
In fact , it had nothing to do with love .
It was just a bad situation .
I came back to Los Angeles , a very changed woman .
And now , long nets of white cloud my memory .
Now I remember the rooms , the music , and how truly magic the whole thing was ... ` Alright , said Alice , I 'm going back ... To the other side of the mirror . ''
What price love ... What price glory ... ' ''
