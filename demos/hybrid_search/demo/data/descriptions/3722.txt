`` Reprogrammed to Hate '' is a great example of lead singer Phil Bozeman 's more personal lyrics .
It describes the dark , self-loathing mindset that he sank into thanks to an abusive stepfather during his teenage years .
`` I let my stepfather essentially reprogram my mind to be something I was n't , '' Bozeman said to Kill the Music .
`` This is me speaking to him and him speaking to me . ''
The song came out on 2010 's A New Era of Corruption .
The band 's third full-length release was noted for its extremely dark themes , most of them based on personal events in Bozeman 's life .
Bozeman said to SMN News that he `` usually writes about whatever is on my mind at the time and it 's usually a negative aspect of my life or just life in general .
It 's easier just to get whatever is on your mind and put in on paper . ''
He also noted that it 's easier to write lyrics once he 's heard the song , rather than the other way around , because the mood of the song can help him shape the feelings he 's trying to articulate .
The song features a guest appearance from Chino Moreno of The Deftones .
