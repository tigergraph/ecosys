This summer anthem was released as the second single from Big Dreams and High Hopes .
The song was written by Country music artist Rhett Akins along with Dallas Davidson and Ben Hayslip .
Akins told The Boot that this song was initially inspired by his feet .
He explained : `` We were sitting around trying to come up with ideas .
I 'd kicked my flip-flops off , and I was sitting there just staring at my feet .
Dallas was like , ` Man , we need a cool title - something that stands out ! '
When he said that , I was like , ` My feet look pretty interesting !
-LSB- laughs -RSB- How about something about feet -- barefoot or bare feet ? '
I think I said , ` Barefoot and Wild . '
Dallas said , ` How about ` Barefoot and Crazy ' ? '
As soon as he said that , we just started taking off on the song . ''
Ingram told Nashville 's Tennessean newspaper why this song was released in time for the summer season : `` I never thought I would say that because I always thought , ` What 's `` summer music '' ? '
But , it 's the playful hopefulness of what summer can bring , getting barefoot and crazy and having a good time and letting it all hang out for a while . ''
