A duet with 50 Cent , this song talks about what they had to overcome to achieve their success .
This is evidenced in the video , which shows the rappers as kids growing up in tough neighborhoods .
The line , `` Pac is gone , and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage '' is a reference to the Tupac song `` Brenda 's Got A Baby . ''
This uses a sample from `` Rubber Band '' by the Disco group The Trammps .
This was reworked as a duet with Mary J. Blige as `` MVP '' for her album The Breakthrough .
