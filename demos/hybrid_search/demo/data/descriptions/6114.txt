Most definitely not to be confused with the Irving Berlin standard of the same name , this album track is actually quite an uptempo number .
Although basically a blues based ego trip for lead guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and keyboard wizard Jon Lord , vocalist Ian Gillan also chips in on harmonica.The song 's most noticeable feature is its riff , the words are largely superfluous : You 're lazy , just stay in bed , You 're lazy , just stay in bed , You do n't want no money , You do n't want no bread.Etc .
`` Lazy '' was co-written by all five members of Deep Purple Mark II -LRB- ie Blackmore , Gillan , Glover , Lord and Paice -RRB- ; group compositions being a trademark of this particular line up.The studio version runs to 7 minutes 23 seconds and was recorded for the Machine Head sessions at Montreaux , Switzerland in December 1971 .
Being a track that lends readily to improvisation - as well as the aforementioned ego tripping - on stage it would often be spun out for considerably longer .
A quarter of a century after it was released , Ritchie Blackmore 's `` Lazy '' guitar solo was voted number 75 of all time by a readers ' poll for Guitar World magazine .
-LRB- thanks , Alexander Baron - London , England , for above 2 -RRB-
