John Grant closes his second solo album , Pale Green Ghosts , with this track where he describes how the pain of homophobia distorts one 's emotional landscape .
`` It 's interesting to watch the young gays these days , because they 're so much less afraid in general , but there are still huge communities where it 's not OK at all , '' he told The Observer , adding that it is `` the song that I wish I would have heard when I was a teenager . ''
Grant was living in Iceland when he recorded the album .
This song was inspired by a 10 hour drive the west coast to the east coast of the island during the Easter of 2012 .
`` I saw a lot of glaciers on the way , '' he told The Independent .
`` And I thought about them as a metaphor for how pain carves a path in you , but can also result in a new landscape . ''
