Singer Guy Garvey -LRB- from Drowned in Sound -RRB- : `` This was written in a little house in France , I remember my sister coming to visit , and walking up the country lane with her from the local village .
Lyrically it 's simple ; just telling a friend , who 's worried about an imminent child arriving , that everything will be fine . ''
Elbow 's co-songwriter and bass player Pete Turner told Uncut magazine that this is his personal favorite track on Seldom Seen Kid .
He explained : `` I can remember writing it on a beautiful Winter 's day in a small house in France .
I think it 's an area in our music we do well . ''
