Many believe that in this song 50 Cent is taking shots at the rapper T.I. .
The general consensus is that the Atlanta MC is being called a snitch for emerging from gun possessions charges with a lighter than expected jail sentence .
However 50 Cent denied the song is an explicit diss against T.I. .
He explained to MTV News : `` It 's like CSI : You use real-life situations to create something that 's entertaining without being specific .
When have you known me to be indirect with an issue ?
If I had a problem with any artist , trust me , they would know .
I take -LSB- that situation -RSB- , and I write that because a lot of people think that .
They 're not saying it because they 're cowardly people .
When you write it and put it there and leave and say , ` Let me watch and see what happens . '
There 's so much controversy around it , and you did n't say anything .
Then you go , ` See , they think that . '
They just wo n't say it to him because they 're a bunch of punks .
`` 50 Cent was then asked directly if the `` him '' he was referring to is T.I. .
He replied : '' -LSB- It 's -RSB- absolutely for the public to decide .
My intentions - you know me , you know my MO - I would just say something .
It 's not really directed at him .
It 's me taking real-life situations .
These things are relevant to hip-hop , period .
I make something that 's interesting enough for people to sink their teeth into , and I move forward . ''
