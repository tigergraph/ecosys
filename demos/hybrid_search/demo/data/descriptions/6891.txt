This is the debut single released by New York-based Indie Rock band American Authors .
The song is an optimistic track about keeping your chin up .
The band explained to Marley 's Musicality how the tune came about .
`` 2012 was a very intense year for everyone , '' they said .
`` It was a very violent year .
Sandy struck us really hard in our home of New York City .
There was a lot to devastating things that happened .
We decided to be optimistic about the new year .
For ` Believer ' there was really no formula in mind .
We were all in the room where we write and we were playing around on a guitar , and then someone started to play a really happy fun riff .
We added some banjo and then someone chimed in with a melody .
The rest came very organically . ''
Lead vocalist Zac Barnett recalled to American Songwriter magazine : `` When we wrote that , we wanted to do something completely fun and upbeat .
James -LRB- Shelley , guitar -RRB- had just found a banjo under his girlfriend 's bed like two days before that , so he actually learned banjo for that song . ''
