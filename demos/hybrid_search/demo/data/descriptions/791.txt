This is the international lead single from the self-titled debut album by Alternative Country band Mt. Desolation .
The group is the side project of Keane 's Tim Rice-Oxley and the English band 's live bassist Jesse Quin .
Jesse Quin explained to CMU how the pair penned the tracks for Mt. Desolation : `` Tim and I both wrote a bunch of songs and recorded demos of them that made it to various stages of completion .
Then everyone set up a load of drums and amps and stuff at Eastcote in London during those snowy few weeks last January and off we went .
That 's pretty much all there was to it , I guess .
Again , I ca n't speak for Tim but it 's only when I listened back to the finished article that I realised how much had really gone into the songs lyrically and melodically.The actual recording was very emotionally charged too because there was n't a lot of overdubbing so I personally felt like we all got into the moment a lot more .
It 's pretty rare that you get covered in sweat in a recording studio .
We just started playing and did n't stop until we got kicked out when the engineer wanted to go home .
It was pure joy . ''
