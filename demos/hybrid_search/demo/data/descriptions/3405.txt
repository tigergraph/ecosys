Frontman and lyricist Chad Gray told Artist Direct that the work that producer Dave Fortman did on this track explains why after he produced Lost and Found in 2005 , they got him to helm The New Game .
Explained Grey : `` The instrument separation that he comes up with is amazing , and it allows the song just to be .
Especially like you 're talking about -- listening to the music on headphones -- you can pick one instrument and listen to it through the whole song .
It 's right there in your face , and it 's almost like you can reach out and touch it .
That 's f -- kin ' Dave Fortman .
That 's his production skill and style .
He 's a fifth member really .
Dave is the f -- kin ' Bob Rock of our band -LSB- Laughs -RSB- -- without all the extra bullshit that came with that .
He 's really diplomatic .
He 's a really rad guy .
He brings a lot to the table for sure . ''
Gray told Artist Direct that this song 's classic rock vibe demonstrates the way Mudvayne are evolving .
He explained : `` The thing about those types of songs too is that people think that we 're really getting away from L.D. 50 and stuff like that , being the ` math metal ' band that we were dubbed or whatever .
I do n't know if it was self-proclaimed or what .
If you listen to the rhythms within the music , it 's still f -- kin ' whacky .
We 've just gotten slicker about how we do things .
We can transition better from part to part .
The rhythms are still really weird .
The chord structures are really odd .
The picking patterns on that song alone are ridiculous .
They 're awesome . ''
