This song is about a boy whose girlfriend recently broke up with him .
It tells of his progression in getting over her : 6 days and he 's still fully in love and thinking about her constantly .
Six weeks and he 's pretending to be OK because then maybe fiction will become reality .
Six months and he almost forgot about her until they played a song that reminded him or her and then he remembered her all over again .
The chorus is about how lost in love with her he is again and he ca n't seem to stop falling for her .
