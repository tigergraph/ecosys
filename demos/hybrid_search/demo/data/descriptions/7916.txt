Animal Bar is a a place in Australia close to where Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea was born .
In the song they talk about what you see when you 're there .
-LRB- thanks , derek - Appleton , WI -RRB- John Frusciante on the guitar work of the song : `` The main part is done with volume-knob swells , a wah , and a chorus pedal , but I used the wah pedal exactly the opposite of how it 's normally used .
I raise the volume while the wah is in the full treble position , and then close the wah to its full bass position .
Then I lower the volume and repeat the move on the next chord .
It 's unusual for a guitarist to use a wah that way , but it is the way a synthesist would think .
The chorus effect is maxed at some points , as is the Holy Grail , which is set to the Spring sound .
The solo is processed with the stereo phasing effect from the Analogue Systems Phaser . ''
