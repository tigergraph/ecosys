This reflective tune finds Bon Iver frontman Justin Vernon contemplating young love and a loss of innocence .
`` I was unafraid , I was a boy , I was a tender age , '' he croons in his trademark falsetto .
Vernon explained the song 's meaning to Qmagazine : `` It 's about the things you ca n't do any more .
So if you do you 'll be sent to West Michigan for ever . ''
-LRB- In other words - Hell -RRB- .
Bon Iver consists of 10 songs , each of them named after or describing a place .
Vernon has said in interviews that not all of the places are geographical locations so much as sentiments or states of being .
We can not find any place named Michicant in the Songfacts gazetteer so maybe it 's a play on words of ` Michigan ' as in ` Michica n't ' ?
