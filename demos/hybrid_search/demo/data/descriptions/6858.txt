This elegy recalls the funeral in early 2006 of famed makeup artist Lynne Easton , who worked with numerous Pop stars , including the Pet Shop Boys .
The lyrics move back and forth in time serving as an uplifting celebration of the glamour and vibrancy of the late seventies and early eighties .
The song was originally written by the Per Shop Boys back during their 2008 Yes sessions and was considered for inclusion on that album .
However producer Brian Higgins vetoed its selection .
Elysium opened with a track , `` Leaving , '' in which Neil Tennant reflects on the loss of his parents and this song completes the thematic cycle of the album , by ending it with another song inspired by death .
