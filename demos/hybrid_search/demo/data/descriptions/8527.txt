In the December 1993 issue of Select magazine , Johnny Marr said : `` Strangeways suffers because it was our last record , so people think there were arguments and horrors in making it , but there were n't .
Morrissey and I both think it 's possibly our best album .
That and some of The Queen Is Dead , which accepted opinion says is our masterpiece .
That might be true , but Strangeways has its moments , like ` Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Love Me . '
Last time I met Morrissey he said it was his favorite Smiths song . ''
The cover of the single features Billy Fury .
David Bowie said that this is his favorite Smiths song .
He told Q in 1992 : `` I still rate Morrissey as one of the best lyricists in Britain . ''
In 2003 , Outkast 's Andre 3000 told MTV that he wished he wrote this song : `` I personally wish I would have written that Smiths song ` Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me . '
Genius song .
This girl named Hannah in Atlanta turned me on to them .
'Cause I was telling her that I loved The Hives and The Buzzcocks and she said , ` Hey , you need to check these guys out . ' ''
The song was edited for the single release , losing the piano introduction found on the album version .
The album version starts with 2 minutes of noise from the 1984-85 miners ' strike -LRB- supplied by a BBC sound effects album -RRB- accompanied by some maudlin piano chords .
The miners strike was a major industrial action affecting the British coal industry .
The defeat of the miners significantly weakened the British trades union movement .
The album takes its title from a combination of Manchester 's now renamed Strangeways Prison , and the line `` Borstal , here we come '' from the movie Billy Liar .
