This is the second single from American pop singer Kaci Battaglia 's sophomore studio album Bring It On .
The song features Atlanta rapper Ludacris and was released via iTunes and Amazon.com on July 13 , 2010 .
The song reached # 1 on Billboard 's Hot Dance Club Songs , Battaglia 's second successive single following Crazy Possessive to achieve the top spot on that chart .
Battaglia wrote the song with longtime collaborators Michael Grant , Arianna Wilson , Jarreau Pitts and Trevor Pitts .
The song 's lyrics are based on a conversation that Battaglia had with some of her girlfriends before her 21st birthday .
She explained on her Facebook page : `` I had been talking to some of my friends about what we were going to do when I turned 21 , and they were pushing for me to try a body shot .
Later that day , when we were in the studio , I decided to see if I could capture what that experience might be like in a song .
It was really fun to write and it already goes down a storm when I perform it live !
`` What 's a `` body shot '' ?
It depends who you ask , but you need two people to do it , and it usually involves tequila .
One person puts some salt on their neck and a lime wedge in their mouth , then another person licks the salt , drinks a shot of tequila , and bites the lime .
The video features Kaci and some girls dancing in the studio and Ludacris make a guest appearance too .
Battaglia said regarding the clip : `` Ludacris and I had an incredible time shooting the clip with European director , Stephanie Pistel - working in studios in both New York and Miami .
We took a very symbolic approach to the video and hope that we came up with something classy , fresh and fun . ''
