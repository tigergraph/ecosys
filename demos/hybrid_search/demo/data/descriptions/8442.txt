This is the first single from rapper and actor Ice Cubes 's ninth studio album , I Am the West .
The song features on the hook Suave House Records recording artist/producer Jigg , who also produced the track .
Jigg 's other credits include producing for Rick Ross and Young Buck .
Ice Cube explained in an interview : `` My inspiration behind the album was , I felt like West Coast artists have been searching for what we need to do to get the attention of the industry .
Ultimately what I said is we need to do what we do best .
To do the music that we made famous , which is hardcore gangster rap and in my case , be proud of the West and our contributions to what we did and what we 're doing for Hip Hop . ''
The song 's Wild West styled music video was helmed by director Gabriel Hart -LRB- Young Jeezy , Plies , B.o.B -RRB- , who told MTV News that he originally was n't sure what treatment to deliver to Cube .
`` I started thinking about all the cliché sh -- that goes along with L.A. videos , '' Hart said .
`` Stuff that had been killed before .
Cube gets on the phone and I give him ideas , but I was n't confident or standing behind what I was saying .
He told me it was cliché .
And he was right .
He 's done everything already , so what can he do that 's never been done ?
If you see my videos , I always want to do something different .
But how do you tell Cube , ' I do n't wan na do that sh -- no more , I do n't want to do any f -- ing dominoes ' ?
So , respectfully , I was like , ` Let 's do this and that . '
And he said , ` No . '
So , in my mind , I was actually like , ` Thank you . '
Then he said , ` We 're going to the Old West , ' and hung up the phone .
That was the conversation . ''
