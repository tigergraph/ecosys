Winwood played many of the instruments on Back In The High Life and wrote the music for the songs , but for this and many other songs on the album , Will Jennings wrote the lyrics .
Jennings is a very successful songwriter who also collaborated with Winwood on the albums Arc Of A Diver and Talking Back To The Night , and went on to write `` My Heart Will Go On '' with James Horner for the movie Titanic .
Jennings told us : `` I was born in East Texas and my mother and father 's families were from Arkansas and the generations before were from the Deep South .
My father 's father was a Methodist preacher , a circuit rider , in Arkansas .
My earliest memories are of the music in church and of my aunts and uncles singing the beautiful old hymns .
` Higher Love ' is a generation past that , when things were not so much taken for granted , so that one has to plea , ` Bring me a higher love , ' and the lines are all trying to explain why there must be higher love .
A modern hymn , you might call it . ''
