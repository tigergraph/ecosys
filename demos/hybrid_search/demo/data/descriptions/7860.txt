This is a track from Hurley , the eighth studio album by American alternative rock band Weezer .
Frontman Rivers Cuomo penned the song with Minnesota-based singer-songwriter Dan Wilson .
Dan Wilson explained in an interview with American Songwriter how he collaborated with Cuomo on this song : `` We wrote some lyrics for the verse , and he generated most of those , and I helped .
And then I wrote the lyrics to the chorus , except for the last line , which is the title , which is his , and amazing .
We kind of wrote the verse together , and then I said to him that I thought it sounded too innocent , and he said , ` We 'll revise the innocence out later . '
And then a week later he e-mailed me new lyrics and it was exactly that ; the same story , the same song , but everything innocent and sweet was removed and replaced by something really funny and zippy and great , and sort of spicy .
That was real collaborative , on the lyrics , and we wrote the music together . ''
Dan Wilson is the lead singer of Semisonic , for whom he wrote the hits `` Secret Smile '' , `` Closing Time '' , and `` Chemistry . ''
He also co-wrote with the Dixie Chicks ' some of their 2006 album Taking the Long Way , which won the Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards .
One of the tracks he contributed to was `` Not ready To Make Nice '' , for which Wilson won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year along with the Dixie Chicks .
