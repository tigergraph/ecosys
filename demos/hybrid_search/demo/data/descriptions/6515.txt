When Hendrix was living in Seattle , it was a very segregated city .
The Spanish Castle was , in the '60s , the Premier teen night club in the Seattle area , but Jimi 's bands never played there .
Eventually , Hendrix left Seattle and made history .
-LRB- thanks , Mark - Seattle , WA -RRB- Hendrix used his octavia device on his guitar , which could alter the pitch .
He also used the octavia on `` Purple Haze . ''
and piano on this song .
Noel Redding played a 8-string Hagstrom bass on this .
At that time , there were only 2 of these instruments in the country : Redding 's one and a left-hand model for Hendrix .
Hendrix played the piano on this .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France , for above 3 -RRB-
