This song was written about Pearl Jam 's bus driver while they were on tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
They toyed with the idea that he was a serial killer .
This sounds very much like the kind of music the Chili Peppers make .
Pearl Jam also slightly altered a lyric from the song `` Freaky Styley '' by the Chilis : `` F-ck 'em just to see the look on their face '' was changed to `` Cook 'em just to see the look on their face . ''
