The second single from British Indie band Everything Everything ' s second album , Arc , is an electronic R&B groover .
Its title is a term of endearment used towards The Lone Ranger by his Native American sidekick , Tonto .
Frontman Jonathan Higgs revealed to Q magazine the song ' s lyrics equate The Lone Ranger and Tonto ' s relationship to that of domestic abuse .
Higgs explained the song 's meaning to The Line Of Best Fit : `` It 's about turbulent relationships and feeling alone even if you are with somebody .
It 's playing off the Lone Ranger and his relationship with Tonto .
The fact that he 's the Lone Ranger despite - well , he 's always been Tonto .
I always thought that was funny and a bit weird .
And I liked the language : ` Yippeekayay ' and ` Hiyo Silver ' and ` Kemosabe ' . ''
The phrase ` Kemo Sabe , ' meaning ` faithful friend ' was presented during the original The Lone Ranger radio series as being from a genuine North American language .
However , according to Brewer ' s Dictionary of Modern Phrase and Fable , it was the creation of the Lone Ranger ' s inventor , WXYZ radio station owner George W. Trendle .
The term ' s use subsequently became so widespread it was entered into Webster ' s New Millennium Dictionary in 2002 .
