-LRB- thanks , Mike - Mountlake Terrace , WA , for all above -RRB- The song title is a question famously put without a question mark , indicating it is more rhetorical .
Warwick : `` I thought it was a really silly song .
Obviously Hal David had a great affinity for San Jose as I believe he was stationed there during his time time in the Navy and he loved the place and he wrote a song about it .
I just giggled all the way to the bank , what can I tell you ? ''
Burt Bacharach -LRB- from Record Collector magazine -RRB- : `` Dionne did not want to record that song .
She did n't like it .
But we talked her into it and she did it .
Her mind changed once it was a hit -LRB- laughs -RRB- .
I knew it was a pretty special song and I knew it was a different kind of song , too . ''
