This is a track from Story Of Your Life , the fourth full-length studio album by CCM artist Matthew West .
The singer/songwriter turned to his fans via web and radio for songwriting material for the record , asking them to submit their stories of restoration , celebration , pain , hope and more .
He received around ten thousand replies from across the world .
While many of the tales were dark , others were very uplifting .
This song , for instance , relates the hope for children who are adopted and the idea that as each is adopted , there is one less child waiting for his or her loving home .
`` I thought at first the record was going to be very down , '' West admitted to The Boot .
`` But in the end , it is perhaps the most hopeful record I 've ever made .
It has given me the chance to be the messenger and storyteller and relate other people 's stories to the world . ''
