Detroit Social Club are an Indie Rock band from Newcastle-upon-Tyne , England formed in 2007 .
This was their second single released on 30 March 2009 .
Main man David Burn told Q magazine March 2010 that he preferred not to be referred to as a songwriter .
He explained : `` I consider myself a vibe creator , the words and what other people relate to , like the songs , that 's just the sprinkles on top of the music I 've spent ages doing . ''
He added : `` We 've got this song ` Sunshine People ' and I wanted the snare sound so that when someone hears it they 'll want to go out and get pissed , smoke loads of tabs and pull five birds . ''
