Funeral For a Friend vocalist Matt Davies-Kreye told Kerrang !
September 13 , 2008 about this song : He said : `` The media has made an aggressive standpoint on targeting current Rock acts as the reasons behind the current fears that the youth of today are becoming more involved in self-harming and suicide .
We all know these claims are just a way of passing the buck to divert us away from the real issues .
This took some shaping from the early demo to get it just right and all it came down to was some simple arranging to let the song move better . ''
