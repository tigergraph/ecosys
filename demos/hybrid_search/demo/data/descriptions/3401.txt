Moore wrote this song with his frequent collaborators Brian Dean Maher and Jeremy Stover .
He recalled to Great American Country just before the album 's release : `` We wrote that probably five or six years ago .
I steered away from writing any love songs up to that point .
I said , ` Man , we 've got to write a love song .
You ca n't make a record in Nashville without a love song . '
But I was like , ` We ca n't write a sappy , I love you and all this stuff .
It has to still be me . '
That 's one of the most Southern rock-sounding songs on the record it . ''
Moore explained this song 's lyrical content to Great American Country : `` It 's about making love .
Some of the lines are , ` Worked hard all week and now you 're here with me / Staring up at a summer sky . '
I 've been married for two years and I 'm gone so much , so I can relate to this song now more than I could then .
I 'm gone so much and you just do n't have time to do some of the things that you used to do together , so it 's about taking advantage of the time you do have together and making the most of it . ''
