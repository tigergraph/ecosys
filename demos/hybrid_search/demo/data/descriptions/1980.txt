This is an attack on Fox News , a network Nas denounces as visual cancer .
The song was written as a consequence of Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly 's denouncing Nas ' participation in a memorial concert at Virginia Tech as an `` insult to the victims '' of the shootings in 2007 .
On July 23 , 2008 , Nas teamed up with the activist group Color of Change to protest Fox News , accusing the network of racism .
Nas read a statement in front of their headquarters in New York City , and claimed to have over 600,000 signatures on a petition to back up his position .
Fox News made this statement in response : `` Fox News believes in all protesters exercising their right to free speech , including Nas , who has an album to promote . ''
The lyrics , `` Only Fox that I love was the red one '' is a reference to the popular black comedian Redd Foxx , who starred in the TV show Sanford and Son .
Spin magazine asked Nas about the line in the song concerning how Fox News makes him want to donate to PBS .
The rapper replied : `` I love PBS !
I grew up on it .
If I had to say which channels were good , I 'd say , you got your PBS , your History Channel , your Discovery . ''
Nas performed this on the Colbert Report on July 24 , where he was interviewed among the boxes of petitions he brought to the Fox News protest .
