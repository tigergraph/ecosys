Agnes co-wrote three tracks on Dance Love Pop , including this song .
She explained to Do n't StopThe Pop : `` I had an idea and me and my producer worked on the song and developed it .
Agnes added : `` My first thought about the song - I had a picture in my head - you are on a dance floor - the only thing you have in mind is yourself and the music - you do n't think about today or tomorrow ... It 's a nice mix in the song .
At the same time it 's an up tempo dance song - but the lyrics have a meaning and a deeper thought . ''
