George Michael wrote this song about his lover , Anselmo Feleppa , who died of an AIDS-related illness in 1993 .
The beginning of the song describes Anselmo 's mother , who visits his grave , while passing by the school he attended .
The first chorus has Anselmo 's mother saying goodbye , telling him `` You have been loved . ''
The ending chorus has Anselmo dying , telling George , `` You have been loved . ''
The line , `` If I was weak , forgive me ; but I was terrified , '' refers to the trauma George felt during Anselmo 's decline in health.While an intense song about grief and death , it also involves a spiritual struggle - while Anselmo and his mother both say that God is not dead , George counters their comments , challenging God , `` What 's the use in pressing palms , if you -LSB- God -RSB- wo n't keep such love from harm ?
It 's a cruel world .
You 've so much to prove . ''
