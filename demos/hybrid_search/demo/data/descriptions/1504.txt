Paul Weller `` It 's the song I play to the kids to make them fall asleep !
-LRB- laughs -RRB- .
I dip in and out of all sorts of music .
I do n't see genr√©s - you just listen to different things at different times .
This was inspired by my interest in -LRB- French Composers -RRB- Eric Satie , Debussy and an English composer called William Walton . ''
`` Fur Kinder '' is German for `` For Children . ''
