In an interview with the UK music weekly , the NME , vocalist Julian Casablancas said he thinks this progressive track has `` a kind of early R.E.M. vibe '' and the abrupt ending is a witty echo of `` Hard To Explain . ''
He added : `` It 's a darker one .
It counters some of the happy vibes on the other tracks .
I like dark things ! ''
