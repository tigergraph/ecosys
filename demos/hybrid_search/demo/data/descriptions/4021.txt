This piano-driven number was written , produced and arranged by New York-bred R&B singer-songwriter Alicia Keys .
It 's the twelfth track on her third studio album , As I Am .
Keys performed this as the opening number on the charity telethon , Hope for Haiti Now : A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief that was held on January 22 , 2010 .
Keys wrote this ballad as a result of meeting children surviving in difficult circumstances whilst traveling in Africa .
The song is a cry for help from someone who is feeling `` heavy-hearted '' asking for `` an angel , to guide me . ''
This is an entirely difficult song to the 1938 Duke Ellington tune of the same title .
