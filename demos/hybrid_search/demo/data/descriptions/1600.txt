Morgan penned this tribute to family meals with longstanding creative partner Phil O'Donnell and Shane Minor .
He explained to Yahoo !
Music : `` Just a song that talks about a political perspective , in a non-political way .
You know , there 's a lot going on in the world , and it 's one of those songs that talks about the reason we 're having so many problems is because we do n't gather as a family anymore.In my house , the kitchen was the place where everybody gathered - still does to this day .
As a kid , I remember growing up , I used to sit on the bottom stair , it came right outside the kitchen , and my mom would cut my hair there .
There 's something special about walking through the house , or into the house and through the kitchen ... the smell of supper cooking on the stove .
These are things that verbally we created such images that you do n't even have to close your eyes to see it .
It 's just a wonderful song talking about how the world is a better place when you have a good kitchen . ''
