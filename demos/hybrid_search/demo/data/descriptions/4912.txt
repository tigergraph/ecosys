This ballad entwines Gary Lightbody 's vocals with backing from US folk singer Lissie .
`` She sings from a place of inspiration , '' Lightbody told Q magazine , `` all we said was Give it some Gim me Shelter !
And boy , did she . ''
The song recalls Lightbody 's childhood in Bangor , Northern Ireland .
He explained its meaning to The Sun : `` It 's about my first love and the innocence of youth , playing in the garden .
It 's a song about my personal experience of that , but also a universal thing about the girl you fall in love with first .
You 're never able to really tell her , then she goes off and has her life and she 'll never know how you feel about her . ''
