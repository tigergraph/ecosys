This track from English singer-songwriter Kate Bush 's sixth studio album , The Sensual World features backing vocals by the Bulgarian vocal ensemble the Trio Bulgarka supported by some Irish piping by folk musician Davey Spillane .
Bush re-visited the song for her 2011 album , Director 's Cut , in which she updated a selection of tracks from The Sensual World and The Red Shoes .
Bush explained the song 's meaning to the NME : `` It 's that whole thing of how , in some situations , it 's the dream you want , not the real thing .
It was pursuing a conscious realization that a person is really enjoying the fantasy and aware it wo n't become reality .
So often you think it 's the end you want , but this is actually looking at the process that will never get you there .
Bit of a heart-game you play with yourself . ''
