Mellencamp debuted this song on May 17 , 2009 at a political fundraiser for President Barack Obama at the Westin Hotel in downtown Indianapolis .
He went on to perform it solo on acoustic guitar throughout much of his 2009 summer tour with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson .
The Dali Lama used this track as the impromptu inspiration for a sermon after Mellencamp performed it during a luncheon at the Tibetan Cultural Center in Bloomington , Indiana .
`` I did n't even know what he was saying because I was behind the PA system , '' Mellencamp told Billboard magazine with a laugh .
`` I was very flattered that the holiest man maybe on Earth had critiqued one of my songs . ''
Mellecamp explained the song : `` It 's about individual freedom and thought - and controlling our own lives . ''
