Portland folk singer and songwriter Laura Gibson 's fifth album is titled after La Grande , a small town situated in the forests of the Pacific Northwest where she parked her trailer and wrote and recorded the ten tracks that make up the record .
The dark sonics of the cinematic title track give it a gothic feel .
Gibson explained the background to the song to Spinner : `` I took a trip out to La Grande as I was writing songs for this new record , and perhaps thinking of the ways I myself fight to assert my being into the world .
I was thinking about movement forward , and looking towards a day that my time will come to pass , trying not to fear it .
It was one of those startling moments you find your own desires and fears reflected in the landscape .
The song ` La Grande ' was my best attempt at capturing that reflection . ''
