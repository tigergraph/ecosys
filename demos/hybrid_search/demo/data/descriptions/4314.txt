This is the second single from American Christian rock band Needtobreathe 's third studio album , The Outsiders .
The song is about inspiration and hope in difficult times .
Guitarist Bo Rinehart explained : `` When I wrote ` Something Beautiful , ' I was in a pretty desperate state .
I kinda felt like I had n't seen anything truly inspiring in awhile .
And we 're taught that inspiration is just around the corner , but the problem is , it may not be until the fifteenth corner that we finally see it .
We talk about that risk and we use a metaphor in the verse of being ` ankle deep in the ocean ' but ` the water is rising quick ' and the tide 's coming in , y' know , am I gon na drown , in search of this thing that I 've been looking for .
But I believe that anything worth having , is worth the risk of losing it .
The Scripture that comes to mind is that ' a broken heart and a contrite spirit He has yet to deny . '
In the song , we do n't really give the answer of how to find something beautiful .
Because how you find that may be completely different than me .
But I 'm pretty sure it 's going to start with a broken heart and a contrite spirit . ''
