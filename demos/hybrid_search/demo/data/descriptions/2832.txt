When you 're all alone , by yourself , you can feel horrible .
Avril knows this feeling and in the song , she tells you how she felt when she went through it .
You feel like you 're so lonely and scared , trying to find yourself and figure everything out , but you just ca n't .
You wish someone would help you , but no one does , until one person picks you up and helps you from up from the floor .
