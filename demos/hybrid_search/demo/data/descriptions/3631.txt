In June 2005 , Jack 's Mannequin frontman Andrew McMahon was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia .
A documentary was filmed about his grueling treatment and full recovery , which came out on DVD in 2009 .
Along with it was released an accompanying EP , Dear Jack , with a portion of the proceeds going to McMahon 's cancer research foundation .
McMahon explained to Spin magazine that this song , `` was half written during Everything In Transit , and the other half after I found out my sister would be my stem-cell donor .
It 's a song about and for my sister . ''
