-LRB- thanks , Andy - Cleveland , OH -RRB- When Roger Waters heard Dave Gilmour playing this song , he thought is sounded like the theme to an old Western The Magnificent Seven .

They did n't have a title for the album , but needed one when BBC Radio 1 aired some of it .
The album 's producer Ron Geesin had Roger Waters look through the newspaper The Evening Standard to find a title , and he came across the story about a pregnant woman who received an experimental pacemaker .
The cow on the cover had nothing to do with the story - Pink Floyd chose the cow because it was the least psychedelic thing they could think of .
