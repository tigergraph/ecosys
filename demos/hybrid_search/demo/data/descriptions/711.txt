The Rej3ctz are a rap-trio from Los Angeles comprising Pee W33 , Mowii and Bounc3 .
Madonna fans may have come across Mowii before , as he has toured the world as a backup dancer for the Queen of Pop .
The Rej3ctz have long been considered pioneers of the Jerk movement and this JHawk-produced tune from their 2010 mixtape The FUNKtion shares its title with the Cat Daddy dance craze .
The # 1 supporter of this dance movement is Chris Brown , and the three Rej3ctz members enlisted the R&B singer for their Alex Nazari directed video , which was shot on California 's Venice Beach boardwalk .
Bounc3 shared with MTV News how the dance and song came about : `` Our bro Rej3ct Sam he called us up Iike ` Man , I got this dance called the ` Cat Daddy , ' '' he said .
`` We ran with it , straight to -LSB- our producer -RSB- JHawk like ` We need a beat ASAP . '
We sittin ' there doing the Cat Daddy and he 's making the beat around our dance .
It happened so naturally we just knew it was gon na be a hit . ''
