This is the theme song for the 2009 James Cameron directed movie , Avatar .
Lewis told the Canadian newspaper Sun Media that she is thrilled to have a song on the soundtrack .
`` I saw a half-hour clip of the film .
It 's not finished yet , and it 's insane , it 's awesome , it 's amazing .
I ca n't even explain it , '' she said .
`` I heard the song - great lyrics , very , very epic .
So I went in and I did it .
And then they played it to James and he phoned me up and he was like , ` Oh , my God .
I love you ! '
He 's so cool .
My God , I had this perception that he was going to be , like , totally untouchable and unreachable .
But he 's just like your nice uncle .
He 's lovely . ''
This was written by James Horner and Simon Franglen .
Horner is a composer who scored the music for Avatar as well as James Cameron 's earlier films Aliens and Titanic ; Franglen is a producer who has worked on the soundtracks for many films , including Titanic .
