This Electro-pop ballad about dreaming of escape is the title track of Dido 's fourth album , her first record since 2008 's Safe Trip Home .
The singer admitted to The Guardian that she takes her time to release her records , but this set was `` nearly finished in 2010 and was ready to surprise everyone ... then I got pregnant and had a baby boy , Stanley ! ''
Dido told The Guardian that she decided to title the album after this song `` because I do keep disappearing for a while between albums . ''
She added : `` I love the song of that name too ... it was the one that Stanley would kick to the most while I was singing it . ''
