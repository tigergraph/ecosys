Robert Smith : `` The song is about excess .
Anything I do is not enough , there always has to be something else or you 'd stop , and the fact that there is always something else drives you into excess . ''
Although Perry Bamonte is on the cover and music video , he is not included on the credits for this single .
He only joined The Cure later in the year .
Smith wrote this after they had been in the studio 3 days trying to record a single for Mixed Up .
He says , `` We recorded 4 songs and they sounded like crap , and I was really depressed .
Everyone knew it was n't working .
I wrote Never Enough that night and said , ` Let 's record this . ' ''

According to Smith , this song inspired The Cure to `` become a guitar band again '' following the gloomy sound of their 1989 album Disintergration .
