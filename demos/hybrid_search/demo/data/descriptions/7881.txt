Mann co-wrote this song with her long-term collaborator and bassist Paul Bryan for a musical .
The tune features a guest appearance by The Shins frontman James Mercer , who duets with Mann .
She told Mojo magazine the song came about after West Wing/The Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin asked her to write the music for an idea he 'd had .
`` So just for fun Paul Bryan and I wrote this character confrontation between this man and this ... crazy girl , '' she explained .
`` I got in contact with James - who 's amazing and awesome - and we were surprised for him to sing on it .
It 's not the normal duet subject matter of ' I love you !
You 're wonderful ! '
It 's two people literally ripping each other to shreds .
It really makes me laugh . ''
