This is a track from The Civil Wars ' eponymous second album .
`` This song always conjures up an image of a glass of whiskey and a lit cigarette , '' said Joy Williams of the Indie-Folk duo .
`` It 's a little brooding .
A little dangerous .
It smolders .
It has swagger and grit .
It 's full of innuendo and Southern Gothic tones .
I love the feel of this track , and the way this song came together on the record . '
I Had Me a Girl ' is one of those musical moments that makes me wish I knew how to play electric guitar .
Or any guitar , for that matter . ''
Working with the Southern production company 1504 Pictures , Williams and her Civil War partner John Paul White released a behind-the-scenes video for the album .
`` There were moments when John Paul would pick up a guitar and he and Joy would transport to a different place , '' director Mark Slagle of 1504 Pictures said .
`` You can see it when John Paul plays ' I Had Me A Girl ' in the control room and Joy starts moving with the melody .
There was definitely a creative push and pull , but watching them grow a song from nothing , giving and taking , was incredibly inspiring . ''
