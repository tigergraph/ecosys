The conflict in Northern Ireland , which also spilled over into England and the Republic of Ireland dates from the late 1960s .
After decades of violence the Belfast `` Good Friday '' Agreement of 1998 bought an end to most of the atrocities that were perpetrated by the various parties .
This song finds Flogging Molly 's Dave King singing about the self-destructiveness of the Irish .
He explained to Alternative Press magazine : `` In Ireland , we were always the underdog .
We were always being pinned down .
And in latter years , we were pinning ourselves down , fighting among ourselves .
And it was pathetic , so f -- ing ridiculous .
And now we 're really working on a lasting peace in Ireland .
And now that you can look back on that in a country where I thought you never could have , it 's such a positive thing , and it makes it easier to go back and sing songs like that.I think you have to be in a good state of mind to be able to go back and revisit -LSB- the bad -RSB- times .
And when you do , you come up with songs like ` The Cradle Of Humankind ' and ` Present State Of Grace ' and ` The Worst Day Since Yesterday ' and turn the bad times into a positive thing .
And I 've been very fortunate to be able to do that . ''
