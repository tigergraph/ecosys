This hip-hop anthem features guest vocals from Busta Rhymes .
Frontman Travis McCoy told Rolling Stone magazine : `` The hip-hop enthusiasts did n't really take me serious as an MC , and I 'm making for damn sure they do on this record . ''
This was recorded in Miami with Lil Wayne producers Cool and Dre .
McCoy told Rolling Stone that it was Dre who hooked up Busta Rhymes for his guest vocal .
He added that after Dre played a demo for the rapper on speakerphone , Rhymes exclaimed : `` Yo !
I 'm coming to Miami right now !
If you do n't save me a verse on this song , I 'm going to kill all of ya 'll . ''
