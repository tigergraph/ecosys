Co-vocalist Ana Matronic told The Sun : '' -LRB- Bassist and lyricist -RRB- Babydaddy had to convince me about that song .
I 'm a crazy cat lady .
I 'll be one of those old ladies with a billion cats and a house that smells of pee .
So I texted him that I did n't want to skin , or advocate skinning any cats .
But when I went into the studio , I just loved the track . ''
