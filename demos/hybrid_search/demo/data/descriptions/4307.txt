This upbeat pop/rock number is the second single from American band Hanson 's eighth studio album , Shout It Out .
The song acts as the follow-up to Thinking ` Bout Somethin' . ''
` Give a Little ' is the perfect connector to the first single , '' Taylor Hanson told MTV News .
`` There 's this energy to it .
Strangely , there 's this dance theme .
We 're not known for our dancing , but dancing is this metaphor that 's in the record . '' ''
-LSB- The metaphor -RSB- is kind of ` Get out there and let loose , ' '' Taylor added .
`` Spring will be here before we know it , and the song is upbeat and hopefully engaging . ''
The music video was shot on the same weekend as `` Thinking ` Bout Somethin' '' and features the dancers from that clip plus family and friends dancing .
`` When we made the video , it was kind of the release after the high production of ` Thinking ` Bout Somethin' , '' Taylor explained to MTV News .
`` With the ` Give a Little ' video , it 's almost back to the blank slate .
We invited all these dancers .
We just set up a room , cranked up the music and threw a party and let people dance .
The attitude is not about everyone doing the same moves ; it 's about putting a unique twist . ''
