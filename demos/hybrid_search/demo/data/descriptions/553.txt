This is the official theme song for the 2010 remake of The Karate Kid .
The song is performed by Justin and the 11-year-old son of actor Will Smith , Jaden Smith. , who stars in the role made famous by Ralph Macchio in the original classic 1984 movie .
Unlike Justin 's other songs , which tend to be about puppy love , this tune has an inspirational message : `` I never had the strength to take it higher , until I reached the point of no return .
Gon na give everything I have/It 's my destiny/I will never say never , '' he sings .
Justin recorded a short video for the unplugged version of the song , which was included on his acoustic album , My World 's Acoustic .
The clip features the teen star singing from a baseball diamond and he told MTV News that he wanted to make the video for the World Series as he 's a big sports fan .
`` For ` Never Say Never , ' it 's kind of like a really inspiring song , so I think that , you know , for people watching it , I guess it 's really inspiring .
I mean , I love sports , '' explained Justin .
Jaden 's lines reference his father when he puns , `` raised by the power of Will . ''
He also makes references to Luke Skywalker and Kobe Bryant .
This was originally conceived as a far more sultry song , titled `` Sexy Together . ''
It was originally demoed back in 2010 by former NLT boy band member Travis Garland in the beginning stages of his solo career with the strikingly different lyrics .
`` We 're so sexy together , when we touch hotter than summer weather .
No one else does it better , and know that everybody wants what we got , we 're sexy together . ''
Garland recalled to MTV News : `` The story behind that is that was a song I wrote with a production team called the Messengers it was called ` Sexy Together ' and I actually cut the song .
Eventually decided it was n't right for me and I was n't going to use it , so I said go ahead and shop it for somebody else , and so they ended up just rewriting my lyrics and then selling it to Justin Bieber for his movie . ''
Justin and Jaden , together with Adam Messinger , Nasri Atweh , Thaddis `` Kuk '' Harrell and Omarr Rambert penned the song .
Messinger , and Atweh frequently write together and their other credits also include `` Up '' and `` That Should Be Me '' on My World 2.0 .
They also co-wrote Chris Brown 's 2009 single , `` Crawl . ''
Harrell was the vocal producer on the Canadian pop singer 's debut release , `` One Time . ''
This was the fifth single released in tandem with a Karate Kid movie to reach the Hot 100 .
The previous four to do so were :1984 `` The Moment of Truth , '' Survivor , # 631986 `` Glory of Love , '' Peter Cetera , # 11986 `` Earth Angel , '' New Edition , # 211986 `` This Is the Time , '' Dennis DeYoung , # 93 .
After spending five weeks on the Hot 100 in June and July 2010 , the song was reworked to radio as an accompanying single for Justin 's 3D documentary concert film Never Say Never .
As a consequence , it returned to the chart in early 2011 .
The song was re-released as the lead single from Never Say Never -- The Remixes , which accompanied Justin 's concert film Never Say Never .
The album debuted at # 1 on the Billboard 200 issue dated March 5 , 2011 .
Justin also had albums placed at # 8 , 18 and 31 in that week 's chart , making him the first artist to place four albums in the Top 40 concurrently since Garth Brooks in 1993 .
