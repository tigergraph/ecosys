American Metalcore band Chimaira suffered more than their share of disturbance in the build up to the release of their sixth album The Age of Hell , losing both keyboardist Chris Spicuzza and drummer Andols Herrick in early 2011 .
Sean Zatorsky and Austin D'Amond replaced the departing duo , and frontman Mark Hunter explained the upheaval within the band was the inspiration behind the record 's lead single .
Said the singer : `` When life presents you with a fork in the road , sometimes the choices you are forced to make mentally drain you .
When those moments occur and you feel threatened , sometimes you have to bring a gun to a knife fight . ''
