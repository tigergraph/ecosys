The title track of The Stranglers ' seventeenth studio album speaks of the lack of `` giants '' in contemporary society .
Stranglers bassist JJ Burnel explained to Mojo magazine : `` The title track goes ` Once there were giants walking amongst us/Now I have to deal with little men with little hearts . '
Everything has got so petty and twee .
I went on a motorcycle ride to Flanders last year .
Fifty thousand young Frenchmen died in one day during the Battle of the Somme .
Could we do that again ? ''
