Phillips teamed up with `` Home '' songwriters Drew Pearson and Greg Holden to pen this tune .
He recalled to The Hollywood Reporter : `` We all got in a room , and I showed them an idea of the guitar part , started singing the verses and we just wrote the lyrics together .
It 's called ` Ca n't Go Wrong , ' and I really like that song .
It 's similar to ` Home . '
We all had a good time getting to know each other .
This is all new for all three of us .
... They understood where I was in my situation , and I understood where they were . ''
