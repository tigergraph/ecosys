Avril Lavigne wrote the lyrics to this song , which she worked on with professional songwriters Matthew Gerrard and B. Beneate .
It was intended for Lavigne 's second album , Under My Skin , but she did n't think it fit the album and let Clarkson record it as a single .
The song did so well that at the last minute , Clarkson 's second album was renamed Breakaway and this song was included on it .
-LRB- thanks , Donovan Berry - El Dorado , AR -RRB- This song was used in the movie The Princess Diaries 2 .
-LRB- thanks , Ferris - Ohio , OH -RRB- The song is about breaking away from an old life and trying new things .
Some may even consider it a song about growing up , and that could be true in some ways , but it is mostly about shedding your past and becoming a new person .
The theme appealed to Clarkson , who could relate to the lyrics .
Gerrard explained to Songwriter Universe Magazine : `` The song was originally written for Avril -LRB- Lavigne -RRB- , it was inspired by her .
As it turned out , it was n't quite right for Avril 's album , so we pitched it to Kelly Clarkson .
It all worked out great .
Kelly sounds great singing it , and it was a big hit for us . ''
