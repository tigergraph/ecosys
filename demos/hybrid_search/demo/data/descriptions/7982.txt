Wiz Khalifa 's first single from his sophomore album , O.N.I.F.C. , is a club track , in which the Pittsburgh spitter advises , `` Go hard .
Make sure you do whatever it is that you got ta do .
That 's your job , '' over a military march-inspired beat .
Wiz is well known for his trademark multiple tattoos , tank tops , camouflaged shorts and rolled marijuana joints .
He references the way others have adopted his garb , when he raps : `` If I 'm in the club , I get a 100 stacks , I 'm always rollin ' up , so I get love for that .
Them n -- as stole my swag , but I do n't want it back . ''
Wiz explained to MTV News correspondent Sway Calloway on Sway in the Morning that the album title is an acronym for `` Only N -- a in First Class , '' inspired by the name of Mobb Deep rapper Prodigy 's H.N.I.C. record .
The Norwegian production team Stargate and American hitmaker Benny Blanco produced the song .
Stargate oversaw the beats for three tracks on Wiz 's debut album , including his breakthrough hit , `` Black and Yellow , '' whilst Blanco collaborated with the Pittsburgh MC on his third single , `` No Sleep . ''
Blanco was red hot , also charting around this time with productions for Britney Spears , Gym Class Heroes , Katy Perry , and Flo Rida .
The Pittsburgh rapper flaunts his cash earned through hard work on the chorus .
`` The bigger the bill , the harder you ball , '' he rhymes .
`` Well , I 'm throwin ' mine , 'cause my money long .
The quicker you here , the faster you go .
That 's why where I come from the only thing we know is work hard , play hard . ''
The Bill Paladino-directed video was filmed in Khalifa 's hometown of Pittsburgh .
There are various images of factory folk , construction workers , a soccer player , and a ballerina , working hard so they can party later .
The Taylor Gang rapper appears later in the visual clad in hippie garb , channeling the late Jimi Hendrix .
