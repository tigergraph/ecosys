Dierks Bentley on Live Daily said : `` I love that song .
Gosh .
It 's one of my favorite songs on my record .
I kind of write from a first-person standpoint .
I was writing about more about my wife Cassidy .
I think that one of the -LSB- co-writers -RSB- was writing about his personal experience with his wife .
When you love somebody , you want to be next to them as soon as you can .
You kind of throw caution out the window and let your heart make decisions .
That 's kind of what that song 's about .
She took more chances than I did .
She was the one moving up to Nashville . ''
