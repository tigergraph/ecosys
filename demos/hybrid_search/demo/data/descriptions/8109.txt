This song was inspired by '80s filmmaker John Hughes ' soundtracks .
Frontman Simon Neil demoed the song entirely on keyboards .
He told NME : `` We wanted it to sound like your headphones were actually breaking and that you 'd have to take them off , check your speakers and make sure it had n't broken the machine . ''
