This is a track from English musician Peter Frampton 's 14th studio album , Thank You Mr. Churchill .
Frampton explained to Gibson.com how he came up with this song : `` I wrote that song during a break while on tour , year before last .
I was trying to come up with something new to do as an encore , really .
I wanted something that worked live , in a sort of Humble Pie-ish way .
And that 's what came out .
I had the riff , which was sort of an ad-lib piece I was doing on-stage , just before we played ` While My guitar Gently Weeps . '
When I got home , I started to see that riff as part of a much bigger piece . ''
