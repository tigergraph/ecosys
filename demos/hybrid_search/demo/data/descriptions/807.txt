This uplifting Pop number finds Rihanna telling a guy that she 's okay with him checking out other ladies .
The song is one of three on the Deluxe Edition of Talk That Talk to be co-produced by Terius `` The-Dream '' Nash , who is best known for co-writing her hit tune , `` Umbrella . ''
The-Dream told The Boombox that he `` was more called in to fill in the blanks , '' on the album .
He went on to explain that songwriter Ester Dean , who contributed to eight tracks on the record , `` is locked in to what Rihanna 's doing at this particular moment , '' and he 's `` at a place where you can call me in as a songwriter , but Ri calls me in as a friend that 's going to make an unbiased decision , not just because I 'm trying to get on the record . ''
