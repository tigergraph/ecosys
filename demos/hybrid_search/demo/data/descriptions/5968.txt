On an interview on XM Radio , lead singer Sully Erna talked about his fame and how he cheated on his girlfriend for many years while the band was touring .
She decided to stay with him , but it seemed like she would bring the cheating up whenever they had an argument .
The song is about him saying , `` I have screwed up and I have paid for it but you continue to bleed the life from me when you bring the subject up . ''
He gave her credit during the interview , saying that it was a huge pill for her to swallow and he appreciates her for that .
