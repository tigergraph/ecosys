This haunting song is one of Nashville singer-songwriter Gretchen Peters ' favorite tracks on her Hello Cruel World album .
She explained to Billboard magazine : `` I 've written a few songs over the past twenty years that are in some general sense about art .
That song falls under that category , but for me , it has to do with loving an artist , and making those sacrifices .
The woman in that song is coming to grips with loving someone with such a creative force , and what kind of sacrifices she has to make .
In a sense , the male and the female in that song are prototypes - male and female archetypes .
It was based on relationships that I 've seen .
I 've known my share of difficult men .
I have an ongoing fascination with Hemingway and Picasso , who were those sorts of artists . ''
