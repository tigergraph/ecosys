This was Iron Maiden 's first single .
The cover art featured a one-armed junkie skeleton watching lead singer Bruce Dickinson run .
This was an early version of Eddie , the band 's mascot .
The band was invited to perform this on BBC-TV 's Top of the Pops .
They said they 'd only appear if they could perform live .
The BBC agreed , and they became the first band to perform live on the show since The Who six years earlier .
There is a biography of Iron Maiden titled Running Free .
