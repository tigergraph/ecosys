This is one of Taylor 's vengeance songs in the tradition of `` Picture To Burn , '' but this time its aimed at a female .
It is rumored that the song is aimed at the young actress Joe Jonas pursued after dumping Swift .
The line , `` Come on , show me how much better you are , '' provides further evidence that Taylor is addressing Belle in this song .
The lyric is most likely a reference to the Jonas Brothers 2009 number `` Much Better . ''
That tune was felt by many to be an unkind remark at how superior Belle was in comparison to Swift .
-LRB- `` Now I 'm done with superstars/And all the teardrops on her guitar/I 'm not bitter/Now I see everything I need/Is the girl in front of me/She 's much better . '' -RRB-
The first line of this song goes : `` The story starts when it was hot and it was summer . ''
Taylor Swift and Joe Jonas dated in the summer of 2008 .
Then Joe met 10,000 BC actress Camilla Belle on the set of the Jonas Bros `` Lovebug '' video , where Taylor was nowhere to be found .
This song appears to be the Queen of Tween 's melodic stab at Belle for stealing her boyfriend - `` She came along , got him alone , and let 's hear the applause/She took him faster than you could say sabotage . ''
