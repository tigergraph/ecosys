This is the title track and lead single from Portugal The Man 's Evil Friends long player .
The record was produced by Brian Burton , aka Danger Mouse , who is known for his work with Gnarls Barkley as well as helming albums for the likes of Gorillaz , The Black Keys , and Norah Jones .
The music video was directed by the band 's pal Michael Ragen directed in their home state of Alaska .
Carothers told Artist Direct : `` We were watching some nineties or early ' 00s hip-hop video .
I think it was DMX or Ruff Ryders .
We liked that whole crew idea with everybody on motorcycles .
It 's that crew vibe .
We thought it 'd be rad to do something in Alaska .
That 's how it started .
We had him buy a shi -- y camcorder with night vision , bought some ski masks and clothes , and got a bunch of friends together .
It was really fun .
We filmed it about a half an hour from where I live at the end of this road .
There are some abandoned missile silos up there . ''
Portugal bassist Zachary Carothers told Artist Direct the song took a while to come together .
`` We initially wrote it , and it just was n't right , '' he explained .
`` We 'd gotten to a lull in the studio where we working on a bunch of other things .
It 's weird .
We just craft some songs on any given day .
It was missing a hook , lead line , or something .
We had gotten to a different studio in L.A. .
We had been at Brian 's studio pretty much the whole time for a couple of months .
`` Then , we went into a really old school super sixties-style studio , '' Carothers continued .
`` It 's a really amazing place with tons of vintage gear .
We all went into different rooms and said , ` If you were going to make the hook or important part on your instrument , go off and do it on your own . '
That guitar riff reminded me of something Nirvana would play .
It 's angsty , upbeat , and punk rock .
It was pretty fun . ''
