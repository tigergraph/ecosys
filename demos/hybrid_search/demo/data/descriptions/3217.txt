Jesca Hoop is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist from Northern California .
Bought up in a Mormon household , she grew up singing traditional folk tunes in four part harmony .
This instilled in her a love of traditional music , reflected in this murder ballad .
`` I grew up on one murder ballad , ` Greenwood Sidie-O , ' and I love them as a form , because people are singing about killing those they love the most , '' Hoop told The Independent April 23 , 2010 .
`` Music was my family 's primary connection , it was our strongest bond .
We were very much a Von Trapp family , my mom was a classical singer and my dad was a folk singer , so mom taught us to sing in harmonies at an early age . ''
Hoop was once a nanny for Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan 's three children .
Her contact with Waits led to her initial exposure at the Southern California radio station KCRW in 2003 .
Waits said with a rare quote -- `` Her music is like going swimming in a lake at night . ''
