Lead singer Sonny Sandoval : `` Originally , the lyrics were , ` Sounds like Jah to me , ' but then we realized we were talking about war .
Not necessarily the war that surrounds us in these times .
We 're talking more about that unseen wickedness or craziness in all of us , that war within that you fight through in your own personal life everyday .
And , how just knowing your strengths , you can make it through . ''
The working title for this song was `` Ya Mama . ''
