The Stones recorded this for Flashpoint in 1991 .
The album consists of live recordings from their Steel Wheels tour followed by 2 new studio tracks , this and `` Sex Drive . ''
The first line - `` We sell them missiles , we sell them tanks , we give them credit , you can call up the bank , '' was censored when The Stones performed it on the BBC TV show Top Of The Pops .
The song is a commentary on the international arms trade and the events that led to the first US war with Iraq , which ended around the time this was released .
Bernard Fowler sang background vocals .
Since the '90s , he has appeared on many Rolling Stones tracks .
He has also worked with Yoko Ono , Sly & Robbie , Bootsy Collins , Duran Duran , Living Colour and Herb Alpert .
