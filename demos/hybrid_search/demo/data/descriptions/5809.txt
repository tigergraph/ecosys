Rucker wrote this with the record producer and songwriter Frank Rogers -LRB- `` I 'm Gon na Miss Her -LRB- The Fishin ' Song -RRB- '' -RRB- .
He recalled on his record company 's website : `` We were talking about our lives and he had the idea of the grandpa at the top .
There was a man who lived two doors down from me , his son was my friend .
My father left when I was born and Mr. Campbell was there for me and taught me how to be a man .
I wanted to write a song that was a tribute to him .
He still lives two doors down from my sister in the house I grew up in .
He 's in his sixties now .
He was the guy who always told us to have fun and enjoy life , but be responsible .
The last verse is about my son . ''
