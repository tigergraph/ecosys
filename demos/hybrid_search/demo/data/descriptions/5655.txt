In this song , Holiday tells a girl that both his body and heart can belong to her .
Djbooth.net asked the R&B singer whether he 's ever approached a girl in a club and offered his heart and body , saying `` It 's Yours . ''
He replied : `` No , I have n't tried the approach , and I think that 's only because , for one , women do n't believe us .
So that 's number one , and , number two , I do n't think you really want to say that to somebody you just met in the club .
Maybe a female that you 've been dating for a while , and you guys are out together , that 's probably a little more comfortable for me .
But no , I have n't tried it .
I 'm sure it might work for somebody . ''
