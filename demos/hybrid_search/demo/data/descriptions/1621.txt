Lamb Of God open their seventh studio album , Resolution , with this track , which sets the mood for the record .
Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler told Lithium Magazine that the band , `` like the idea of some sort of mood setting introduction . ''
He explained : `` We hear it on a lot of records we like , where it 's some sort of piece of creative audio that is supposed to be scary or hype or something like that .
We 've always enjoyed the idea of creating that musically somehow .
Normally with us , there is this oddball song or tune where we do n't know really know what to do with it , and often times that winds up as the last song on the album , because we always try to end with a punctuation as well -- although I do n't know if people even listen to entire albums anymore .
But we also try to find something different but strong to put at the beginning of the album , something that is maybe not expected of us , and maybe break in a sound that is innovative or new for us as a band .
` Straight For The Sun ' is one of those things.We have n't really done anything like that song since the -LRB- 1999 -RRB- Burn The Priest record .
We did n't know what to make of it when we brought it into the practices .
It was fun to play , certainly .
It 's sludgy and it 's good , but it 's not the typical kind of speed metal that is showing off all the tricks we tend to put forward as a band .
It turned out to be this really cool kind of a slap in the face to start off the new record . ''
