Lead singer Christian Lindskog : `` This song was an attempt to tie together what I saw in South Africa , where young men and women are dying of AIDS and other diseases and what we have seen in Europe and America , where young men and women are also dying but from a different cause - depression and a loss of hope .
The fight for life is with different enemies .
This was based on two different people : Yamkela , a young boy we met in South Africa and a friend in the States .
One fighting a battle with AIDS and the other fighting depression .
In both continents people are dying unnecessarily young .
When we wrote this there was a real fight for both their lives .
But as I write this today both of them are doing much better and have been able to see that even in these desperate situations there is hope for life . ''
Guitarist Simon Grenehed : `` When we first started talking about making a new record again after About A Burning Fire , we had a few things in mind .
First of all , we again wanted to bring more character to each instrument without letting the songwriting suffer .
We 've never wanted to experiment with music just for the cause of being difficult .
It 's rather an ongoing idea of continuing to develop into something new musically .
This time around was no different .
The first couple of rehearsals was a way of feeling each other out again musically .
Trying to figure out where we all were going .
It took a while before we found something that we felt strongly about . ''
