Outlaws founding member Henry Paul says this song is not about marijuana , but about rock and roll illuminaries , and the title , he says , was taken from the 1966 `` Best Of '' collection by the Rolling Stones called High Tides and Green Grass .
Says Paul , `` From what I gather , there was an album out , the best of the Rolling Stones , called ` High Tides and Green Grass . '
That was the name of the Rolling Stones ' greatest hits - this is like 1966 - and I think it was a manifestation of that title turned in reverse , ` Green Grass and High Tides . '
I know that much .
And I know that it was a song written for rock and roll illuminaries , from Janis Joplin to Jimi Hendrix , and it had nothing to do with marijuana .
But it had to do with , I think , a specific person 's lyrical look at rock and roll legends .
` As kings and queens bow and play for you . '
It 's about Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin .
` Castles of stone , soul and glory . '
A lot of it is just sort of a collage of words that really do n't have all that much to do with anything , they just fit and sounded right .
But I have to say it 's one of my favorite lyrics .
My songwriting is more Steinbeck , really rooted in accuracy and reality ; this is definitely Alice In Wonderland .
It 's the whole ` White Rabbit . '
It 's sort of like one of those magic lyrical moments that will forever be mysteriously unclearly conceived . ''

Because the game only has four tracks -LRB- guitar , bass guitar , drums , and vocals -RRB- , the song 's three guitar parts are combined into one track .
