This is the title track of Canadian Christian rockers Thousand Foot Krutch sixth studio album .
Frontman/songwriter Trevor McNevan told NewReleaseTuesday : `` The title speaks to me in a different way when I think about my faith , and how the Bible says we need to die to self , to really live .
It 's all about forgiveness .
We 've been through a lot of transition this past year as a band .
Thank God for His strength .
He keeps giving us a second wind when we need it . ''
This track was written before the song title became the album title .
McNevan explained the tune 's lyrical content to NewReleaseTuesday : `` Lyrically , in the verses , I set it up so each phrase was a play on words , like ` I 'm a loser , if that means I 've been lost before , ' ` I 'm a monster , if that means I 'm misunderstood , ' etc. .
I remember being so enamored by the old original Universal monsters characters , like Frankenstein for instance , and the fact that he only appeared to be a monster , but was actually there to help . ''
