This sad-yet-uplifting choir-assisted ballad was recorded around Christmas of 2011 - one of the first songs Hurts laid down for Exile .
The English duo enlisted a choir made up of fans from around the world for the expansive tune .
`` They were all brilliant , '' singer Theo Hutchcraft told NME .
`` It was such a powerful thing , watching them .
So emotional .
To hear a mass of people singing , ' I just need some help . '
It was heartbreaking . ''
Elton John played the piano on this track .
Hutchcraft could n't believe the iconic musician agreed to help out on the song .
`` It was one of the greatest days of my life - for real .
Watching Elton John play the piano on a song we wrote ?
I was speechless for weeks afterwards .
Speechless , '' The Sun quotes the Hurts vocalist as saying .
`` To beat that we 'll have to get a hologram of Elvis on the next one . ''
