Frontman and lyricist Johnny Borrell told The Sun October 31 , 2008 that this song 's lyrics are an attempt to deconstruct his boisterous public persona .
He explained : `` I was trying to write a song for where I 'm from , brash , uppity , arrogant North London .
That 's my heritage and I was n't gon na write a song pretending I 'm from somewhere else .
It is meant as kind of an ode to a fictional version of me , that enters people 's imaginations . ''
