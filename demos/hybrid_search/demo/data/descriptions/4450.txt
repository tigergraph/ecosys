Along with `` Do n't Pass Me By , '' this was one of 2 songs Ringo Starr wrote for The Beatles .
It came about when Ringo was on a boating trip with his family in Sardina in 1968 .
The boat 's captain offered him an octopus lunch , but he turned it down .
It was then that the captain began to tell him everything he knew about octopuses , and how they travel along the sea bed looking for shiny objects and stones with which to build gardens .
With this information , Ringo came up with the idea for this song .
George Harrison helped Ringo write this during the Let It Be sessions .
They are seen working on it in the movie Let It Be - George rewrote the chord sequence .
Ringo sang lead , as he did on many of the lighter Beatles songs , including `` Yellow Submarine '' and `` Act Naturally . ''
This was one of The Beatles songs that kids loved .
`` Yellow Submarine '' and `` Rocky Raccoon '' were others .
