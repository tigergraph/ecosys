Charles Wesley wrote this hymn to celebrate the first anniversary of his conversion on Whit Sunday 1738 .
It was inspired by a Moravian friend Peter Bohler , who had remarked to him , `` If I had a thousand tongues I would praise Christ with them all . ''
The words set the poet 's heart aglow and to celebrate the anniversary he wrote the hymn .
