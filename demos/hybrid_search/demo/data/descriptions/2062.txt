Our Lady Peace loves playing this song live .
In 2012 , their guitarist Steve Mazur told us that of all of the songs he 'd written with the band over the course of a decade , this song is the one he was the most proud of .
Explaining why , Mazur says , `` It was a real band effort .
I thought it had a great mood and all four of us on that one were swinging and coming up with stuff .
That 's one we play live and we still very much feel and love . ''
