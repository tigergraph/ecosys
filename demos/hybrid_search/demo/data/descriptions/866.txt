In the Garth Brooks 6 CD set , Brooks said of this song : `` I was on the road when I got a call from a buddy of mine , telling me my horse , Cracker Jack , had died .
This was the first horse all 3 of my girls rode and the last horse my mother had ridden ... a true friend .
I tried like hell to find a way to get back home to bury him that evening , but I could n't get there until the next morning .
As I pulled up in the pasture where Cracker Jack laid , I realized my buddy had built a campfire and had slept next to Cracker Jack all night with a 30/30 to keep the coyotes off him .
Where I 'm from , when someone does something extraordinary for someone else , we call him a cowboy .
Well in this case , my buddy was a cowgirl friend of mine named Tami .
I guess it just goes to show you ... ` sometimes the best cowboys ai n't cowboys at all . ' ''
