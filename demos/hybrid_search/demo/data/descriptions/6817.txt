This song details the life of Irish born Lola Montez , -LRB- 1821 -- 1861 -RRB- who became famous as an erotic dancer .
Her infamous `` Spider Dance '' ensnared King Ludwig I of Bavaria and she became his mistress .
`` She 's very interesting if you look into all the details around her ; she was definitely shady , '' Volbeat frontman Michael Poulsen told BraveWords.com .
`` I just thought , how the hell ?
If you read about her , there 's so many things that come up .
She 's been all around , flirting with a lot of royal men .
At that time , having the kind of act that she had with her Spider Dance ... people were coming to her show , the miners were throwing their gold in front of her because she would be lifting up her skirt so they could see everything .
She was very controversial , but at the same time she was very beautiful and all the men were totally drawn to her .
It 's a very interesting character . ''
Singer-songwriter Joanna Newsom also tells the story of Lola Montez in her 11-minute epic `` Have One On Me . ''
Volbeat debuted the song during the band 's appearance in June 2013 at Germany 's Rock Am Ring Festival .
Poulsen told Classic Rock magazine about his writing for the Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies album : `` I wanted to bring in some characters that people were n't so familiar with or maybe had heard a little about , '' he said .
`` Lola Montez is not a typical character , the same with Pearl Hart .
I wanted to find characters who were a little bit deranged . ''
`` Mostly the inspiration came from books as I read a lot , '' he continued .
`` The same with Black Bart who is one of my favourite characters .
Of those three names they are all real characters who were alive . ''
