`` Drink In My Hand '' singer Eric Church penned this song about the importance of living your life with Michael Heeney and Jeff Hyde .
Brice explained why he decided to cut the tune for his sophomore album : `` When I first heard it , I thought , ` That song makes its point in a very cool Garth kind of a way . '
It says what I want to tell people about who I am -- that maybe I 'm a little reckless sometimes , but I 'd rather take a couple of years off my life than take the life out of my years .
Life is too short .
Who knows how long I 'm going to be here ?
If there 's one thing I 've learned it 's that you will regret the things you did n't do more than the ones that you did .
So get off your tail , have fun and live life a little bit .
That 's the message .
Then instrumentally , I got really excited when I thought about putting a hammer dulcimer on it .
I just love how it turned out . ''
Eric Church originally wrote this for his Chief album but could n't fit it on , so he let Brice record the tune .
