Keith wrote this song with his frequent collaborator , Nashville singer-songwriter Bobby Pinson .
He told the story of the song : `` Bobby came over one time and said , ' I wrote a song today that you ought to cut , ' and I knew the song he was talking about , it was a hit .
I started strumming it with a little different groove and had this real cool little acoustic sound going on , and I spit a bunch of words out .
In about 30 seconds I had this , ` if women come a dime a dozen I ai n't got a penny .
Some guys are getting ' way too much , some guys do n't get any .
But if I had a nickel for every time I 'd had enough , I 'd still be busted and heart broken still be tryin ' to fall in love . '
It 's really up tempo , traditional , fun country song .
Then we put some verses to it and screwed it down .
It 's one of my favorite things on the album . ''
