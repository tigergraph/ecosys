Jewel said on her website that she wrote this song after an argument with her husband , nine-time world champion pro rodeo cowboy , Ty Murray .
She explained : `` I 'm probably the only nerd that gets a chuckle from this , but what the heck .
This is one of my favorite story lyrics .
I wrote it after Ty and I got in a big fight one day .
I was so mad ; I had to count to ten before I totally lost it .
Love is a peculiar thing - it can inspire the best and the worst feeling because we let someone in so close to us .
But the reward is so great too , that always keeping that perspective is key , no matter how intense a fleeting fight can be .
I wrote this song as a sort of ` count to ten ' experience that can help ease you out of bad feelings , and even remind you to be thankful for their best qualities too .
I like the opening line ` whoever said love is easy , must have never been in love ' - I think everyone can relate ! ''
