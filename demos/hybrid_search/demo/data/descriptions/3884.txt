During an interview with Les Claypool , MusicRadar commented this song 's ending is `` very Pink Floyd . ''
The Primus frontman explained : `` Oh , yeah .
-LSB- laughs -RSB- That was intentional .
We go into space during that part .
I call it ` Space . '
One of my intentions on this record was to go into space on a nightly basis .
I wanted to create parts on this record where we can go off on tangents live .
I can turn around and play to the screen for 15 minutes -- it 'll be great ! ''
