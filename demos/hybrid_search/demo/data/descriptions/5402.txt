The lyrics to this song were written by the Scotish poet Robert Burns in the 1700s .
It is contrasting the death of the character Mary with the flow of the river Afton , which is a metaphor for the passage of time .
Chris Thile of Nickel Creek was laughing about this at a live performance because when he wrote the melody -LRB- which is in a major key -RRB- , he was n't sure whether she was dead or not .
