This song reflects the band 's party lifestyle and also was inspired by the inability of a friend of the quartet to score with the ladies .
Drummer Stix Zadinia explained to AntiMusic : `` He was always trying to get laid .
He was n't very sexy and did n't have spandex or long hair so he relied on honing his verbal game with the ladies.One night , at an Iron Maiden concert in Los Angeles , we stumbled out into the parking lot only to bump into a pack of hot sluts .
As they were scoping us out , they inquired as to what we were going to do for the rest of the night .
With no plans set yet , and nowhere to go , our friend declared that he had no idea what was going on tonight but instead exclaimed , ' I know where a party is tomorrow night ! '
Thus began decades of ridicule and pure enjoyment at the expense of our friend . ''
It was guitarist Satchel who came up with the idea for the chorus , whilst the odd time signature in the pre chorus was influenced by Stix 's `` early exposure to Robert Fripp and Marillion . ''
