This is a track from the second full length studio album by Neon Trees , Picture Show , which takes its name from the band 's love of movies .
`` The movie that 's on repeat in the lounge that 's always playing right now is Silence Of The Lambs , which is kind of an odd choice and not very reflective of what any of the record 's gon na sound like , '' frontman Tyler Glenn told Rolling Stone , in a pre-release interview .
`` But there 's actually a song in the movie -LSB- `` Goodbye Horses '' -RSB- by Q. Lazzarus and that 's just become the anthem song of this album .
It 's one of the coolest songs we 've ever heard . ''
During a behind the scenes look at the making of Picture Show , Tyler Glenn explained the record started with a concept .
`` The themes of the songs are a lot about playing pretend and so I thought that a movie theater would be a great way to kind of be a visual , '' he said .
`` It started back with the idea for the album being the ability that someone has to escape for two hours in someone else 's life . ''
The song contains a spoken-word passage that critics say recalls Madonna 's `` Vogue . ''
