Not to be confused with any later song of the same name , `` Two Sisters '' was written by Ray Davies and is also certainly based on the tempestuous relationship of two real brothers rather than two fictional sisters , namely him and Kinks lead guitarist Dave Davies .
Running to just 2 minutes 1 second , it is the third song on the band 's Something Else album , and has a distinctive sound due to the harpsichord .
