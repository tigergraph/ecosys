DragonForce recorded two versions of this track for their The Power Within album - a normal rock version and a quieter acoustic one .
During an interview on Roadrunner Records ' website , the band 's guitarist and songwriter Sam Totman explained the acoustic version : `` It was supposed to be a bonus track for the Japanese version or something , so we did n't really think anything of it , '' he said .
`` We were like , let 's do an acoustic version , because we did n't have time to write another whole song .
So it was either gon na be that or ` Cry Thunder ' - we were thinking about doing an acoustic version of ` Cry Thunder ' first , actually .
We thought we could do some kind of folky , sitting-around-the-campfire type of thing , which I think would have been cool , too .
But it ended up being ` Seasons , ' and when we recorded it , we thought , ` Oh , this is actually pretty cool , ' so let 's put it on the record .
Cause it shows that we 're not all about playing a million miles an hour ; we 've got a sensitive side .
-LSB- laughs -RSB- So yeah , it was n't supposed to be anything amazing , to be honest , but it turned out really cool . ''
The song 's montage video was filmed during a series of shows played to introduce new singer Marc Hudson to DragonForce 's fan base prior to the commencement of ` The Power Within ' World Tour .
They included performances at the 02 Arena in London and the Knockout Festival in Germany .
