Martin Johnson of Boys Like Girls said of this track : `` This song is about a relationship that relies on other things besides love to stay on its feet .
` Medication ' could be anything : sex , drugs , alcohol , prescriptions ... anything that changes your mindset to put you in a different place .
I know a lot of people that would n't hang out unless it 's in a partying , ` lets get f -- ked up ' kind of situation and I think that kind of sucks . ''
