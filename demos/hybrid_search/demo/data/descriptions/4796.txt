This Blues boogie is one of several tracks on Privateering to feature the harmonica playing of Kim Wilson of the Blues rockers The Fabulous Thunderbirds .
`` One of the most important things about the blues to me has always been the harp , '' said Knopfler .
`` Seeing Muddy Waters as a kid made a big impression on me , the harp was burbling away all the time , the band was swinging .
And to me the greatest modern exponent is Kim Wilson , he 's been my top man for many years , so it was really great to have him on board .
We hit it off straight away and got a great session going . ''
