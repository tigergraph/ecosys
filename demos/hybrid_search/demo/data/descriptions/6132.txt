Swim Deep is a four piece band from Birmingham UK consisting of vocalist Austin Williams , guitarist Tom ` Higgy ' Higgins , bassist Cavan McCarthy and drummer Zach Robinson .
This is their second single , which finds Williams proclaiming in the chorus , `` Do n't just dream in your sleep - it 's just lazy . ''
He explained to NME : `` It 's about doing all the s -- t you dream about in real life .
Me and Higgy worked in Morrisons -LRB- supermarket -RRB- , that 's where we met .
This is such a dream for us .
We keep pinching ourselves . ''
Williams told Digital Spy how the band came up with the album title .
`` We were in the van , '' he recalled , `` all pretty stoned , and I think we were listening to Radiohead .
We had n't discussed album names for a while , and I heard someone say , ` Where the hell are we ? '
and I was looking outside , thinking really deep , and said , ` Where the heaven are we ? '
We googled it straight away and it 's never been used ... Where you are is where you can make heaven out of , you 've got ta relish and take full advantage of such a space . ''
Williams recalled to Brum Notes Magazine the influence on this song of one of Hip-Hop 's biggest names .
`` Me and Zach -LSB- Robinson -RSB- were writing over the phone , '' he said .
`` I was listening to a lot of hip hop at that point -- a lot of Kanye West because he samples loads and I really like sampling .
Zach sent through this little loop that he 'd just made on the guitar and with the phone to my ear I put some chords over it .
That 's what I wanted to do at the time -- just make a real feel-good Kanye West song . ''
