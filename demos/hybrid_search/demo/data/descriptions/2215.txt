This song is about a fight between a guy and his girlfriend .
He knows he did something wrong , and is pleading with her not to leave .
The line , `` I lose myself in all these fights , I lose my sense of wrong and right '' indicates that he 's said something that greatly upset her .
Throughout the song , he repeats , `` It 's not over '' in an attempt to convince her not to go .
