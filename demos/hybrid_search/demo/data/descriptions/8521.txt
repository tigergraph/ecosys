This song was co-written and produced by the Suspex -LRB- Mitch Allan and Jason Evigan -RRB- - one of several tracks on Demi helmed by the production duo .
Evigan told MTV News : `` That 's a very timeless song .
We wrote it with Livvi Franc .
It 's like this lullaby that turns into this huge rock chorus , pop rock .
So the chorus kind of has that ` Heart Attack ' huge feel where these verses are very melodic and they 're swimming through almost like a ballerina thing . ''
