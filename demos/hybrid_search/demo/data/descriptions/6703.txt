Yeasayer are an experimental rock trio comprising keyboardist/vocalist Chris Keating , guitarist Anand Wilder , and bassist Ira Wolf Tuton .
Keating and Wilder both grew up in Baltimore and after arriving at the University of Pennsylvania and hooked up with Anand 's cousin , Tuton , who is from Philadelphia .
The trio later relocated to Brooklyn , New York where they are now based .
Wilder told Drowned in Sound about the song : `` That one was deliberately a palette cleanser from the last era of Yeasayer , we 're reversing expectations , you know ?
We used to have tonnes of organic vocals , now we have one lead vocal being processed by a machine , a digital vocal peddle .
The song was really written by Chris -LSB- Keating -RSB- , and we added the production to it ; we really wanted to get the sound of this futuristic , Orwellian work camp and the noises that you hear at prison camps .
So there 's a pick axe hit and it 's actually a guitar , I 'd be hitting a guitar with a drumstick ` plink ! '
to make that interesting sound .
The whole track was slowed down half speed , that 's how we get such a subby sound . ''
This is the opening track from Yeasayer 's second album , Odd Blood , which is the follow-up to 2007 's All Hour Cymbals .
Keating told MTV News : `` We were pretty determined to have it first on the record .
I like the idea of starting the record like that , as a departure point from the last record , especially the last song on the last record , which was very choral , and then all of a sudden , you 're transported to further into the future , and you 're on some off-world colony that has crazy percussion and slowed-down vocals .
We sang harmonies through a fan , sang into the pitch thing and tried to sing it live . ''
