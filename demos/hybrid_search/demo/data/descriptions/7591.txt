American singer-songwriter Andy Grammer started his music career as a street musician busking on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica , California .
Grammer closes his debut album with this tribute to his busker colleagues .
He explained to Artist Direct : `` It 's a true story of all my friends from street performing .
I played out on the streets for years so I became friends with each one of those guys .
Those are real situations in the song .
I 'd be out there taking notes on what it was like so I could write a song like this .
It 's probably one of my favorites .
That is my ode to street performing .
It was the last song I recorded .
I wrote it while we were recording the record , and I wanted to make sure we got it on there . ''
