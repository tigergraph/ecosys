More come-ons from Rihanna on this uptempo jam , which finds the Bajan singer insisting , with her usual bravado , `` I 've been a bad girl , Daddy . ''
Some critics have described it as part two to her hit single , `` Rude Boy . ''
Later on , Ri displays some rare vulnerability , when she confesses , Take a peek at the girl I hide / I 'll let you in on a dirty secret / I just wan na be loved . ''
The song was written and produced by Rob Swire and Gareth McGrillen of the Australian drum and bass and electronic rock band Pendulum along with frequent Rihanna collaborators , the Norwegian production duo StarGate .
Pendulum are one of the most successful bands of their genre and they became the first drum and bass act to record a # 1 album in the UK , when Immersion topped the chart in May 2010 .
