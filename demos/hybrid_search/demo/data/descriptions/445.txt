Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls wrote this song .
In 2006 , she told us : `` That was written a long , long time ago .
Sometimes when I think about that song , it feels pretty adolescent to me .
Some of the images are overwrought .
But it 's sort of a testament to my parents , and to their love , which I know is kind of a rare thing in this world , because I know that a lot of people really struggle with their parents .
But it was always my own constant battle with my inner darkness , and the prince of darkness , obviously , the diabolical force .
So it 's about light and darkness , and how darkness , you can feel sometimes like it almost is going to pull you under But there are people in your life who can save you , and not just my parents , but friends or support systems .
In the end , it 's an affirmative statement - I 'm not going to be a pawn for the prince of darkness .
I have the strength to find my light rather than to dwell in my darkness . ''
