The American Kid album deals with death in a number of ways .
This song tells the story of a young soldier who is sent to fight in Iraq .
He makes it back to America , but is traumatized by what he saw there .
Griffin explained the song 's backstory to The Daily Telegraph : `` There was a marine who had returned home from Iraq to Austin , Texas , where I live , '' she said .
`` A lot of kids got lured in by the marketing campaign and joined up and they were n't really sure who they were fighting .
It was after 9/11 and the Twin Towers had come down and these boys were going to go to fight .
For me , that was a very terrifying time to be in America and to be an American .
Lots of our soldiers came home really damaged after they realised they were harming people they did n't know . ''
`` I read a story in a paper about a family who were trying to get a young family member out of the military and get him some mental health care .
That did n't prove possible and he ended up dead and it was n't clear whether it was a suicide .
So I wrote the song to get inside that kid , if I could . ''
This song is one of the most powerful songs that she has written against war , telling the story of a soldier who becomes the product of a war far more contemporary than the one her father had fought in : World War II .
The title says something about who the man was and who many soldiers of later times represent .
They are not bad men , but are being forced to fight unjust wars , often because they signed up without understanding the consequences .
