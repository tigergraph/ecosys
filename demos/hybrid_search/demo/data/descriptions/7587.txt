British indie rock band Kaiser Chiefs ' fourth studio album The Future Is Medieval was released through the band 's website on June 3 , 2011 .
In effect the world 's first bespoke album , fans are able to create their own version of the record by choosing their favorite 10 tracks from the selection of 20 on offer .
One-minute excerpts allow them to make their selections and each song is represented by an object .
`` There 's a lyrical significance to every object , '' frontman Ricky Wilson explained to The Guardian , `` although some are more oblique than others .
`` After creating their own album , people can then share their version of the record with other fans , and earn # 1 each time it is purchased by someone else .
This tender tune finds Wilson addressing his seriously ill father , backed by a string quartet .
`` And if you will have me / I want to be the son that I was / And if you will have me / I want to be the boy in the photograph , '' he sings .
