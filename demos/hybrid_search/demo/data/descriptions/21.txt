11:59 was the first major label studio album for Ryan Star , who was a popular contestant on the TV show Rock Star : Supernova .
Star 's music has appeared in a number of movies and TV shows , and this one showed up in a 2009 episode of the Soap Opera One Life To Live .
In our interview with Ryan Star , it became clear that he 's a hopeless romantic , and many of his songs are inspired by his girlfriend Hallie .
Said Star : `` If you ever saw the movie Big Fish , I just see it like that .
It 's this whimsical idea , and I see like a Tim Burton video with it : it 's about these two lovers saying that , in anything , you might fall .
We might fall , or we might just fall in love .
You know ?
It 's like there 's no written way to say that this has to happen bad or good or anything .
It could just happen.And it 's just about lovers getting through life together .
It 's a whole life span .
And what they 'll do to make ends meet , and what they 'll do to grow old together to realize that they found truth in each other .
That might be my most favorite lyrical song .
I love that one a lot . ''
