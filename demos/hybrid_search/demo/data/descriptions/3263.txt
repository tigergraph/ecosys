This is one of the most overtly sexual songs Swift has ever written as she sings of heavy petting leading her down a treacherous slope .
`` That song was about a person that I knew , '' she told USA Today , `` from the minute I saw him , that it would end in fiery , burning wreckage .
There 's something about that magnetic draw that does n't really let up .
You walk toward it anyway . ''
Swift penned this tune with former Semisonic frontman Dan Wilson , who also co-wrote Adele 's `` Someone Like You . ''
Wilson is one of several songwriters that Swift reached out to write with her on Red .
She told Billboard magazine : `` Dan Wilson , back to his Semisonic days , has been a huge inspiration .
When your inspirations become your collaborators , it becomes something really true to the music that you like . ''
