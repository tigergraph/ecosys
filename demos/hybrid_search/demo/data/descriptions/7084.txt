Whilst this song finds Taylor promising to `` Stay Stay Stay '' with her current boyfriend , she still takes the opportunity to throw a few disses at her exes .
`` Before you I only dated self-indulgent takers , '' she sings , '' who took all of their problems out on me . ''
The song ends with Swift collapsing into a fit of giggles .
The Pennsylvania native told Rolling Stone how Red showcases the wide range of emotions she has experienced in recent years .
`` I went through a few roller coasters , '' she said .
`` Trying to chronicle each step of the way was challenging , because you go to some really dark places with the lyrics .
Then in the next track , you 're talking about how amazing it is to meet somebody new . ''
Swift told MTV News how she transforms her emotions into songs .
`` When I 'm writing a song , I 'm so in that zone that it 's really sort of a trance I go into , '' she explained , `` and I 'm just kind of thinking about what I would say to this person that I 'm writing the song about if I could just say whatever I wanted to them right now ; that 's kind of where I go in my head .
And then the next thing is , I edit the song for a couple of days in my head and make sure that every line is as tight as I want it to be . ''
