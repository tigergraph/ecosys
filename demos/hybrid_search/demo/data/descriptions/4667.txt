On both this autobiographical song and the touching reminiscence , `` I 'm Crying -LRB- Mother 's Tears -RRB- , '' Jones speaks directly of her family .
In this song the free-spirited singer talks of her how she takes after her mother -LRB- Williams is her mother 's maiden name -RRB- , rather than her strict , religious father , the Reverend Robert Jones .
This was written by Grace Jones , together with duo Wendy and Lisa , who are best known for their collaborations with Prince in the 1980s .
This song explains that Jones ' musical genes come from her mother 's side .
Her mom -LRB- born Marjorie Williams -RRB- has a lovely voice and her grandfather from her mother 's side was a musician who played with Nat King Cole .
Marjorie can be heard singing the hymn `` Amazing Grace '' towards the end of this song .
She also did backing vocals on Jones 1982 single , `` My Jamaican Guy , '' but could n't be acknowledged , for fear of upsetting the church elders .
