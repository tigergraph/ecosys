AOL asked Keith whether this song , about a guy who thinks he 's basically misunderstood , was semi-autobiographical .
He replied : `` You ask any guy 's wife or girlfriend , and she can find some things she do n't like about him , but that do n't make him a bad guy .
When me and Bobby Pinson wrote the song together , we wanted to be as clever as we could in saying , ` Yeah , so what ?
I drink whiskey from a cheap paper cup . '
And then , I 'll drink a pot of joe after I sober up kind of stuff .
So there 's little things that you 're probably not going to like about me , honey , but that do n't make me a bad guy .
We just wanted to be as clever as we could and really hook a great melody that sounds like me .
My favorite line that seals it up is , ` I 'm only good as I got ta be . ' ''
In the album 's press release Keith explained : `` We had an idea about a guy who lives a party lifestyle , and it 's kind of a tongue-in-cheek , ` Hey , this is all the stuff I do .
So what ? '
Works great as the first song on the album , and the title track . ''
