Mat Kearney told the story of this song to Relevant magazine : `` I wrote that on in the back seat of a van headed away from a dirty show in Indianapolis .
I had met this girl named Annie who told me a story about how she had to either leave her hometown or get swallowed by it .
Leaving is hard when you are misunderstood , especially by your family .
A year later , Annie became Kearney 's wife .
His song `` Hey Mama '' is about her .
