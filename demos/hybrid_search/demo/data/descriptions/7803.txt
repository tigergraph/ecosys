This is one of several tracks that talk about sci-fi situations .

We 're just talking about situations we 've been in and things that have happened over the years with people . ''
Pete Loeffler explained in press materials that the title Sci-Fi Crimes was inspired by some off-road adventures with one `` friend , '' whom Pete describes as `` this really off-the-wall character , who was driving us around , who believes so whole-heartedly in aliens and UFOs that the subject just really piqued my interest .
