According to Cave , the songs on Push The Sky were composed from `` Googling curiosities -LSB- and -RSB- being entranced by exotic Wikipedia entries , '' with a focus on `` how on the internet profoundly significant events , momentary fads and mystically-tinged absurdities sit side-by-side . ''
These digital fixations are prominent on this track , which finds Cave crooning , `` Wikipedia is heaven .
When you do n't want to remember anymore . ''
