Blindside lead singer Christian Lindskog explained to jesusfreakhideout.com : `` Hope is not what you have done - but in the relationships you have formed - it is being known .
I went through a period of depression after coming back from South Africa all throughout the writing of this record .
When we were writing this song , I was in the studio and Tomas was recording the bass part and the producer Lasse and I were dancing around the studio for fun .
Then it stopped being funny and became a really powerful moment .
I do n't think Lasse or anyone else in that room noticed anything different but I felt the weight of depression lifting from me .
Losing myself in that dance was a very special moment . ''
