Justin Vernon , aka Bon Iver , performed this song a capella , with the help of some Auto-Tune studio effects .
He explained to Guy Raz on NPR Music : `` This for me was a way to extend my voice or to experiment with different techniques , or just sounds .
It was really freeing for me to do , and I 'm really happy it 's the last song on the EP . ''
