This track closes House Of Gold And Bones : Part 2 , the second half of a double concept album about a man called The Human struggling to find his place in the world .
Frontman Corey Taylor 's narrative is intended to be universal , speaking to everyone 's hopes and fears .
He told Artist Direct about this cut : `` That was the last song we put together before we went into the studio , '' he said .
`` Thematically , it was almost tailor-made for us to do it this way .
It was basically made up of flipping certain riffs from ` Gone Sovereign ' and ` Absolute Zero ' and sort of playing them backwards in a weird way .
If you listen to it thematically , you can see where some of it backwards , but you have to really listen to it . ''
`` We needed the outro , '' he continued .
`` We needed that moment where the human has made his decision and he 's sticking with it no matter what that decision is .
That 's all open to the reader .
You need that moment .
You need the big crescendo .
You need the final act to draw you in and leave you with that closure .
That was the perfect song to do it with . ''
