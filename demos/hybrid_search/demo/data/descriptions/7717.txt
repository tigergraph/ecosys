This song was inspired by an exhibit of the same name the band saw at the Chicago Peace Museum while on tour in 1983 .
The exhibit featured artwork from Japanese victims of the Hiroshima bombing .
The Chicago Peace Museum also had a Martin Luther King exhibit , which would inspire U2 's song `` Pride -LRB- In The Name Of Love -RRB- . ''
This was written after U2 decided to use `` The Unforgettable Fire '' as the title to the album .
In the beginning of the song , from :04 to :07 seconds , you can hear Larry Mullen Jr. start to hit his drumsticks early .
Immediately after , he mutters out `` S-it . ''
Then , at :22 seconds , he starts to drum at the correct time .
The small glitch has never been removed from the album nor its inclusions on ` Best of ' CDs .
