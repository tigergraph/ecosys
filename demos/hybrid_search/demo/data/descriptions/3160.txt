This was produced by Atlanta hip-hop record producer DJ Toomp .
He is best known for his work with the rapper T.I. and this was his first R&B credit .
The chorus of DeBarge 's 1983 album track `` Stay With Me '' is the foundation of this track .
It is married with the hook from Hill Street Blues theme music .
Ashanti 's hit single `` Foolish '' also borrowed from the same DeBarge track .
In addition , `` Stay With Me '' was previously sampled on the Notorious B.I.G 's # 2 hit `` One More Chance/Stay With Me . ''
The song 's title is a phrase said by a Vietnamese prostitute in the film Full Metal Jacket , which was later sampled by 2 Live Crew 1989 on their controversial hit `` Me So Horny . ''
The explicit nature of 2 Live Crew 's song and others on the accompanying album led to an initially successful prosecution of the group on obscenity charges , which was overturned on appeal .
Despite a lack of airplay the single reached # 26 in the charts and its success resulted in a growing concern over the explicit lyrics of 2 Live Crew and other rap acts .
Carey : '' ` Lovin ' U Long Time ' was one of the last songs I wrote for this album .
I sat down to write it and thought ` let me just make this a care-free record . '
It 's kind of a party record to me , just like not caring too much about anything else that 's going on but you living in the moment . ''
