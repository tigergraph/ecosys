This waltz-time shuffle is the only Cash original on American VI : Ai n't No Grave .
The song 's title is the scripture reference for the New Testament verse that reads : `` Where , O Death , is your victory ?
Where , O Death , is your sting ? ''
The passage is an explanation by St. Paul as to how death is not a source of fear or dread to the Christian thanks to Christ 's sacrifice on the Cross .
Johnny Cash : `` I wrote that song in Jamaica , It took me about a month to write .
I mean , I just took my time .
That 's the way to make it , take your time .
You do n't do anything in a hurry .
If you can do it tomorrow , you put it off 'til tomorrow . ''
