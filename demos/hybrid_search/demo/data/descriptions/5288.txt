This track from British alternative dance band Friendly Fires ' second album Pala finds singer Ed Macfarlane singing about jetting to the tropics for vacation .
He explained the songs meaning to the NME : `` The lyrics on ` Hawaiian Air ' are about having a horrific flight to Hawaii , but then that sigh of relief when you touch down .
`` He continued : `` The line ` Watching a film with a talking dog , ' is because every time we 're on a plane , there 's always Marley And Me or these really s -- t Owen Wilson comedies .
It just adds to the turmoil of being on a flight in general . ''
