This song is about the state of confusion that comes from seeing your friends getting married .
Vocalist and lyricist Charlie Fink explained to The Daily Telegraph : '' ` Lifetime ' was a reminder for me that I spend so much time on the road , and so much time away from London , that when my friend said he was getting married I became aware of how much I had drifted from my friends , and how little I knew what was going on in anyone 's lives . ''
This was the first song written for Heart of Nowhere .
Charlie Fink told Q magazine that the song 's subject matter of a friend of his getting engaged was where the inspiration for the whole record started .
He explained : `` A lot of the album is about the end of adolescence and memories of friendship .
We 'd come back from tour and find out s -- t has changed since we were last here .
I found myself at that point in life where you 're becoming an adult .
That was the starting point for the record . ''
