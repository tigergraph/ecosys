This song is about Elvis Presley .
Here 's some lyric analysis : `` Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high '' - Jimmy Rogers , an early Blues singer , influencing Elvis -LRB- the baby -RRB- at an early age .
The Victrola is the record player , played loudly .

`` Black velvet and that little boy 's smile '' - You can buy a black velvet Elvis painting at any respectable yard sale .
Early female fans were drawn to his `` Little boy smile . ''
`` Black velvet with that slow southern style '' - Elvis delivered some of his songs with slow , undulating hips .

-LRB- thanks , Ken - Lasalle , Canada -RRB- Myles won a Grammy award for Best Female Rock Performance for this song , along with several Juno Awards .
Additionally , this won a Diamond award for sales in excess of 1,000,000 in Canada , the only time an artist has won this for her debut record .
ASCAP awarded the song a ` Millionaire Award ' in 2005 for over 4 million radio plays in the USA .
This was a Canadian production : the song was written by Canadian musicians David Tyson and Christopher Ward , and Myles is from Toronto .
Alannah Myles was her first album , and it was a huge hit in Canada , becoming the top-selling debut album in Canadian history .
In a CBC Newsworld interview Myles revealed she was robbed and cheated by her record company and amazingly she only received her first ever royalty check on April 1 , 2008 .
She signed that record deal when she was young and naive and so far she has paid $ 7 million on expenditures for her first three albums , all deducted out of her take .
So when she should have been dining out on the success of this song and her other recordings instead she 's been living in poverty , at times not knowing how she was going to pay her rent .
