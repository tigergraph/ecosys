This was an outtake from the band 's 2007 album Roots & Echoes .
Frontman James Skelly explained on his record label 's website why it was n't originally included on the album : `` I 'd written it quite early on during the album sessions and I really wish we 'd put it on the album to be honest and I 'm quite gutted that we did n't .
It was written as this weird kind of Leonard Cohen song , we got it together quickly , it sounded good in the batch of first tunes for the LP and we did a demo and it sounded good , we recorded it with Ian Broudie and then with -LSB- producer -RSB- Craig -LSB- Silvey -RSB- , which is the version on The Singles Collection .
We just over listened to it and because of that it never made the album and it 's better than some of the songs on it .
I wanted it to be a single but it did n't get a great reaction -LRB- laughs -RRB- . ''
Skelly explained that the story told in the song is similar to `` Eleanor Rigby '' by fellow Liverpool band the Beatles .
He said : `` The story is like Eleanor Rigby .
It 's about this woman in Liverpool who fed the pigeons and she 'd talk to herself and I 'd think is she there or am I the only one who sees her .
The image stuck in my head . ''
