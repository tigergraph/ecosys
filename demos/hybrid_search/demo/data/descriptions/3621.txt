This song deals with the events leading up to the death in 2003 of Dr. David Kelly , a biological warfare expert for the British government and a former United Nations weapons inspector .
His evidence caused a political scandal as it raised questions about Saddam Hussein 's alleged possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction , the justification for the British Government to order the invasion of Iraq .
His death , which took place on Harrowdown Hill in Oxford days after his testimonial before a parliamentary committee where he charged with investigating the scandal , was ruled a suicide .
This song was originally considered for inclusion on Radiohead 's Hail To The Thief album , but it was felt it was not going to work with the band .
