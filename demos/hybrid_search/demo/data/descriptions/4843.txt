This song shares the same lyrical theme as a number of the other tracks on Battle Studies - love as a battle field .
Mayer told Rolling Stone that though he did n't set out to make a concept album , as it developed , he found the songs ' war theme oddly appealing .
`` I was loving the war theme , the battle theme .
The militaristic , vulgar , violent side of a relationship on the down slope , '' he said .
`` The record starts out sort of like the sun is out , then it gets darker .
And then the sun comes back out at the end . ''
