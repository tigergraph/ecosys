Vocalist Kevin Parker recorded the sound of girls laughing in order to create a feeling of being left out at a party for this song .
If you listen carefully you will hear their guffaws on this track .
He explained to NME : `` For me it goes back to that voyeuristic thing , of being like you 're listening to a party but you 're just not involved .
It sounds like fun and you can hear people talking about something but you ca n't hear what it is .
And there 's these girls laughing , having a great time .
That 's what the sound of that last five minutes of that song is . ''
