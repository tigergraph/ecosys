Guitarist Benji Madden explained the inspiration for this tribute to Good Charlotte 's fans in an track by track interview with Alternative Press : `` This was inspired by responses to a blog I posted on our website in January explaining about how we decided to restart the album .
I had lost a little faith and was feeling down about the music industry in general .
The replies to the blog from the GCFAM were so uplifting and encouraging , I wanted to give something back .
That 's also why I wanted it to be the first song on the album . ''
Benji described this to Alternative Press as being `` in the same spirit as their 2002 single ` Hold On . ' ''
