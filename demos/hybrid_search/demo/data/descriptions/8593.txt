Dappy takes aim at the likes of Simon Cowell and X Factor winners Alexandra Burke and Joe McElderry on this sweary freestyle track , which is a follow up to `` Tarzan , '' a song he dropped in August 2011 .
The mocking tune kicked off a family squabble on Twitter , as Dappy 's cousin , Tulisa , was not impressed by her N-Dubz colleague lashing out at her X Factor boss Cowell .
`` Just puttin it out there . .
dont involve me in dappy 's latest hype , I do n't condone it in anyway .
N its a shame I 'm not around 2 control him -LRB- sic -RRB- , '' she tweeted provoking a series of exchanges between the pair .
Dappy was forced to apologise after the song 's music video originally featured the message `` Free Leo Chindamo '' in the opening credits , a reference to the teenage gang member convicted of killing head teacher Philip Lawrence .
Chindamo was jailed again in 2011 after breaching the terms of his license by meeting a gang member , breaking a curfew and failing a breath test .
Dappy explained that he was n't aware of Chindamo 's past and he knew his brother when he was young .
The N-Dubz star promised to hand over the royalty payments from the track to anti-crime charity Nacro .
The song 's music video sees a person wearing an Alexandra Burke mask being strangled by a man clad in a Cowell mask .
Dappy and Tulisa 's bandmate Fazer makes a cameo appearance in the clip .
