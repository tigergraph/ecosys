Lead Singer Corey Taylor explained to Kerrang !
July 19 , 2008 this song 's origins came from a speech he heard .
He said : `` I was over at -LRB- percussionist -RRB- Clown 's old house and he pulled up a speech by -LRB- former US Vice President -RRB- Spiro Agnew given in 1970 -LRB- the infamous An Effete Corps of Impudent Snobs speech directed at Vietnam War protesters -RRB- .
And when we started putting this album together , that 's what we wanted to use as an intro .
So I took it and manipulated it and f-ked it up .
But then I played it for Clown and he was like , ` That 's cool , but would n't it be better if you took it and made your own deal about it ? ' .
So I did . ''
