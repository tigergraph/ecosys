Rufus Wainwright combines with JAPW vocalist Joan Wasser on this song reflecting on the state of the nation .
Wasser had in mind her recent loss of her mother to cancer when she wrote this .
She explained to the Independent newspaper June 6 , 2008 : '' ` To America ' is about the relentlessness , the ruthlessness of disease .
And how it has no feelings .
And it just goes until it 's done .
I also had America represent one 's mother .
Because it feels like my country has a disease .
And I 'm looking forward to some sort of relief from that disease .
I 'm not expecting a miracle .
Just a return to some semblance of democracy . ''
