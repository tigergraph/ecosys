This song finds singer-bassist Oliver Sim broodingly lamenting , `` Why do I refuse you ? ''
Unusually for The xx it finds Sim singing on his own without singer-guitarist Romy Madley Croft .
DJ-producer Jamie Smith told Spin magazine it is , `` a song Ollie started .
We wanted it to show his strength , especially as his voice and ability to write has gotten so much stronger .
`` Madley Croft added : '' -LSB- ` Fiction ' -RSB- is something that I loved and I thought very much that it did n't need me on the song .
I really feel that it 's -LSB- Oliver 's -RSB- moment to shine . ''
The song 's music video was directed by Young Replicant and shot in Palm Springs , Florida during The xx 's early 2013 tour across North America .
The clip features Sim performing the track while wandering about and dancing outdoors under a full moon .
His bandmates had decided very early on that the bassist would be the star of the clip .
`` We love to be really involved in our videos , and the idea came out of a conversation , '' Madley Croft explained to MTV News .
`` I really wanted it to be all about Oliver , really , as it should be ; that 's his song on the album , ` Angels ' is my song , so it should be about him ... The idea of him performing a bit more was a big focus . ''
