Frontman and songwriter Michael Angelakos wrote this song right after he proposed to his girlfriend .
Angelakos told NME that he felt that he needed to re-propose to his fianc√©e after recording Gosammer , `` because -LRB- making -RRB- this record totally negated the romance ... I feel terrible about it .
The timing was off , I completely screwed the whole thing up . ''
