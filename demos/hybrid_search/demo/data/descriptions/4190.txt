This is the last song in what Eddie Vedder calls the `` Momma-Son '' trilogy .
It continues the story that begins with `` Alive , '' where a boy learns his dad is actually his stepfather , and continues with `` Once , '' where the boy goes crazy and kills people .
In `` Footsteps , '' he is sentenced to death and looking back at his wasted life from a jail cell .
Chris Cornell from Soundgarden recorded his own vocals over the instrumental track for this song , which became the Temple of the Dog song `` Times Of Trouble . ''
Temple of the Dog was formed by Cornell , Gossard , Ament and Mike McCready as a tribute to Andrew Wood , the lead singer Mother Love Bone ; Gossard and Ament were in the band when Wood died of a heroin overdose .
Eddie Vedder contributed vocals to the Temple of the Dog song `` Hunger Strike '' on the day he flew in to meet his new bandmates for the first time .
Guitarist Stone Gossard wrote the music as part of an instrumental demo before the band had a lead singer ; he called the song `` Troubled Times . ''
Gossard and Jeff Ament were in a promising band called Mother Love Bone , which disbanded when their lead singer died in March , 1990 .
Teaming with Mike McCready , they asked Jack Irons to join on drums , and although he could n't do it , he thought Vedder might make a great lead singer for the group and delivered the demo to him , which got Eddie the job when they heard the vocals he added to the tracks .
The three songs ended up sounding very much like the demos after they were recorded for the album .
