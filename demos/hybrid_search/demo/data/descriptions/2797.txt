Relapse was Eminem 's first studio album for over four years .
The break was caused by the rapper being holed up in Detroit getting over his dependence on sleeping pills and painkillers .
On this song , Eminem claims he became a drug addict because of his Valium-popping mother , Debbie Nelson .
Shady has recorded previous unflattering records about his mom , -LRB- check out Cleanin ' Out My Closet -RRB- , with whom he has an acrimonious relationship .
However this track is the first response he has made publicly since the publication of his mom 's book My Son Marshall , My Son Eminem : Setting the Record Straight on My Life as Eminem 's Mother .
In her tome , Nelson claims that Marshall Mathers -LRB- Eminem -RRB- was a shy mama 's boy who reinvented himself as white trailer trash with a crazy welfare mom in order to succeed in rap .
