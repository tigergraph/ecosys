According to frontman Dexter Holland , this song `` came up quickly . ''
He explained to Spinner : `` We wanted to write something straightforward .
The idea of trying to make your own way , do your own thing , and be your own person but feeling pressured to be somebody else or act like somebody else is a universal feeling .
You could talk about it when you 're in high school all the way up to the corporate world .
It 's about resisting it .
There 's an old school punk sentiment to resist the pressure of what people tell you to be or tell you to do .
You 're deciding for yourself what you want to be . ''
The song features a drum loop , which according to guitarist Noodle , `` is very not punk , but it works well . ''
He told Spinner : `` I really like that .
It 's a cool juxtaposition , and it adds some tension to that song .
You might enjoy somebody 's company , but they 're really not so reciprocal .
You end up trying to please somebody and all you do is end up losing yourself in a relationship .
Some relationships can be toxic , and it may take a while to realize it . ''
