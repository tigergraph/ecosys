The track is the first single from Texan four-piece hard rock band Drowning Pool 's self-titled fourth studio album .
Guitarist C.J. Pierce told Artist Direct about this anthemic song : `` It 's funny how that happened .
When I first came up with the riff , we were on tour , and I really did n't think it was a song that would make the record .
It 's a fun song , it had a cool like groove to it , but I was like , ` Is this Drowning Pool or what is this ? '
Whenever we played it , everybody was in a good mood .
From there , for whatever crazy reason , it moved to the front seat .
It was one of the first tracks that we recorded in the studio and the first one that the label jumped on .
So , with that being said , we set the bar really high where everything else that we did afterwards had to beat it .
Since that was the first one , everything after that had to beat it .
If you like ` Feel Like I Do , ' you 're going to love the rest of this record . ''
Lead singer Ryan McCombs explained that the song reflects a tough period in his life during which he went through a divorce , moved out of his home and lost his father : `` It was kind of feeling like everything was wrong and everything was crashing down and I was , I could n't make a right move , and feeling swallowed up by everything .
And then all of a sudden sitting back and going , ` But you know what ?
Who does n't feel this way ? '
This was kind of that moment with this song that I went , ` You know what though ?
Woe is me , who cares about hearing about that .
We all go through it . ''
