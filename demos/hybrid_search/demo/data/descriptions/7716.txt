Caitlin Rose wrote this sentimental ballad after reading a 1968 essay called Marrying Absurd by Joan Didlon about the Las Vegas wedding business .
She explained to UK newspaper The Sun : `` I was almost instantly inspired and it became kind of my foray back into writing .
She just gave me a creative boost .
It was all honest , but not non-judgmental .
Descriptive , but not schmaltzy .
That 's a style I strive for and also relate to . ''
