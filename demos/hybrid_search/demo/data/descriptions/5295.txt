This is the title track from the seventh full-length album by the San Diego-based rock band Switchfoot .
Switchfoot lead singer/lyricist Jon Foreman told NewReleaseTuesday about this song : `` This is a subject matter that I speak of with holy reverence .
Having grown up on the East Coast I know firsthand of the houses lost , of the dreams turned into nightmares .
I take my shoes off and recognize that this is a matter that is dear to our nation , especially of late - with every passing hurricane season .
Last year , with Habitat for Humanity we helped to build a house for a woman who lost everything in Hurricane Katrina .
The hurricane had taken her city , her house , and her leg .
As she relocated to Baton Rouge and learned how to walk as an amputee , her mantra was this : ' I walked out of my house and my life in New Orleans on my own legs , I 'm going to walk into this one the same way . '
This is the spirit that I wanted to capture with this song , and moreover with this record .
The storms of life might take my house , my loved ones , or even my life - but they can not silence my love .
Yes , the reactionary impulses of hate , fear , and despair really are defenseless against the storms of this life .
And yet , this selfless love really might be stronger than death .
Perhaps , the kingdom of the heavens really is at hand , ready to give , ready to love .
And with this love as my song I will overcome .
In surrender to divine love I will find my strength .
` Let no debt remain outstanding , except the continuing debt to love another . ' ''
