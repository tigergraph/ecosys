`` Make 'Em Laugh '' is performed by Donald O'Connor in the classic Singin ' In The Rain .
Although Gene Kelly was the star of this film , O'Connor was an incredibly gifted performer and arguably as good a dancer as Kelly .
After first playing a bit of introductory piano , he dances and otherwise meanders his way through this number aided by a series of props , including a dummy .
`` Make 'Em Laugh '' was written for the 1952 musical by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed , but any similarity with the Cole Porter track `` Be A Clown '' is not coincidental .
Although Arthur Freed -LRB- 1894-1973 -RRB- was a lyricist , he was best known as a producer , and produced many , many musicals in the 1940s and 1950s .
By the time the film was ready for shooting , they had no song for O'Connor 's character to perform solo , so co-director Stanley Donen suggested that Brown and Freed write a new song , indicating it should be like `` Be A Clown '' .
The result was called 100 % plagiarism by Donen , but although Porter could have sued , he owed a personal debt to Freed for commissioning him to write the score for The Pirate after two of his musicals had flopped consecutively on Broadway .
