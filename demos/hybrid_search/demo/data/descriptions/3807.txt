Already proficient on several other musical instruments , Ellie Varner only took up the guitar at the age of 16 , and within a year she was writing such songs as `` So Fly . ''
However she nearly did n't pursue a career in music due to a lack of self-esteem .
This Pop & Oak produced song , where Varner tempts her guy with the promise of `` somethin' extracurricular on a lunch break , '' reveals a more confident performer .
`` I 've grown so much over the past few years from when I wrote ` So Fly ' , '' she told MTV News , `` feeling completely insecure and hopeless and like , ` I 'll never get a boyfriend , ' to feeling like the girl in ` Sound Proof Room ' ... confidently expressing myself and how I feel . ''
