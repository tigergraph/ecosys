Guitarist Zoltan Bathory commented to Metal Hammer : `` You could call this the equivalent of ` Meet The Monster ' from the first album -- a heavy , grinding , nasty riff , greasy and aggressive . ''
He added : `` In rehearsals , we were playing the song in a more measured way , but that gave it too much of a ` doomy ' quality , which we did n't really want .
However , the moment we speeded it up a bit , everything fell into place .
The only trouble was , the breakdown section in the middle already featured a double-time riff , so once we decided to quicken the pace , it made that section even harder to play !
I think it 's the ugliest breakdown I 've ever heard ! ''
Bathory joked to Kerrang !
: `` I think that more than anything this song taught us that before we write and record in future we need to hook Ivan -LSB- Moody , vocals -RSB- ' up with a really dysfunctional chick , because it seems to bring the best out of him on almost every level . ''
