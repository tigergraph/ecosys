This is the first single from 2008 American Idol runner-up David Archuleta 's sophomore studio album .
The song , which was co-written by Archuleta , finds him singing about the ups and downs of being in love .
He told On The Red Carpet during the 2010 Capitol Fourth celebration in Washington DC .
`` It 's a more uptempo song for the summer .
Just very radio friendly .
Even though there are the hard times , and the difficult challenges , there 's still something about love that 's worth it . ''
