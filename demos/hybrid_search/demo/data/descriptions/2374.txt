The title track of former Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Scherzinger 's debut solo album finds her equating love to physical pain .
She explained to AOL Music why she named the disc after this song : `` I came up with the title of the album 'cause at the time , there -LSB- were -RSB- only a few songs that I had written , to be honest with you - and ` Killer Love ' was one of them .
I wrote ` Killer Love ' about a tortured love .
Where you ca n't get enough of the love but it 's not good for you .
And I guess when the fans listen to the album , I want them to know that a lot of the music that I chose had to do with my past experiences and relationships , where I 've lost myself many times .
It 's -LSB- about -RSB- being lost and broken and in a very fearful , dark place and the process -LSB- of -RSB- coming out of that .
It 's a very empowering album but it comes from a place of heartbreak . ''
