This party anthem samples UK rock band Supergrass 's `` Alright , '' which was a # 2 hit in their home country in 1995 .
Ironically , Supergrass split up in the week of the release of Lazarus .
They played their final gig in Paris on June 11 , 2010 .
McCoy told Alternative Press : '' ` We 'll Be Alright ' is a fun song about not giving a f -- k and not caring about what people think ; just ignoring your insecurities .
There 's a song by Michael Jackson called ` Off The Wall ' and in it he says , ` So tonight got ta leave that 9-to-5 upon the shelf and just enjoy yourself . '
That line definitely inspired ` We 'll Be Alright . '
We can beat ourselves up about flaws we have , but at the end of the night , if we embrace them and realize we ca n't change those things , then we 'll be alright .
To me , this is a party anthem .
I took a lot of time with the tracklisting of the album , making sure that it was cohesive and it was like a ride .
Putting this after ` Akidagain ' was really important . ''
