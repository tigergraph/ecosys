Clutch frontman Neil Fallon wrote this ribbing of Rap-Rock without ever intending it to end up on Pure Rock Fury .
Released as a single , it became the band 's most commercially successful song to date peaking at # 24 on Billboard 's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks .
Speaking to us in a 2013 interview , Fallon said : `` I never thought in a million years that song was going to end up on a record .
Other people liked it , and I actually was kind of dragging my feet , and said , ` No , because people are going to read this the wrong way , saying that you 're trying to do rap rock , ' where I was just kind of taking the piss .
That was done for fun . ''
