Dallas Green explained the lyric , `` Why are we so worried .
More about the hurry and less about the harm , '' to Kerrang !
: `` We can all agree that we live very fast-paced lives , '' he said .
`` I think we worry more about the ` hurry ' than just about the consequences or ` the harm . '
I 'm just as guilty as everyone else .
I wrote this as a way to remind myself to slow down and appreciate what 's in front of me . ''
