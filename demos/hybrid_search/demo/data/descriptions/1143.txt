This is the title track from American indie rock band The Gaslight 's second studio album .
Prior to the release of the LP , it was released as a 7 '' vinyl single and a year later it was given a full single release .
The online music store eMusic named The '59 Sound their best album of 2008 .
The line `` I hope we do n't hear Marley 's Chains we forged in life '' is a reference to the ghost of Jacob Marley from Dickens ' A Christmas Carol .
This is one of many quotes and references from novels , films and songs on The '59 Sound .
Singer guitarist Brian Fallon explained to Jam !
Music : `` I look at our music as a soundtrack and I look at the lyrics like a movie script .
And I try and write them so that people are watching the images go by in their head as they 're hearing the lyrics .
And when I reference another song it 's because it 's playing during a scene in that movie .
At least , that 's how I see it in my head . ''
The ` sound ' of the title refers not only to vintage rock , but also to Fallon 's self-built 1959 Fender Bassman amp .
