The Defamation of Strickland Banks is a concept album by English Hip-Hop/Soul artist Ben Drew , aka Plan B , about a British soul singer who finds fame with bittersweet love songs , but then loses everything when he ends up in prison for a crime he did n't commit .
This is the closing track on the CD and it finds Strickland back in court as new evidence has been brought up on his case .
The record finishes with the listener not sure of whether he is sent back to prison or released .
Drew reveals more of the storyline on a companion album called The Ballad of Belmarsh , a hip-hop laden `` series of events '' that depicts the story of Banks .
Drew told Artist Direct that he always saw this track as the album closer .
He explained : `` As I was writing it , I did , which is why I try to namedrop every song on the album in ` What You Gon na Do . '
When I heard the music , it just felt like the end song -- whether it be the penultimate or the very end .
I say , ` Just do n't leave me on a cliffhanger , ' and it became evident that it had to be the last song .
On the hip hop record , you find out in greater details what happened in the Strickland Banks story .
I knew that record was coming so I did n't want to disclose that information on The Defamation of Strickland Banks .
That 's why I left this album on a cliffhanger . ''
