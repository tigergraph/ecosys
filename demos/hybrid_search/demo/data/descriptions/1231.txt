`` Children of the Sea '' is perhaps the most distinctive song from the Black Sabbath album Heaven and Hell .
While the writing credits on the album are given to the entire crew of Ronnie James Dio , Tony Iommi , Bill Ward and Geezer Butler , the rest of the group already had the tune while Dio , brought in to replace Ozzy Osbourne , wrote the lyrics.In the book Precious Metal : Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces , Dio tells how this song became his welcome to the band : `` I met them at the house that they were using to rehearse in and purely went to say hello and get to know them .
I had no thoughts whatsoever of being in the band .
As far as I knew , Ozzy was still in the band .
During the conversation , Tony asked me if I 'd like to see the studio they were doing their things in .
He , Geezer and Bill picked up their instruments and started to play -LSB- what became -RSB- ` Children of the Sea ' and I liked it very much .
Tony asked me if I could do anything with it .
I said , ` Give me a few minutes , I think I can knock something out . '
We pretty well wrote the song that quickly .
`` Incidentally , in the aforementioned book it is revealed that this was almost the end of Black Sabbath !
The band had agreed that if any of the seminal members left , they would n't call whatever remained `` Black Sabbath '' any more .
What saved the name ?
They were contractually obligated to produce one more album with Vertigo / Warner Brothers !
No relation is evident between this song and the -LRB- beginning 2007 -RRB- manga series of the same title .
Tony Iommi wanted the song to evoke `` a giant ship rowed by galley slaves . ''
`` Children of the Sea '' is one of the most enigmatic Black Sabbath songs as far as lyrics go .
On the matter of Dio 's lyrics - a marked change from Ozzy 's - we have only some quotes from Precious Metal : Dio : `` I was never questioned about what I was going to write or what I did write .
I questioned it more than they .
`` Butler : `` He took -LSB- the lyrics -RSB- more in the fantasy theme .
It stayed on that same sort of mystical theme .
I always liked listening to Ronnie 's lyrics .
They were so different from what I could do .
`` Ward : `` For me , there were some lyrics that were absolutely brilliant , and there were some lyrics that , kind of like , ` Oh , I ca n't believe I 'm participating in that . '
`` By the way , Dio 's actual birth name is Ronald James Padavona , and he was born to an Italian family in Portsmouth , New Hampshire .
`` Dio '' is the Italian word for `` God . ''
Nevertheless , Dio has mentioned in interviews with HM Magazine that he was at odds with his Catholic upbringing , although he does n't give the idea of being `` anti-Christian '' much thought , either .
The song was originally recorded with an entirely different vocal melody and lyrics by original Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne prior to his ousting .
