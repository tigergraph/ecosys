Ocean sings on this jazz-inflected tune of the adverse effects of drugs , as he recounts the tale of a friend who gets hooked on crack and looses everything .
The New Orleans native goes on to criticize the government for ignoring the soaring rate of crack-related deaths .
`` Do n't no one hear the sound of another one hitting the ground , '' he croons .
The song samples the drum pattern from the Jimi Hendrix track , `` Little Miss Lover . ''
When he was young , Ocean would accompany his former drug addict grandfather to 12-step meetings , where he observed him acting as a mentor for other addicts .
`` It totally ingrained this fear of addiction and of anything that could cause me to be addicted , '' he told The New York Times .
Ocean sings this song with a hint of fractured breathiness , which his sound engineer tried to iron out .
`` He said , ` Are we really going to let this slide ?
, ' '' recalled Ocean to The Guardian .
`` And I was like , ` Yes , because that 's how a smoker would sing . ' ''
