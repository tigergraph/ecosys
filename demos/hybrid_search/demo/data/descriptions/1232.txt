A play on the phrase `` Porn Star , '' Nashville songwriters Jeffrey Steele and Shane Minor originally wrote this up-tempo cut , before playing Morgan a demo .
The singer told Billboard magazine that he , `` told them I loved it , but there were some things that were n't Craig Morgan that we 'd need to fix , and I asked if I could rewrite it . ''
They told him to go ahead so he , `` made some changes that made it personal , but it was their idea . ''
The song has inspired a T-shirt that has become one of the most popular items at Morgan 's shows .
`` Corn Star '' is a track from Morgan 's sixth studio album , This Ole Boy .
Co-produced with his longtime creative partner Phil O'Donnell , the album was released on the Black River Music Group label on February 20 , 2012 .
