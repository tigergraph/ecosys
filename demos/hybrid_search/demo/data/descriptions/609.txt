This is the lead single from Money & Celebrity , the third studio album by English alternative rock trio The Subways .
The song was inspired by a comment one of frontman Billy Lunn 's friends made during a night out .
Bassist Charlotte Cooper told NME : `` Billy wrote the song after he and his friends went out and one of them had just lost his job .
It got to midnight and they turned out their pockets and they had no cash left , and the one who had lost his job said to Billy , ` It 's OK , we do n't need money to have a good time . ' ''
