This is a track from New York based dance-punk outfit The Rapture 's fourth studio album In The Grace of Your Love .
The record was released on September 6 , 2011 following a five-year hiatus during which frontman Luke Jenner had the traumatic experience of dealing with his mother 's suicide .
He told Spin magazine this song was inspired by his loss : `` It 's dealing with the death of my mom .
I had songs pouring out of me at the time and it started off as an acoustic demo .
When your mom takes her own life , it 's a big blow .
You do n't have a choice whether you love your mom or not , no matter what that person does to you or anybody else .
That song is specifically dealing through that pain in some way . ''
