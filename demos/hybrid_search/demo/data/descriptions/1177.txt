This song is the second single from Country music artist Eric Church 's sophomore album , Carolina , which he describes as `` introspective . ''
He penned the song with Deric Ruttan and Jeremy Spillman .
This song is about a girl whom the male narrator knows and he warns his friend that she is `` heaven on the eyes / but boy , she 's hell on the heart . ''
Church told The Tennessean the lyrics are based on a true story .
He explained : `` I come from a small town , and in a small town the same four or five guys at some point in time will end up with the same four or five girls .
There was one girl , she burned through all of us . ''
