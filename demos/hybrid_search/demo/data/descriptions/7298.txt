This song is about a guy who is trying to get over a girl he liked .
It explains how he met her and how he 's struggling to let her go .
-LRB- thanks , Sandra - Miami , FL -RRB- There is controversy over whose girlfriend this is about , but the song is about the girlfriend 's death , not a breakup .
Her death and the boyfriend trying to get over her are indicated in the lyrics , `` Deep inside I wish it was me instead . ''
The song was written by Swedish producer Max Martin , and it 's unknown if it 's about Martin 's former love or a former girlfriend of one of the members of the group .
Most speculate Kevin Richardson , although it 's never been proven .
