Lambert co-wrote this song , which expands on her bad-girl streak -LRB- exhibit 1 `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend '' -RRB- with her boyfriend Blake Shelton .
She said : `` If Blake and I plan to co-write , it usually never works .
We wind up getting bored or deciding to go drive back roads instead .
But if we just happen upon it , something great comes out of it .
This was late at night , and it was so cool because Blake put himself in a 25-year-old girl 's place and wrote from my perspective .
It 's basically about cheating , love gone bad , and the death of something , whether it 's love or a person -- however you want to interpret it .
My mom always says , never return evil for evil .
So I kind of put that into my own words and wrote ' A Sin for a Sin . '
Because drinking and digging a hole in return for cheating does n't solve anything -- but people do it !
To me that 's the song on my record that sounds most like ` Kerosene ' and ` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend . '
It 's me in a nutshell .
If people have never heard my music before , there 's kind of a little theme going there .
Nobody really gets to live out all their fantasies .
I just get to sing mine in songs . ''
