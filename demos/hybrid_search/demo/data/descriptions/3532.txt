Dave Matthews explained to Relix magazine : `` I wrote that song while I was sitting on a boat with my wife and kids and some friends , writing the lyrics on my iPhone while we went across this lake .
It 's a nice goodbye for the record .
Because there 's been a lot of dark stuff , I thought that , at the end , it deserved a really straightforward song about hope . ''
The Dave Matthews Band performed the song live at the 2010 Grammy Awards .
The resulting online sales enabled the song to debut at # 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 .
