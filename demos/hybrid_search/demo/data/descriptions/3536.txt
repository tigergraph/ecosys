This dramatic track came about after guitarist Felix White and drummer Sam Doyle set themselves the task of writing a song in one day .
White told NME : `` We had Philly cheesesteak sandwiches , then we wrote this song and called it ` Philly Cheesesteak . '
We were trying to make it sound like LCD Soundsystem . ''
The song features the soaring vocals of Catherine Pockson who is one half the South London ambient pop duo , Alpines .
