This bittersweet ballad is a track from Country music group Lady Antebellum 's third studio album Own The Night .
The Lady A trio wrote it along with Josh Kear .
The Nashville songwriter 's other credits include Carrie Underwood 's country # 1 `` Before He Cheats '' and Lady A 's own smash hit `` Need You Now . ''
Lady Antebellum 's Hillary Scott explained the song 's meaning to The Boot : `` This song is about looking back on a really special night that you shared with someone , but I also think there 's a timelessness about it .
No matter how long it 's been or what the other person is doing now , you will always imagine them to be '18 and beautiful and dancin ' away with my heart ' ... that mental picture never changes because that night was magical .
I love how romantic that is ! ''
