The second single from Kutless ' seventh full length studio album , Believer , carries the message that even when hurt and heartache persist , we must trust that God ultimately is in control and is creating what will some day be a glorious ending .
`` From a spiritual perspective , ` Even If ' is probably the most difficult and challenging song on our new record , '' explained frontman Jon Micah Sumrall .
`` It directly addresses the question of ` what do we do when the answer to our prayers is no ? '
I have grown to realize that while we often pray for temporary or immediate comfort , God is doing a work on an eternal scale that far exceeds anything we could have ever imagined .
He never promises that life will be easy , only that He will be faithful to never leave us or forsake us , and He promises that the end of the story will be glorious . ''
