What started as use of a couple of Nero tracks as sound beds for The Great Gatsby movie evolved into a larger collaboration with its director , Baz Luhrmann , including this song and additional scoring work throughout the film .
Nero 's Dan Stephens told Billboard magazine : `` We heard last summer that two of our tracks from ` Welcome Reality ' were being used as temporary sound beds in the film .
A little after that , Baz came to our studio in L.A. and we talked about writing original music for those parts of the movie .
As fans of both the book and his work , we were pretty excited to get working on it . ''
`` We worked closely with Baz to write two pieces for the movie using some elements and themes from Craig Armstrong 's score , '' he continued .
`` We also added some of the electronic sounds we 'd used to other cues in the film to give some continuity to the overall score .
One of the cues we 'd written then developed into a full original song -LSB- ` Into the Past ' -RSB- , with vocals from Alana -LSB- Watson -RSB- .
It 's based around one of the central themes of the story , that of memory and Gatsby 's drive to reshape past events . ''
