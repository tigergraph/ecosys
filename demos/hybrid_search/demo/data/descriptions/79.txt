Satriani originally started writing this tune when he was in high school .
He explained to Billboard magazine : `` I tried it on a few records but it never took off .
This time around , everything was working really well ... I was able to really bring the songs to the band and say , ` Let 's try this . '
It 's just two chords and a bunch of guitar harmonies , very laid back , and this time I had a band that understood it and could really do it . ''
