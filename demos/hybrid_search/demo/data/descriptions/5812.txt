Jessie Ware wrote this light-hearted upbeat song about dancing with Bristol house producer Julio Bashmore .
She told The Guardian that initially things were awkward .
`` Writing a Pop song was a new thing for both of us , and I started to feel really self-conscious and out of my depth , '' she admitted .
To break the tension , Ware and Bashmore started flicking through a Hip-Hop magazine .
Their attention was caught by a striking image of the large Puerto-Rican/American rapper Big Pun sitting on a throne .
`` I decided , ` Right , I 'm going to write a song about a girl trying to get him off his throne and dance ' , '' she said .
The song 's music video was directed by Kate Moross and filmed at Painshill Park , an 18th-century English landscape park located at Cobham , Surrey .
The ethereal love song was re-titled `` If You 're Never Gon na Move '' for its American release .
This was due to sample clearance issues with the estate of Big Pun .
`` We had to be imaginative and change the words .
It 's annoying but it always happens , '' Ware told Billboard magazine .
Repeated throughout the song there is a sample of Big Pun reciting the line , `` carving my initials on your forehead '' from his track , `` The Dream Shatterer . ''
`` There was something quite obscene about that line that I kind of wanted to see if I could get away sampling one of the biggest , most beloved rappers on top of this very sweet vocal , '' Ware recalled to Billboard magazine with a laugh .
`` It just cuts through and sounds really good with the song . ''
The `` 110 % '' song title is a playful reference to Big Pun 's song `` 100 % '' Ware told MTV News that it was `` odd '' that the song had to be retitled and reworked after she could n't clear the Big Pun sample .
`` I basically wrote the song based on the idea of trying to get -LSB- Big Pun -RSB- out of his chair , '' she said , `` and onto the dancefloor ... you know , this massive kind of guy who just wo n't budge , even though you really want him to . ''
