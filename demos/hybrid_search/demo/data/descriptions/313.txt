Chicago 's bass player Peter Cetera wrote this and sang lead .
After it became a huge hit , the band became known for its ballads that featured Cetera 's vocals and de-emphasized the horn section .
In the UK , this was Chicago 's only # 1 hit .
This won a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Performance By a Duo , Group or Chorus and received Record of the Year .
This was the first Chicago single to feature an acoustic guitar lead .
It was also their first # 1 hit .
