This cut features vocals by Erykah Badu .
Flying Lotus , aka Steve Ellison , originally met the neo soul songstress through his bassist Thundercat , who has played in her backing band and collaborated with her on his The Golden Age of Apocalypse album .
Ellison first worked with Badu when he directed her `` Gone Baby Gone '' video .
He told Consequence of Sound : `` Erykah Badu , she 's the real deal , man .
There are a lot of artists that I wish were the real deal , but she truly nails it every take .
You do n't have to work hard to make her sound good .
She just hits it right out the gate . ''
