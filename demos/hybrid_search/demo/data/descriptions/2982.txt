This is the first single from British indie-rock band British Sea Power 's fourth non-soundtrack studio album , Valhalla Dancehall .
The album was co-produced by BSP and Graham Sutton , whom the band worked with on their previous releases .
The song 's music video was directed by Luke Seomore and Joseph Bull , and was shot on London 's Brick Lane .
It was inspired by iconic French director Henri-Georges Clouzot 's unfinished 1964 film L'Enfer .
In Viking mythology , Valhalla was an enormous hall ruled over by the god Odin .
The Scandinavian warriors saw it a form of Heaven where many of those that die in combat travelled to upon death , led by valkyries .
In Valhalla the Vikings believed they would fight there all day , then at night those who were slain on the battlefield would be raised and the wounded made whole again .
They would spend the evening in banquets , drinking wine from cups made from the skulls of their conquered foes .
BSP chose the title to reflect the fact that the album contains the widest collection of songs they 've done to date .
`` The title evolved as a place to house what we 'd done , '' explained vocalist Yan to Clash Magazine . ''
` Valhalla Dancehall ' is this fictitious , imaginary place that we had to make up as a place that could house all these songs .
Imagine all these different rooms and different things going on in them all at the same time .
We 're in the same house , but different rooms .
So with the songs , we had a certain structure to fit into this word and atmosphere , but there was n't really any limit to what could come out or what was possible . ''
