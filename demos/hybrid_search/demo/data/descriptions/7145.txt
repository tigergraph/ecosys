This song is a call to arms to unshackle ourselves from laptop culture .
Vocalist Brian Briggs told the NME that he does n't believe there 's anything wrong with the internet as such .
He explained : `` I believe that the extent to which our society , both work and home , tends to be indoors has meant that people have very much lost touch with the outdoors and actually suffer as a consequence . ''
