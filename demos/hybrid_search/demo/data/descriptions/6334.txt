Waits liked to snatch stories from the street .
Like the time he and this then girlfriend , Rickie Lee Jones , were flagged down by a group of Mexican gang members .
`` Because of how Tom looked at the time - the tattoos , the hat - I guess these guys felt safe to talk to him , '' recalled Jones to the July 2011 edition of Mojo magazine .
`` one of them asked him where the hospital was .
He glanced into the back seat , and there was a kid back there bleeding .
A lot of blood .
He wrote ` Romeo Is Bleeding ' soon after . ''
The album cover features Waits ' then girlfriend Rickie Lee Jones .
-LRB- thanks , John - Los Angeles , CA , for above 2 -RRB- This is the song that provided the title for the Gary Oldman movie about a crooked cop .
