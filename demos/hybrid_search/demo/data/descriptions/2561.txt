In the lyrics , Michael seems to be addressing a new lover , who he refers to as `` teacher '' -LRB- possibly because he feels he has a lot to learn about love -RRB- .
It seems that he is reluctant to enter into this new love because of past experiences , and that he has been burned and is very bitter to the idea of another relationship .
