Aldean told AOL that this song has a number of different meanings .
He explained : `` One of them is that if there 's something you want to do , you do n't have to sell out to get it done .
Also for me , it 's the recording process .
The first two records have been a learning experience for me , and on this third album I 'm more comfortable now .
When I recorded the first album , I was a singer .
Now that I 'm going into this third album , I feel more like an artist .
I have my own style , my own way of doing things .
On this third album , we hit our stride , we blew the doors off , spreading out wings .
We 're wide open now ; we 're at full speed . ''
