The second single from American post hardcore band Madina Lake 's third album World War III was produced by Billy Corgan .
Frontman Nathan Leone told Rock Sound magazine about the collaboration with the Smashing Pumpkins frontman : `` Getting to work with Billy Corgan was f -- ing ridiculous .
He 's the most talented genius we 've ever had the privilege of meeting , much less working with .
He invited Matthew -LRB- Leone , bass -RRB- and I out to Sedona , AZ where they were working on the new Pumpkins record .
Coincidentally we were planning on going to Sedona so Matthew could rest and heal because it 's a very spiritual and energetic place .
So we flew out and stayed in one of the cabins they had rented .
It turned out that it was just Billy , his engineer and assistant .
We sat next to them as he went through countless song ideas each day and every time he played this one riff Matthew and I could n't contain our fanboy enthusiasm for it .
After three days he just turned around and asked us if we wanted it.That night at the cabin I essentially finished the lyrics and we brought it back to Madina , added guitars drums and bass in two days .
The record had taken on a few themes at this point , one being human nature and/or animal instinct because at this point we 'd essentially been surviving off it .
It 's about life breaking you down to your absolute core and finding beauty and peace in that . ''
