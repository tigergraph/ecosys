This drinking song was released as the fourth single by Outasight -LRB- aka Richard Andrew -RRB- , from his debut album Nights Like These .
The song 's music video sees Andrew getting on with life in a wintry , blue-collar area of New York .
`` The shots and wardrobe are gritty , representing the working man and woman who make this city great , '' Andrew told Billboard magazine .
`` New York is an amazingly diverse and resilient place , so we wanted to represent that as make my return after traveling far and wide working towards my dream .
They say home is where is the heart is , so no matter how far I 've gone , there 's only one place I go back to .
That 's all I 'm trying to do , find home and find peace . ''
