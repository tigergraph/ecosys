`` Change '' features a spoken-word performance from lead vocalist James Allan 's mother .
She takes the role of a woman driving to collect her son from prison on his release day , with the part of the apprehensive son sung by James .
The singer 's mum was nervous about her performance , but it was James who found himself out of his depth during the sunrise recording in her Glasgow high-rise flat .
`` I thought we were just gon na play the characters , and that 'd be it , and it would be fine , `` he explained to NME .
`` Part of the thing that I 'm saying to her is that I do n't know if I can change , but I 'll try and change for you .
But I guess there 's a lot of things I 'm not that proud of in my own life .
So when I was saying , ` I 'm gon na change for you ' I was n't talking about prison , I was talking about that other stuff .
And I did n't see that coming ... That 's the hardest song on the record , I think , for me . ''
The song features a sample of Maria Callas singing `` Castra Diva , '' which is an aria from Vincenzo Bellini 's opera , Norma , that speaks of a fierce maternal love .
Allan recalled to the Sunday Mail that despite her nerves , his mum could n't help mothering those around her : `` She was quite bossy and was telling Flood how to produce .
` Son , you 're no ' doing that right ' she was saying to him .
And she 'd tell me to swap lyrics around , saying : ` That bit does n't fit with that bit , James . ' ''
