This fades into `` You 'll Never Walk Alone , '' which is a song from Carousel , a musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein .
However , the song appears to have been recorded at a soccer match , hence the cheers and chanting at the end .
This is because Liverpool fans use this as their fight song .
It appears that at the end , the multitude is chanting `` Liverpool . ''
