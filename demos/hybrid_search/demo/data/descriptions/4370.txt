Scotty McCreery is a committed Christian who has been open in telling others how much his faith means to him .
On Sundays when he 's in his hometown of Garner , he attends the First Baptist Church there .
It 's no surprise , therefore , that he closes his debut album with a song that speaks of his beliefs and in particular his love for the Bible .
He said : `` It 's cool for me because it reminds me of my both of my granddaddys .
They both fought in the war .
It talks about a Bible being passed down from generations upon generations , from the granddaddy to the mom and then the mom to the kids .
It means a lot to me .
It reminded me of my family and how I grew up in church and reading the old King James Bible .
It speaks wonders about what that book can do for somebody and how important it is to pass it down from generation to generation . ''
Scotty and his team were looking to put a hymn or gospel song at the end of the album that would also fit the mold of the record .
The first time Scotty heard this was in Houston when he was chilling out in his dressing room and immediately fell in love with it and knew he 'd found the album closer .
Scotty stated this Phillip White and Mark Nesler penned song , `` passed the mama crying test , '' which involved him road testing various songs on his mom .
If a particular one reduced her to tears he 'd tell his record company , `` It passed the mama crying test , so it must be a good one . ''
