This is about what drugs do to you and how you perceive them .
This song is about someone who has had a drug or drinking problem and went through the steps to get rid of it .
Once free of the addiction this person denies he ever even had a problem .
The song is a wake-up call to people like that , reminding them that they did have a problem and they should n't just erase it from their memory .
All of the songs on the album correspond , though sometimes loosely , with one of the steps in the 12 Step Program .
The 8th step is `` Try to make a concerted effort to reach out to those you have harmed . ''
Making amends .
-LRB- thanks , Sydney - Lewiston , ME -RRB- Maynard Keenan got the idea for the song from a friend who said something along the lines of `` Do n't let your halo choke you . ''
After hearing that , Maynard ran to Billy Howerdel and told him he had an idea for a song .
-LRB- thanks , Jon - merrimack , NH , for above 2 -RRB-
