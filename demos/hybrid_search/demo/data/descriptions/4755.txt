This is the first single from Hawaiian singer-songwriter Jack Johnson 's fifth studio album , To The Sea .
Johnson directed the song 's music video , which features the singer surfing and floating in the ocean as waves swoop around him .
`` I was looking at the camera singing and I ca n't figure out when the wave 's going to hit me from behind , '' he told Billboard magazine .
`` That was fun to do .
It was a physical challenge . ''
Johnson told MTV News : '' -LSB- That song -RSB- started off with this guitar riff that I had around for a while , actually had it on the last record , and we liked it , but we did n't have any words for it yet , nothing came natural , so I did n't use it .
And at some point , some of the books I was reading started leading me in a certain direction , kind of like this broken king character .
That area you get in sometimes , where you stop trusting your heart and you start thinking too much about logic and this and that .
So it 's basically about that separation that can happen between the self and the heart and trying to trust your heart again . ''
