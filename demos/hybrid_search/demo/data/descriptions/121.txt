This song is talking about how small the `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' is .
Men are programmed to have certain views on women .
Whether it 's finding a dirty magazine on the playground as a kid , or Paris Hilton trying to sell you a sex-burger during a Teletubbies commercial .
No matter where you look , obscenity is `` In Your Eye . ''
It 's unavoidable and in your face , just like the guitar and vocal styles when they scream , `` Banana banana terra cotta ... '' The food references are symbolizing genitals -LRB- Banana = penis , pie = vagina -RRB- .
