Bundy wrote this with the Nashville songwriters Nathan Chapman , Andrew Dorff for her second album , which is divided into the `` Achin ' '' side and the `` Shakin ' '' side , representing two aspects of her personality .
`` Curse the Bed '' appears on the `` Achin ' '' side , and in our interview with Laura Bell Bundy , she said of the song : `` There 's two meanings for me .
It 's the ending of a relationship , and what that bed signifies for me personally , but it reminds me of my parents and when they divorced more than it reminds me of my life .
So when I sing it I 'm almost thinking of them . ''
Regarding the lyrics , `` I took a shower , put on a long white dress , and then danced for hours around the flames , '' Bundy told us : `` You wear white when you 're cleansed again .
It also represents what you wear when you get married , and what you wear when you 're baptized -- you wear white .
And what you wear at your first communion .
I was raised Catholic , so it 's like there 's something pure and really cleansing about wearing white that I feel like , I 'm gon na wear a flowy white long dress .
There was something pure about it .
Now , I 'm gon na take a shower , I 'm gon na get rid of this , and I 'm new again .
And I 'm gon na dance around these flames that are burning up high .
I 'm okay .
But I curse this . ''
