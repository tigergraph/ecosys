In an on-line response to a Wishbone Ash fan in October 2008 , bass player and vocalist Martin Turner said of this uptempo track , it was : `` Very much a band thing , I remember kickin this around on numerous jam sessions , I put the lyric together and the whole song came about by us reacting to the seriousness -LRB- for want of a better description -RRB- of the Argus album and wanting to move in a more straight ahead rock direction .
The lyric does speak of the fairly crazy Rock 'n' Roll existence we were living as seen through my eyes .
`` Although written very early in their career , this song does indeed sum up the rock 'n' roll life style ; probably the nearest thing to it is the downtempo Ian Hunter composition `` Ballad Of Mott '' .
