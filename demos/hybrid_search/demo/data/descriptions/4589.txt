Here 's what Clare had to say about this piano-led tune : `` It feels negative - but it is n't .
It 's about meeting a girl and having this amazing bond .
You want to chill out and not make bad things happen .
But then they do happen ... '' Alex Clare is now married to the person this song addresses .
He told MTV News in late 2012 : `` I wrote the song initially just after meeting them and then I sent it to them and was like , ` Hey , I just wrote this song .
What do you think ? '
And she seemed to get the message .
Fast-forward to a bit later and we 're married , which is cool . ''
