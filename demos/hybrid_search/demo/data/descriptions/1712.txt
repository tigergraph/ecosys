Following the success of his role of a down-on-his-luck Country singer in Crazy Heart , actor Jeff Bridges signed with the Jazz music label Blue Note Records to record an album .
This tears-in-your-beer ballad was one of three songs written for the project by John Goodwin , who Bridges has known since the fourth grade .
They previously worked together on Bridges ' first record , Be Here Soon , which Bridges released in 2000 through Ramp Records , a label he created specifically for that project with Michael McDonald and friend Chris Polonis .
