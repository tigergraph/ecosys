Paul Weller explained to Mojo magazine June 2008 that this was inspired by the youngest of his five kids , Mac : `` I was on a beach in Spain , he was rushing towards the sea , with no sense of fear , with me calling to him and he could n't hear me .
All he could see was the sea in front of him and he was just going for it .
It just seemed like a brilliant metaphor for living your life . ''
