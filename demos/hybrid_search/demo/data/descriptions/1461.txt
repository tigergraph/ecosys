If there were ever any doubt as to whether lyrics or melody made a great song , `` Chloroform Girl '' must surely provide the definitive answer.True , this is a long way from a great song , but it does have an exceptionally beautiful melody - with harmonies thrown in .
Actually , the lyrics are n't that bad , and will probably go down well with non-English speakers , but women especially may not see the joke .
It remains to be seen what inspired it , hopefully a horror story with a happy ending .
`` Chloroform Girl '' is arguably the most profound case of lyrical dissonance since Frank Zappa penned `` Why Does It Hurt When I Pee ? ''
