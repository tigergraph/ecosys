When David Crosby 's girlfriend , Christine Hinton , died in a traffic accident in 1969 , the singer was devastated .
Crosby sought an outlet in work for his debut solo album and amongst the musicians he recruited from his circle of friends was The Grateful Dead 's Jerry Garcia , who contributed electric and pedal steel guitar .
Garcia proved to be a supportive figure to the singer after the tragedy .
Crosby told Uncut magazine : `` When I was making my solo record , I was in terrible shape because my girlfriend had just died .
I did n't know what to do .
I had no way to deal with it , so I hid in the studio -- it was the only place I felt comfortable .
Jerry came by every night .
Every night he 'd show , and we 'd tap away . ''
If I Could Only Remember My Name gained new recognition in 2010 when it was listed second on the Vatican 's `` Top 10 Pop Albums of All Time '' as published in the official newspaper of the Holy See , L'Osservatore Romano .
-LRB- The Beatles ' Revolver topped the list -RRB- .
This song features wordless scatting by Crosby .
He recalled to Uncut magazine : `` I had a double handful of songs , and were good .
I was doing things nobody had heard before , like ` Tamalpais High ' and ` Song With No Words , ' using your voice like a horns stack .
They were loving that we 'd do s -- t nobody else had done . ''
