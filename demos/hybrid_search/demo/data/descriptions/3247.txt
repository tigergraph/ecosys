This waking-from-a-nightmare album closer was one of several tracks on Nothing Personal that signaled a new found maturity and depth for pop punk band All Time Low : Frontman Alex Gaskarth told MTV News : `` It 's nice to get away from the pop-punk niche we came up in ... it 's nice to try to broaden your horizons .
To be honest , we wrote a lot of this album with that in mind It weighs on you when you see all these new bands start popping up and getting signed , because that 's the nature of this terrible industry we 're in .
So , we definitely noticed that , and we definitely thought , ` What can we do this time around that is n't going to piss off our fans too much , but is going to set us apart from all these little kids that have deals and songs on MTV now ? ' ''
Gaskarth told Teen.com TV that this is his favorite song on Nothing Personal , adding that it 's `` about every kid 's nightmare when people are telling you that you need to get help but all you really want is a hug . ''
