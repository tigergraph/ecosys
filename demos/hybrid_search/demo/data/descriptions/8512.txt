This song was written by Dave Grohl .
It is about Courtney Love and her possible role in Kurt 's death with the line `` I had no hand in your ever desperate plan . ''
He got them together and now regrets it , hence the line , `` I should have known , you were better off alone . ''
He also tells Courtney to leave him alone by saying `` I do n't owe you anything . ''
-LRB- thanks , Roland - St. Louis , MO -RRB- This is the second track off the foos debut album .
-LRB- thanks , Luke - Leeds , England , for above 2 -RRB- When Grohl says `` I do n't owe you anything '' he means that he will never trust Courtney Love ever again , because of her theoretical part in Cobain 's death .
The video was directed by Jerry Casale , a founding member of Devo .
Casale directed Devo 's videos , and Grohl contacted him because he wanted it to look like a Devo video without ripping them off .
