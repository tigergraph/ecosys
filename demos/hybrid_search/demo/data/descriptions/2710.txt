The solo debut of former Girls ' frontman Christopher Owens tells the story of his falling in love with Lysandre , a woman that he met at a festival during the band 's first tour .
They eventually broke up , and Owens dealt with his pain by writing this concept disc .
Structured in chronological order , each song tells of a different aspect of their relationship as well as other things going on in his life at the time .
This song tells of Owens courting of Lysandre .
He explained : `` Lysandre was a girl working at the festival .
After the festival ended there was a party for bands and crew , we all sat around drinking wine and talking , I finally asked her to sit with me - ` Just when I thought it was over I said come sit on my lap , you did and you asked me why I had n't tried to kiss you yet .
And I said that I wanted to yesterday when you took me to your mother 's house and we watched television on the couch , and then I bought a pack of cigarettes . '
At the end of that song I talk about remembering how I felt when the flight I was on had to have an emergency landing because the airplane blew a tire on take-off . ''
