This song appeared on the VH1 program James Taylor-Storytellers 2 in 1997 .
Taylor explained that he was very young when he wrote this song and had no idea that even songs like `` Fire And Rain '' would have a life on the marketplace , therefore songwriting was just a hobby for him at that point .
What inspired him to write `` Mud Slide Slim '' was a picture that was sent to him of a charred tree that had been washed down a hill in a mudslide .
And someone had nailed a sign to this tree saying `` I 've seen fire and I 've seen rain . ''
While it was a funny moment for James , it also inspired him to write a song .
