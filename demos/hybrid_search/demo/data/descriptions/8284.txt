`` When I 'm Gone '' does not necessarily mean `` when I 'm gone in a permanent sense . ''
When Brad Arnold wrote this song , the subject he had in mind was unconditional love , for when you 're removed from your loved one by miles , or time , or other obstacles .
`` It 's asking a question , just please love me when I 'm gone , '' says the lead singer .
`` And not just like when I 'm dead and gone , but when I 'm gon na come back .
And that 's kind of one thing it 's about .
But at the same time it 's kind of about unconditional love .
It 's a lot of different statements it 's asking of the person in that song .
And it 's like just the fulfillment of those different needs for every situation that it mentions .
So I guess that song is just about needing someone really to be there for you unconditionally , and when you 're gone . ''
Although the lyrics do n't have anything to do with the army or war , the music video was dedicated to all the men and women serving in the United States military .
An `` education x-ray , '' explains Brad , would refer to a psychologist or therapist who does n't actually take an x-ray of you with a machine , but rather forms a sort of mental x-ray of you by way of their educational training , and the time spent talking with you to make a diagnosis .
In Brad 's words : `` It 's when a kid 's mom or dad is quick to take them to a psychologist or something , and it 's like talking about their education x-ray trying to look into you .
It 's like , ` I 'm not gon na tell you a damn thing that I could n't tell my friends . ' ''
-LRB- Check out our full interview with Brad Arnold -RRB- This song gained popularity around the time the US was preparing to invade Iraq .
For many people in the military , it said a lot about how they were feeling being away from their families and loved ones , and reminded them that everyone back home was still thinking of them .
