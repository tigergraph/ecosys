This song is a criticism at the idea of war for entertainment purposes .
At the same time there is a note of optimism that maybe the tide is turning , giving a glimmer of hope in this unpromising world .
The album Radio KAOS tells the story of a disabled boy who can receive radio waves in his head .
Waters uses the narrative to attack Reagan , Thatcher , monetarism and nuclear war .
Waters performed this as the closing number at his July 21 , 1990 `` The Wall Live in Berlin '' concert at the site of the Berlin Wall .
The cold war was over , and he was optimistic , full of hope .
Among the all star cast on the live version were Joni Mitchell , Cyndi Lauper , Bryan Adams , Van Morrison and Paul Carrack .
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England , for all above -RRB- There was supposed to be another verse to this song , but it was removed because Waters was worried about lawsuits .
He did , however , sing the last 2 lines of it during some live concerts .
He sang : `` Now the past is over but you are not alone , together we 'll fight Sylvester Stallone , we will not be dragged down in his South China Sea of macho bulls -- t and mediocrity . ''
Earlier in the song Waters had also referred to Stallone when he sung `` The tide is turning , Sylvester . ''
His criticism of Sylvester Stallone was because at the time , the actor was renowned for his super-patriot , anti-communist film roles such as Rambo , and Waters disliked the way Stallone 's movies glorified violence .
This was the concluding song on the album .
Waters added it when his record company told him that the album was too downbeat .
