This tells the story of Rael , a poor Puerto Rican boy from The Bronx .
As `` The Lamb , '' Rael goes on an adventure in New York City .
The full story is in the liner notes of the album .
There are references to classic songs throughout the album , and this track recalls `` On Broadway , '' which was a hit for The Drifters in 1963 .
This was the first song and title track to the double album which was the last Peter Gabriel contribution to Genesis .
This was the basis for an elaborate stage production Genesis performed at concerts .
It was on this tour that Gabriel decided to leave the band .
On their 1974 tour , they played the album from start to finish .
Gabriel wore several costumes throughout the show .
The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway was a song-cycle whose hero Rael shared a name with `` Rael -LRB- 1 and 2 -RRB- , '' a track on The Who 's 1967 album , The Who Sell Out .
Mojo April 2010 asked Peter Gabriel if it was a conscious tribute to The Who 's Pete Townshend .
He replied : `` It was a subconscious tribute because I certainly was n't aware of it at the time .
I spent a long time thinking of that name , like Ra the Sun God .
But I was a big Who fan , so it may have got in there .
Obviously Townshend created much of the musical environment and delivered the angst with an intelligence and passion and extraordinary musicality .
But to this day , as a drummer , I think Keith Moon was the unacknowledged genius .
He was like Jimi Hendrix : when he was on - and he was n't always - it flowed out of him in a free way that was inspiring , driving , magnificent . ''
