Tired Pony is a music supergroup formed by Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody out of his love for Country music .
The band consists of R.E.M. 's Peter Buck on guitar , Belle And Sebastian drummer Richard Colburn , Troy Stewart , a regular touring member of Snow Patrol , Iain Archer , a long-time Snow Patrol collaborator ; producer Garret `` Jacknife '' Lee -LRB- U2 , Bloc Party -RRB- and Scott McCaughey , R.E.M. 's full-time auxiliary member since 1994 .
This song sets the action of the record inside a `` crumble down cinema '' as a pair of young lovers shelter from a cyclone .
`` We can hide where we always hide , '' Lightbody sings , `` on the blank screen project our lives .
`` The young lovers later return later on the record in the seven minute ballad `` Held In The Arms of Your Words . ''
Lightbody explained to Uncut magazine August 2010 that The Place We Run From `` was inspired by a renewed love of Country music over the last few years .
New Country and me have been pals for a long time .
This was Old Country - Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers and Waylon Jennings ; all these records that I grew up with , but which I kept at arm 's length .
The concept of Tired Pony was of a worn-out cowboy .
But when we got into the studio , I did n't tell them I wanted to make a Country record .
We just made the record that we were supposed to make . ''
