Thousand Foot Krutch vocalist Trevor McNevan told NewReleaseTuesday he is utilizing the slang version of `` wicked '' in this song rather than its original malevolent meaning .
He explained : `` I know what you 're thinking ... the word ` Wicked ' can be associated with a million negative things , but for me , as a Canadian , it has always been a word associated with something great - no different than the word ` awesome ' or ` going to the fence , ' ` giving it all you got ' so to speak . ''
Lyrically this song is about the tendency for some Christians to be `` too nice '' and get treated like doormats .
McNevan told NewReleaseTuesday : `` I was inspired to write this based on the saying , ` Do n't mistake kindness for weakness . '
I heard that once , and it 's always resonated with me .
I think as Christians , we can tend to be too nice , and let people walk all over us .
This is n't a song promoting violence or anything of that nature , it 's more of a statement , saying , ` my faith 's my life , but that does n't mean you can walk all over me . ' ''
