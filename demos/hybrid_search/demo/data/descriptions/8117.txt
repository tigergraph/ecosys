As told by lead singer Chad Urmston on the State Radio website : `` Bostonia is sort of about this bunch of kids in Boston who are trying to keep the school , the fall from coming .
Basically they 're fighting as knights that they believe themselves to be and they 're trying to keep the summer alive as they days are getting colder in Boston . ''
