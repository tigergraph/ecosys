Speaking to Rock Sound magazine , frontman Nathan Leone explained how the song 's lyrical content was inspired by his love life .
He said : `` We 'd been heading in several different directions sonically and Mateo -LSB- Camargo , guitar -RSB- had a bunch of almost clubby , hip-hop beats and loops we were working on .
I met this gorgeous girl around that time that had a relentless sex appeal .
She definitely inspired it lyrically , plus I 'm engaged to her now so that worked out ha . ''
