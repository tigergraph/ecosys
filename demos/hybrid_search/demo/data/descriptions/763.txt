Running to 5 minutes 14 seconds , `` Postcards From Richard Nixon '' is the opening track on The Captain & the Kid .
Like all the tracks thereon , it was co-written by Elton and his original lyricist Bernie Taupin .
The two men were interviewed at length in a video to promote the concept album , wherein Bernie said it kicks off with Elton 's ascension , which he identified as Los Angeles , 1970 .
The man himself confirmed this , adding that this was where they 'd always wanted to be , a sentiment that has been shared by most British artistes down the years if only in view of the potential of the enormous American market .
Written in 4/4 time , `` Postcards From Richard Nixon '' is similar in content to the Al Stewart song `` A Child 's View Of The Eisenhower Years '' fifteen years down the line , but while a California-based Al was writing about his boyhood vision of American society , Bernie Taupin was looking back three decades and more .
Richard Millhouse Nixon -LRB- 1913-94 -RRB- was the 37th President of the United States .
Although he left office in disgrace following the Watergate scandal , future historians will unquestionably judge him more kindly than his contemporaries , especially in view of America 's disastrous foreign policy in the wake of September 11 .
Having said all that , this is not really a song about Richard Nixon , tribute or otherwise , but about two young Englishmen on the cusp of super-stardom and their vision of the Promised Land .
The song ends with Nixon 's resignation , `` I 've got ta go but you can stay '' .
Although it is most unlikely the President of the United States would have sent a postcard to a then relatively obscure singer-songwriter from across the Pond , stranger things have happened since .
Tweenty-seven years later , Elton would perform at the funeral of a personal friend who was not a president but an even more exotic creature , a princess .
