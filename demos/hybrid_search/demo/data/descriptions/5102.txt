This early - '90s Grunge classic has some intriguing lyrics : `` Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to healTake time with a wounded hand 'cause I like to steal .
`` The `` Wounded Hand '' could belong to Jesus Christ , simply because Jesus was a healer and of course he had nails driven through his hands .
Also , you could say that in the song he wants to be healed of any tragic flaws , indicated by the line '' 'cause I like to steal . ''
