`` The Crooked Beat '' is often viewed as bassist Paul Simonon 's followup to his popular song on the London Calling album , `` The Guns Of Brixton . ''
The songs share a South London location in the lyrics and also Simonon 's monotone vocals .
Both songs were written fully by him .
The lyrics are inspired by the popular nursery rhyme `` There Was A Crooked Man . ''
This was one of the very last songs recorded for the Sandinista !
album , at Wessex in September 1980 .
It is rumoured to have been written and recorded quickly in order to both fill space on the huge triple-album , and give Paul Simonon some royalties .
Indeed , the track is actually two versions of the same song - the original is then followed back to back by a dub remix by Mikey Dread , the Clash 's producer at the time , featuring authentic Trenchtown patois vocals from Dread and an echo-saturated production .
The song was one of the many more obscure tracks on Sandinista !
never to be played live by The Clash , probably because `` The Guns of Brixton '' was used live as Simonon 's signature song -LRB- he would swap instruments with singer Joe Strummer , who would play bass while Simonon sang lead vocals -RRB- .
