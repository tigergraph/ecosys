This soft and smoldering Blues number was a pre-release taster for Leonard Cohen 's 12th studio album , Old Ideas .
Released at the age of 77 , it was the Canadian singer-songwriter 's first LP containing new material for over 7 years .
`` I 've got no future , I know my days are few , '' he purrs shrugging his shoulders at the uncertain prospects for a man of his age .
`` I thought the past would last me , but the darkness got that too . ''
Despite not embarking on a tour since 1993 , Cohen was forced to go on the road in 2008 , following the alleged misappropriation of over US $ 5 million from his retirement by his longtime former manager , Kelley Lynch .
This left him close to bankruptcy and Cohen 's mammoth world tour lasted two and a half years and comprised 246 shows .
This is the only cut on Old Ideas to feature Cohen 's full touring band .
Reputedly the first song written for Old Ideas , the bluesy number is a resigned vision of the human condition .
Consequence of Sound reports that during a press preview of Old Ideas in London , Cohen was asked where the light came into `` The Darkness '' .
-LRB- The questioner was quoting the lyric from his 1992 track , `` Anthem '' : `` There is a crack in everything/that 's how the light gets in . '' -RRB-
`` It 's just the song that allows the light to come in , '' he responded .
`` It 's the position of the man standing up in the face of something that is irrevocable and unyielding and singing about it .
It 's the sort of position Zorba the Greek took ; that when things get really bad , you just raise your glass and stamp your feet and do a little jig and that 's about all you can do . ''
