This song finds a deadbeat boyfriend exchanging jabs with the girl with whom he is trying to reconcile .
It guest stars Banhart 's fiancée , Serbian photographer and artist Ana Kraš .
Banhart admitted , `` It 's so hard for me to write a sincere love song .
It 's got to be about what a piece-of-s -- t relationship we 're in now , always , somehow .
But there are some sincere things here obviously -- they 're all sincere , really , but you have to keep a sense of humor about it . ''
