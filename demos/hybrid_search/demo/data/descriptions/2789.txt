This song is a clear representation of the band 's views regarding the current state of the world .
The last line says , `` Peace , or Annihilation , '' which is referring to the war for oil , and the trouble in the Middle East .
The song also says , `` It 's your choice '' meaning that we have to decide for ourselves , and can no longer let our government make our decisions .
