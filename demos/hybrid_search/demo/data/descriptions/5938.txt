At a listening party for various media outlets Kelly explained that he played this break-up/make-up ballad for his girl over the phone at a time when they were having problems with their relationship , and she came right home .
`` I got my baby back with this one , '' Kelly said .
Songwriter and producer Chris `` Deep '' Henderson -LRB- Case , Jamie Foxx , Trey Songz -RRB- told HipHopDX.com how this song first caught R. Kelly 's attention : `` At one point , -LSB- R. Kelly -RSB- had the ` Blame It ' track ... before Jamie Foxx did , '' he explained .
`` He decided not to use the song ... -LSB- but -RSB- that 's what got me in the door to ` Hey , what else do you have ? '
So when I was called into the meeting , I thought it just was going to be a meeting with R. Kelly ... so I came -LSB- into the meeting -RSB- , and -LSB- there were -RSB- a bunch of other producers there ... it was funny because once I had got my seat ... I would see other people walk in the room after me and they had the same shocked look on their face , like ` I 'm about to have a meet - aw , damn ! '
... and judging from -LSB- which other producers were -RSB- in the lobby ... the first thing I took out ... -LSB- were -RSB- these up-tempo , club banger tracks .
I did that for a while ... -LSB- but -RSB- then I played one that I was almost finished with , and when I played -LSB- that track -RSB- , R. Kelly pulled his recorder out and started singing into it , like he was starting to vibe to it ... so I was like ` Shoot , if he 's open to listening to unfinished stuff , I 've got one more for you .
It 's just piano and me singing this idea , but if you like it , I 'll go and produce it ' ... I played him -LSB- what would become the beat to -RSB- ` Elsewhere ' ... and he was in shades and a hat the whole time , kind of just playing it cool ... but mid-way through ` Elsewhere , ' his shades came off , he stood up and just started staring at the speakers , so I knew that I had him .
