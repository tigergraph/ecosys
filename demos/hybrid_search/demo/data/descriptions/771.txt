This is the title track from the sophomore album of American Idol season five runner-up , Katharine McPhee .
It is one of six tracks co-written by McPhee and in an interview with AOL 's PopEater , she was asked how therapeutic she found the lyric-writing process to be .
The American Idol runner-up replied : `` It depends on the day and who I 'm in the room with .
A lot of times I was really stubborn going into some of the writing sessions because I did n't want to write that day or something .
But at the end I was really excited about what we did , and obviously all of it does n't make the record , but it 's cool to hear the finished product and have that memory of what it takes to go from a blank piece of paper to a full song . ''
