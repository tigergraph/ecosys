`` It 's an amazing song that I was really excited to put on the record , '' says Jake Owen .
And he explains the song as `` this guy is telling the story of his friend that passed away , and he says he basically learned from a guy that he does n't buy green bananas , he does n't play the lottery , ` and that 's just fine for me . ' '
I do n't own an umbrella , if it rains , I guess I 'm gon na get wet .
I do n't buy green bananas because I do n't plan that far ahead . '
It 's a really special song , and it really touches a lot of people . ''
`` This is a very true song about a guy I used to fish with , honest to God , growing up , '' recalls Jake .
`` He had a boat named Green Bananas .
He was an older fellow , he was my dad 's friend .
He was probably in his 50s , and my brother and I -- I have a twin -- we were probably 14 or 15 .
And I asked him one day why his boat was called Green Bananas .
We 'd been fishing on it forever and I 'd never asked him .
And he 'd had a buddy of his that had passed away when they were in their 30s or 40s .
And his buddy told him in the hospital , ` Man , do n't ever buy green bananas , because as you can tell , you never know what life 's gon na bring . '
I always remembered that .
And I just wrote that song kind of telling the story the same way that he told it to me .
And I just thought what a great way for people to remember life in such a simple way , and not be a downer kind of ` life is short , live it while you can ' song .
It 's got a great feel to it . ''
