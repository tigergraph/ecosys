This single continued George Michael 's string of solo hits , but it was a major departure from his typical sound .
It 's meant to recall jazz and the blues of earlier times , which was reinforced with the black-and-white music video .
This helped introduce him to a new audience , as it reached # 1 on the Adult Contempory charts.Michael wrote the lyrics , in which he expresses his uncertainties about finding romance due to the baggage of his past relationships .
This was the last of 6 singles to chart from the Faith album .
-LRB- thanks , Mike - Santa Barbara , CA , for above 2 -RRB-
