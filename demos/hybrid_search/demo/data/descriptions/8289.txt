This was a track from Farm , the ninth studio album by American alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr. .
The band formed in Massachusetts in 1984 , disbanded in 1997 until reunited in 2005 .
The subsequent album , 2007 's Beyond , proved to be a success , so two years later , the trio went into frontman J. Mascis ' studio and laid down the tracks for Farm .
Mascis said of this nine-minute-plus epic to Rolling Stone : `` That one 's a bit of a jam .
We still get on each others nerves - but when we play music , we get along just fine . ''
