The first track on the album , this song is about the success of the `` Tha Carter '' album series .
3 Peat , also Three Peat , is meaning the third time : Repeat , Threepeat .
-LRB- thanks , Will - New York , NY -RRB- The term `` 3 Peat '' was trademarked by the NBA coach Pat Riley , whose Lakers were trying for their third consecutive championship .
They did n't get it , but Riley continues to earn royalties from use of the term .
Vaushaun Brooks -LRB- aka Maestro -RRB- produced this track .
The producer and arranger told Rhapsody about this song : `` I made the track for Jeezy and originally he dissed it .
My friend Shanell Woodgett played it for Wayne and he jumped on it that night .
He made the song the length of the snippet .
I did n't put the full beat out there .
I put like two minutes to allow me to go through all the changes I had made to the track and that 's exactly how long he did the song for .
He did n't try to loop the two-track or nothing .
Also , a lot of producers , they have to say , ` Hey , put my -LSB- tag -RSB- on it , ' but Wayne worked my name into his verse . ''
Tha Carter III was the top selling album of 2008 , moving 2.88 million copies .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France -RRB-
