This is about a teenage couple getting married and staying together .
Many of Berry 's songs are written from the perspective of young people .
Berry invented a new word for the lyrics : `` Coolerator . ''
It means `` refrigerator . ''
This was featured in the 1994 film Pulp Fiction .
It was used in the scene where Uma Thurman and John Travolta dance to it in the twist contest at Jack Rabbit Slim 's .
-LRB- thanks , Edward Pearce - Ashford , Kent , England , for all above -RRB- This was one of the new batch of hits Berry produced after being released from his 1962-63 prison incarceration .
In 1977 , Emmylou Harris had a Top Ten country hit with her version , which she renamed '' -LRB- You Never Can Tell -RRB- C'est La Vie . ''
`` C'est la vie ' '' is French for `` That 's life . ''
