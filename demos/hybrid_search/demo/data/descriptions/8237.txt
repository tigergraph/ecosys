This song is about a woman becoming an ornament to her partner .
Studt explained to The Sunday Times January 13 , 2008 : `` There comes a point where you 're constantly together , but you may as well not have been there .
You have your uses -- you cook , you clean and someone has sex with you -- and you just become part of the furniture . ''
This was Amy Studt 's first single release for four years , in which she attempted to distance herself from her previous incarnation as a teenage pop singer .
