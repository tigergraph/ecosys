The song features a spoken word intro by '60s counter-culture activist , poet and ex-MC5 manager John Sinclair .
`` He was recording an album with Youth and was just hanging about the studio , '' recalled The View vocalist Kyle Falconer to the NME .
`` He was freestyling and coming up with lines and we were like , ` We 've got to get him on this . ' ''
Falconer explained the song 's inspiration to the NME : `` It 's easy to sit in your armchair and eat crisps , watch soap operas and let life pass you by .
It 's hard to make something precious , to achieve creative goals , you have to be driven .
This song was inspired by the thought that if you put the effort in then it could be possible to create something everlasting . ''
