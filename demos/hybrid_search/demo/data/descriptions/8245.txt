Vocalist Tom Higgenson -LRB- from Alternative Press magazine -RRB- : `` Mike -LSB- Retondo , bass -RSB- had this instrumental piece of guitar music floating around for years .
I always loved it , but did n't really know what to do with it .
Every time he would play it backstage , we would all say , ` Damn , we have to turn that into a song . '
I made him do a quick recording of it for me so I could try to write some lyrics and a -LSB- vocal -RSB- melody .
I could n't come up with anything , so it was kind of forgotten for a while .
Luckily , it popped into my head while I was sitting on a plane , waiting for take off .
I just started hearing this haunting melody in my head and jotted down some lyrics about being on the plane .
This song has a very nightmarish quality because so many people are scared of flying .
I think this is one of the most important songs for the feel and flow of this album . ''
