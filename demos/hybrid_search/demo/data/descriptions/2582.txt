He explained to Complex Magazine : `` Kids respect an honest motherf -- ker .
I f -- k up so I can show you about what not to do .

`` Cudi went on to explain how heavy his drug use became : `` I started doing cocaine to get through interviews , 'cause people wanted to know a lot about my personal life and I was n't prepared for a 60 Minutes interview every time .
Doing bumps I was able to get through the day , but then I would smoke weed to calm me down -- it was the only way I could get through the day without people noticing I was doing it . ''
