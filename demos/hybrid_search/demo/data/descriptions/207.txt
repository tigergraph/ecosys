This is the first single from Southern Rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd 's twelfth studio album , Gods & Guns .
It was their first release since 2003 's Vicious Cycle .
This was the official Theme Song of the WWE Breaking Point Pay-Per-View event on September 13th 2009 .
The band has experienced several tragedies , most notably the loss of several members in a 1977 plane crash .
This song was written after the death of original bassist Leon Wilkeson in 2001 .
Gary Rossington -LRB- guitar -RRB- told AntiMUSIC about the track : `` It 's kind of about us and me , and what we 've been through and done .
Anybody can relate to it that 's been through a lot and had a life go on .
A lot of stuff happens .
`` Johnny Van Zant -LRB- vocals -RRB- added : `` We wrote that before Vicious Circle .
Gary always keeps a cassette of stuff , he brought it in while we were in the studio , said ` ya 'll need to listen to this , man ; we can do something with this . '
`` Rickey Medlocke -LRB- guitar -RRB- concluded : `` That song actually was written quite a few years ago , right after Leon passed away .
What ended up happening was we listened to the song again and it was so appropriate for us today . ''
Though this song is a personal anthem about overcoming adversity , Rossington feels it strikes a universal chord .
He told Billboard magazine : `` Huey Thomasson -LRB- of The Outlaws -RRB- wrote that song with us-me , Johnny and Rickey - and he passed away a couple of years ago , so that shows you how long we were writing for this album .
That is kind of our story , but you can find a lot of people in life that are still unbroken .
You go through stuff and you keep going . ''
