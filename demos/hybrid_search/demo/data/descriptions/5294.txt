This song is about taking a chance and trying to succeed in life .
It starts with someone depressed who wants to go out and do more , but it 's hard .
One in a million succeed , and she 'll be labeled brilliant if she becomes a success .
She goes on about how little she has in her life and climbs the railing in order to do her swan dive .
She sees sharks -LRB- competitors -RRB- in the waters below but does n't care , since she has nothing to lose .
She has a vision of better things and she wants to go for it .
She says she 's going to prepare -LRB- vaccinations -RRB- for this journey and she 's going to go boldly because a little bird -LRB- America ? -RRB-
told her it 's easy .
Next she paints a visual of diving into the sidewalk instead of a pool of water , which could signify how unlikely it is to achieve success .
DiFranco crates a rather shocking visual with the line , `` I 'm gon na take out my tampon and start splashing around , '' meaning she 's going to call on the sharks with her blood from the tampon and the noise .
-LRB- thanks , daniel - new orleans , LA , for above 2 -RRB-
