British indie rock band Wild Beasts ' third album Two Dancers features a more synth-oriented sound than their previous two releases .
However , the band got through several synthesisers whilst recording .
Bassist Tom Fleming explained to Drowned in Sound : `` The synth used on this track was then to die immediately after , and this is its only legacy . ''
Fleming added that the synth they played for `` Reach a Little Further '' also `` died after the event . ''
Wild Beasts are well known for their liberal use of literary references , and this song sees them working two classic tragedies , Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein and Shakespeare 's Hamlet into the lyric .
The song sees the narrator listing the sacrifices he 'll make for his lover .
Fleming told the story of the song to Drowned in Sound : `` One of the first we wrote , in a demo session that predated the album by about 8 months .
Almost all of the sounds on this track are so-called `` real '' instruments , treated and filtered to sound unfamiliar .
This is a playful song , and if I may , a bit of a disco banger , or at least as close to one as we dared . ''
