Manics guitarist Richey James Edwards -LRB- from Melody Maker , June 19 , 1993 -RRB- : `` We took the title from a book on Van Gogh , although the song 's got nothing to do with Van Gogh .
It means something like ` the sadness goes on , ' and it 's about the way life does n't get any better as you get older .
It 's always a beautiful image every year when the war veterans turn out at the Cenotaph , and everyone pretends to care about them - but then they 're shuffled off again and forgotten .
I 'm much more sympathetic towards older people than towards my generation - I think they have a lot more dignity , and seem to be able to take care of their problems themselves .
People of my generation seems to be so selfish .
I 'm no exception , because you ca n't escape from the culture that surrounds you .
A phrase like ` Trade Unionism , ' and the idea of caring about the community you come from , is now seen as laughable - and of course , that 's a product of the political culture over the last 15 years . ''
