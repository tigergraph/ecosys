A huge fan of Blues music , Thorogood often sings about drinking , which is a common theme in the genr√© - one of his most popular songs is a cover of John Lee Hooker 's `` One Bourbon , One Scotch , One Beer . ''
In this song , Thorogood takes a self-deprecating approach as he sings about drinking , which is generally a social activity , is something he enjoys by himself .
The song takes a humorous tone , as many of the lyrics incorporate a name of a drink .
Budweiser is mentioned in the first verse , Jack Daniel 's and Jim Beam in the second , Johnny Walker -LRB- Black label and Red label -RRB- in the third , and Old Grand Dad in the last .
