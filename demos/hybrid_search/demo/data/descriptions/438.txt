Based in Manchester , but hailing from Kent and Northumberland , art-pop quartet Everything Everything was formed by frontman Jonathan -LRB- all surnames of the band members are fortuitously , `` Everything '' -RRB- in 2007 with friends from school and university .
This song was first released as a single in October 2009 .
It was re-issued the following year to tie in with the release of the debut album .
Man Alive .
Jonathan Everything told NME the album could have had a very different name .
`` I looked at all the lyrics and tried to pick a title out from that , '' the frontman explained .
`` For a long time we thought ` Taj Mahal ' was a really good title . ''
According to the press release this song is `` sung from the paranoid perspective of a post-traumatic R&B lothario during an air-raid . ''
Drummer Mike Everything explained to The Sun : `` I 've always been interested in the way R&B singers sing about very self-absorbed and detailed things like their cell phones , their diamond rings or their designer shoes .
I got to thinking what would happen if that superficial , shallow world was suddenly the centre of a war zone - like Iraq or Afghanistan - and how crazy it is that both places can co-exist in the world.The song title stands for My Keys , Your Boyfriend and it 's about a very petty love triangle which quickly becomes irrelevant once the house begins to be bombed .
