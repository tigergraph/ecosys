`` The Sun Smells Too Loud '' is the fifth track on the sixth studio album by Mogwai .
Typical of Mogwai tunes , it 's pure instrumental , is credited to the entire group , and runs a leisurely time of 6:58 .
Mogwai is a Scottish band from Glasgow , formed in 1995 .
Their style is frequently labeled `` Post-Rock , '' similar to Talk Talk and Sigur Ros .
We 'll agree with that .
However , you 're excused if you listened to them and said `` Shoegaze , '' `` Math Rock , '' or just plain `` Progressive Rock '' too , since they have connections to those styles .
The title `` The Sun Smells Too Loud '' is evocative of the psychological disorder known as `` synesthesia , '' in which a person senses stimulus in a cross-sensory way .
A person with synesthesia might perceive the letter `` V '' as being `` purple , '' or might associate the smell of fish with a train whistle , or might think that the taste of green beans feels scratchy , or other random sensory non sequitur .
The name `` Mogwai '' comes from the 1984 Steven Spielberg film Gremlins .
`` Mogwai '' are the cute , cuddly , Gizmo-form of the little beasties , before you feed them after midnight and they turn into the nastier , deadlier , title creatures .
In the film , the first mogwai is bought from an old Chinese fellow in a curio shop ; `` mogwai '' in Cantonese translates to `` evil spirit . ''
Now , after all that , Mogwai guitarist Stuart Braithwaite states that there 's no special significance to the name - they meant to come up with a better one , but never did .
The Hawk is Howling was the product of a failed commission .
Bass guitarist Dominic Aitchison told Uncut magazine : `` We 'd been asked to do the music for a South American film and had been given a time frame of five days , so we pulled this music for it out of thin air .
We were happy with what we produced , but they hated it and sacked us , so we reworked a lot of that music for The Hawk ... .
We had a brilliant time recording it and it 's really good fun to play live , although its really dour and probably a little bit too one-note . ''
