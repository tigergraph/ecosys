The song 's title evokes the classic movie The Wizard of Oz .
Sullivan explained this song on her website : `` The lions , tigers and bears reference represents my career in the music business .
Even though it can be pretty scary and overwhelming at times , I 've been doing it for so long -LRB- most of my life -RRB- that I can handle that .
That 's what I do .
Now , that love thing is a different animal - You ca n't see , hear or smell it .
It can reach out and grab you at the supermarket , the bus stop or even during a performance .
Being afraid of love and everything that goes with it , like not having complete control of your emotions and putting your heart in someone else 's hands to do with it what they please .
Having to pick up the pieces and try again if things go wrong .
-LRB- and they do -RRB- That 's scary .
But , in the end not trying is worst than failing so , here we go again . ''
When this song entered the Top 10 of the Hot R&B / Hip-Hop Songs chart , Sullivan became the first female artist to land three top 10 singles from her debut album since Ciara achieved the same feat with her Goodies set in 2004 .
Sullivan 's first two hits were `` I Need U Bad '' and `` Bust Your Windows . ''
This song was produced by the hip hop producer and keyboard player Salaam Remi , who also helmed `` Bust Your Windows for Sullivan . ''
It samples Remi 's song `` Sheila 's Playground . ''
