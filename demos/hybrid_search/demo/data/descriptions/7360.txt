Rucker recalled on his record label 's website : `` I wrote that with Patrick Davis and Dave Berg .
The song went round and round - management and I were n't really sure if it was what we needed .
Then we cut it and it was a big party .
This was the last song we waiting for - it came easily .
We also did it on our last day in the studio . ''
