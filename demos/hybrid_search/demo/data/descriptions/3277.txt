Cocker explained to the New Musical Express why he titled this instrumental after a small , oily fish : `` This girl at our school was n't particularly good-looking , but she became renowned for allowing boys to do things with her ... she was referred to as ` Pilchard . '
I quite like it being an instrumental because it gives me a chance to show off my guitar playing . ''
