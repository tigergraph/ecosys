The Running on Empty album is a tale of life on the road and the struggles of an itinerant musician .
Jackson Brown did n't write `` The Road , '' but the song fit very well on the set as it described the comfortless lifestyle filled with motels and strangers .
The song 's writer is Danny O'Keefe , who had a hit in 1972 with `` Good Time Charlie 's Got The Blues . ''
And while `` The Road '' sounds like it was written after that hit , it was actually composed earlier .
The song foreshadowed O'Keefe 's fate , as he found himself living the song when he toured to promote his hit .
In our interview with Danny O'Keefe , he said : `` For me the road was basically go out for six weeks and after six weeks you were usually sick of the road and sort of beat to death and poor , because unless you stay out there for a long period of time it 's very hard to recoup those expenses that you have when you 're carrying a band .
