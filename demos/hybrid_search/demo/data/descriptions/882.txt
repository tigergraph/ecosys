This is the title track and second single from dance-pop act Selena Gomez & The Scene 's second album .
The song was co-written and produced by Toby Gad , whose other credits include Beyonc√© 's `` If I Were a Boy '' and Fergie 's `` Big Girls Do n't Cry . ''
The other co-writer is Lindy Robbins who also co-penned Demi Lovato 's hit single , `` Here We Go Again . ''
The song 's music video has a desert setting and was premiered on September 3 , 2010 on Disney Channel straight after the first showing of Camp Rock 2 : The Final Jam .
Selena also recorded a Spanish version of this song titled `` Un Ano Sin Lluvia . ''
Selena said of this song in an interview with MTV , `` It 's basically one of my favorite songs on the record .
It 's kind of got a more feel-good , dance beat feel , I love it . ''
Selena explained to MTV News why she titled the album after this song : '' -LSB- I named the album after my single -RSB- because it 's the name of the first song I recorded to put on the record .
I feel like that song has a lot of meaning , and it also kind of was the start of what I wanted to base all the other songs around , '' she explained .
`` I mean , even down from putting the track listing and numbering it , I wanted to make sure I envisioned -LSB- fans -RSB- putting it in their car or putting it on their iPod and how I wanted them to listen to the record . ''
Little-known California rockers Luce alleged that Gomez , Robbins and Gad lifted the song 's chorus from their 2005 single `` Buy A Dog . ''
The band filed a $ 1 million lawsuit claiming the this track features a chorus that is `` virtually identical '' to their cut .
