McEntire told Great American Country : `` This is a cute song .
I loved it the first time I heard it .
They had horns on it and I said , ` Of course we 'll change it to fiddle and steel guitar . '
It 's real sassy .
A woman is walking into a bar and she 's looking for a man .

The line , `` I 'll have what she 's having '' was popularized in the 1989 movie When Harry Met Sally .
In an effort to prove how convincing a woman can be during intimacy , Sally simulates an orgasm right at the table while she and Harry are eating at a deli .
When she finishes her performance , an older woman at a nearby table says the famous line .
