This ode to the love for Drake and his musical family features Toronto-based R&B singer Abel Tesfaye , a.k.a. the Weeknd .
Drake has helped public awareness for The Weeknd , after he quoted a line from the track `` Wicked Games '' via Twitter and posted a link to the artist 's music on his blog .
A few months later the Canadian MC supplied guest vocals to `` The Zone , '' a track from The Weeknd 's second mixtape , Thursday .
Drake told Billboard magazine how his Toronto homie inspired Take Care .
`` Not only did he inspire me to get out there and try and sing better onstage , '' he said , `` but he inspired me just writing-wise , music-wise , just to better my product .
To hear someone else with an incredible body of work is very rare , so it 's very inspiring . ''
The Weeknd told Complex magazine that this was originally his song .
`` I had a hook and I had a second verse , '' he said .
`` And Drake heard it and he was like , ` F -- k , man . '
` There 's a second verse ? '
` Yeah , there was a second verse on it . '
` You 've got to play that for me ! ' ''
The Weeknd added that he hated his second verse .
`` That was a complete freestyle as well , '' he said .
`` I 'm glad Drake placed his vocals on it .
That song was so special to him .
I did n't hear that verse until maybe four or five months after I gave it to him . ''
Noah `` 40 '' Shebib , who co-produced the track , told MTV News : '' ` Crew Love ' is just a moment for Drake as far at the content of the record and what was going on around him in life and his people and his team .
That was just an important record for him to make , and Weeknd was someone he wanted to include on that . ''
