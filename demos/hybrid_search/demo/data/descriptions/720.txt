Twin brothers Benji -LRB- guitarist -RRB- and Joel -LRB- vocalist -RRB- Madden were raised by their devoutly Christian mother after their alcoholic father walked out on the family on Christmas Eve 1995 .
Despite their tough , punk image , the twins retain a strong Christian faith , giving thanks to God in their liner notes .
Benji explained to Alternative Press that this song is about their belief in God : `` To me , God and music go hand in hand .
At certain points in my life and my career , I 've lost my way just like any one of us .
No matter what happens or what I experience , God and music are always waiting for me with open arms .
This song says just that .
This is one that I really hope the GCFAM listen to closely : It 's really personal and special to me . ''
