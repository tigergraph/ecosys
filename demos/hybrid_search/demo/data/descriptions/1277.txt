This Funk song finds the Isleys summarizing Get Into Something 's theme of independence as they discuss the meaning of freedom .
Ron Isley explained to Rock Genius : `` I wanted to say you can do what you wan na do , say what you wan na say , live how you wan na live , go where you wan na go , that 's free .
That 's what it 's about .
Then you 're free , when you can do all these things -- what you should be able to do . ''
