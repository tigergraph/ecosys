This features Green engaging with Anthony Hamilton in a fierce call and response .
Hamilton also features on the album 's title track .
Green said of the American soul singer-songwriter on the EMI press release : `` On his records , Anthony is always singing about pleasing and satisfying his lady - I want you to be happy , I want us to be together .
I 've been preaching for 30 years and I said , that 's right , the more we need each other , the less difference we see between us .
You have to take a chance on love .
I know there are some hateful people in the world that would break your heart in an instant .
But the big man upstairs is saying you 've got to take a chance .
It 's better to love and be heartbroken than never to have loved at all . ''
