This song samples Dutch dance duo Bingo Players ' 2011 song `` Cry -LRB- Just a Little -RRB- , '' which peaked at # 7 in their native country as well as # 44 in the UK .
`` Cry -LRB- Just a Little -RRB- '' itself contains interpolations of Brenda Russell 's 1988 hit tune `` Piano In The Dark . ''
Flo Rida was born and raised in the 187th Street projects of Carol City , Florida , where he grew up with his mom and seven sisters .
The song 's music video sees the rap star return to his neighbourhood to tell the story of his struggle to get to the top .
`` Born and raised in Carol City , Florida , I went through more than any man should have to growing up in the projects , '' he says .
`` Now I 'm back for the kids .
This is the story of my struggle .
What 's yours ? ''
The French producing and songwriting duo soFly & Nius supplied the beat .
The pair also worked with Flo Rida on four other Wild Ones tunes , including the title track .
Regarding the transformation of `` Piano In The Dark '' into two dance hits , Brenda Russell told Billboard magazine : `` It 's pretty cool that artists like Flo Rida and Bingo Players can be inspired to interpret a song like ` Piano in the Dark ' in completely new genres .
As an artist and writer , it 's the highest compliment we can be paid .
I never imagined ` Piano ' as a dance hit -LRB- but -RRB- I 'm thrilled that it 's reaching a new generation of audiences . ''
