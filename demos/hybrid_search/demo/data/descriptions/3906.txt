Urban wrote this song with his frequent collaborator Monty Powell .
He discussed its meaning in a track by track interview with The Boot : `` Another take on a relationship song , saying stay in it , do n't run .
I did n't want to do it at first , because I do n't really subscribe to this sort of therapy , I do n't think you should shut out the light and go to bed and say it 's gon na be fine in the morning .
When we wrote this song , I remember saying to Monty -LRB- Powell -RRB- , ' I get it , and I know a lot of people do this , but I do n't think you should ever go to bed angry . '
So Monty said , `` Well , then , in the chorus let 's say , ` Baby , I love you , I 'm not goin ' to bed angry - but we 're not getting anywhere , so what should we do ? ' ''
I felt better having that disclaimer in there . ''
