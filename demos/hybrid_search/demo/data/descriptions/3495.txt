Dave Grohl wrote this acoustic instrumental piece for two miners in the Beaconsfield gold mine collapse in Tasmania , Australia , in 2006 .
A few days after the collapse , while the rescue was still being planned , one of the miners , Brant Webb , requested that an iPod be sent down to them , filled with Foo Fighters songs .
Dave Grohl heard about this story , and wrote a note to them stating , `` Though I 'm halfway around the world right now , my heart is with you both , and I want you to know that when you come home , there 's 2 tickets to any Foos show , anywhere , and 2 cold beers waiting for yous .
Deal ? ''
The men were safely rescued , and Dave Grohl later met up with Webb during the band 's 3-night acoustic tour at the Sydney Opera House in October 2006 .
Grohl played this piece for the meeting with the miner , and assured him it would be on the next Foo Fighters album .
-LRB- thanks , Bert - Pueblo , NM -RRB- Dave Grohl recorded this with American guitar virtuoso Katherine `` Kaki '' King , who provided the fingerpicking guitar work .
Grohl was moved to tears when told his tunes were used to lift the miners ' spirits a week before they were rescued after 14 days over half a mile underground .
Grohl recalled in the Daily Mail November 23 , 2007 , `` It was a massive moment in my life .
People have told me that our songs have helped them through a divorce or bereavement , but there was something special about two guys just trying to survive .
I wrote that track as a tribute and promised Brant that I 'd put it on the album . ''
