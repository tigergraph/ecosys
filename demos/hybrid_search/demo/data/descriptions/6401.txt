This is based on a recurring nightmare Robert Smith had as a child where he was eaten by a giant spider ; Smith says the song is about the fear of sleep .
The 1990 Brit award winning music video was inspired by David Lynch 's 1977 debut horror movie Eraserhead .
Lullabies are meant to soothe children to sleep , but some of them have surprisingly catastrophic endings .
The most famous lullaby , `` Rockabye Baby , '' ends : `` When the bough breaks , the cradle will fall And down will come baby , cradle and all '' According to Robert Smith , the lullabies his father sang to him had similarly tragic endings .
`` There would be something like ` Sleep now , pretty baby , ' and then there 'd be an ` Or you wo n't wake up at all ' coda to the song , '' he said .
This song had the Cure 's best chart placing in the UK .
