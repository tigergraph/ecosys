Olly links up with American rapper Flo Rida for the first single from his third album , Right Place , Right Time .
`` Getting Flo Rida on the record was kind of easy , in a way .
-LSB- It -RSB- was n't hard , '' he told MTV News `` I was expecting it to be a lot harder than it was .
We just literally sent him the track , his people the track and they heard it and really liked it .
And Flo Rida was like ' I really want to do it . '
So he was up for doing it . ''
The album title reflects the way everything has fitted in place for the British star to date .
`` Right Place , Right Time as a title sums up my career to this point , '' he said .
`` I 've worked hard in everything I 've done , doing what 's felt right , and everything has fit into place .
It sums up the sentiment for this whole album . ''
Regarding the song 's meaning , Olly explained : `` It 's written from experience .
I 'm sure lots of men have had girls in their life who 've been trouble .
You would n't normally fancy them , but there 's something that fixates you - a look in their eyes that entices you in .
She 's not marriage material , but you ca n't help wanting to be around her . ''
Murs tapped into a mixture of British and American influences as well as doing his own thing when crafting the song 's sound .
He told Radio.com : `` I do n't feel it 's unfair to say -LSB- `` Troublemaker '' -RSB- is just Jamiroquai and Maroon 5 because I feel there 's lots of other artists who 've got that same sort of vibe .
I just decided to do something completely different , completely random and really just try and be creative . ''
After sending Flo-Rida the track , the rapper returned it with his additional rhymes within a few days .
`` I just think the way the song is , '' Murs told MTV News , `` and when people hear it , they 'll understand why Flo Rida is such a perfect person to sing the song and get his vibe on it . ''
The song was Olly Murs ' fourth UK # 1 .
His previous chart-toppers were `` Please Do n't Let Me Go , '' `` Heart Skips A Beat '' and `` Dance With Me Tonight . ''
MTV News asked Olly what Flo Rida brought to the track ?
He replied : `` It was really the song .
I think sometimes , it 's getting someone that fits you but fits the project and fits what you 're doing .
For me , the record itself was called ` Troublemaker , ' and the song 's about a girl and we all end up getting girls in our life who are a bit of trouble at times .
And I 'm sure Flo Rida 's -LSB- known -RSB- lots of girls he 's after that are a bit trouble .
So he fit the bill in that sense .
I 'm so happy that when he did do it , it fit so well . ''
Murs told Glamour magazine that he decided to get a rapper on the tune after he and co-writers Claude Kelly and Steve Robson had trouble coming up with something for the middle 8 .
