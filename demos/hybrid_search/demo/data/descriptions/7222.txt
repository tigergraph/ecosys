This first single from Hard Bargain recalls Emmylou 's early years singing with her mentor , country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons , who died in 1973 from a drug overdose .
She said : `` I really just told that story the way I see it in my mind , the brief time we had and how I could n't imagine that Gram would n't be around forever .
Life goes on and unfolds before you , but those people and those events that change you forever are always with you .
It was an important event that determined the trajectory of my life and , more than anything , of my work . ''
Parsons ' tragic early death left Harris at an emotional and musical crossroads .
Her earliest signature song , `` Boulder to Birmingham , '' written shortly after Gram 's death , showed the depth of her shock and pain at losing her friend and mentor .
