This ballad finds Shins vocalist James Mercer recounting a frayed relationship .
He explained to The Sun that in this song he 's , `` singing to a friend who I am frustrated with and wanting to shake them . ''
The song 's eerie part post-apocalyptic , part magical fantasy video was directed by Hiro Murai , who also oversaw the equally-unsettling clip for St. Vincent 's `` Cheerleader . ''
We see a boy in a red cape and taped-on twig antlers discovering an abandoned car with his dog .
Meanwhile Mercer , croons apparently unfazed , as he is dragged toward a forest by a horde of dark cloaked monsters beasties .
