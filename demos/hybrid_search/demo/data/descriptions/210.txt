This was the first song penned by TFK frontman/songwriter Trevor McNevan for The End Is Where We Begin , but it only came after a struggle .
He told NewReleaseTuesday : `` I had been trying to hone in on what this record should sound like , what it should feel like , etc , and I started to get frustrated .
I was shooting in 10 different directions and was n't happy with my shots .
I remember going out to the deck , pulling my hair out , and looking up at the stars , and just crying out to God , wondering why I was feeling this way , why the uncertainty in direction ?
I 'm blessed to not be very acquainted with ` writer 's block ; ' it seems to never stop coming .
I give God all the glory for that and am grateful , although it 's sometimes very annoying when I ca n't shut it off!I remember hearing God say , ` Go back , ' so I went inside and pulled out our first two independent albums .
I remember listening to ` Small Town ' and ` Lift It ' again for the first time in years , and was standing there in tears .
God 's anointing was still on those songs .
I needed to get my head out of ` what makes a great song , ' and just write from the heart .
I shared this with my wife , and she said , ` Why do n't you write about this ?
About how the Holy Spirit speaks to you and how you feel right now . '
It hit me like a brick .
So I went upstairs and sat down with an acoustic for the rest of the night and wrote this song .
This song is as honest as it gets . ''
