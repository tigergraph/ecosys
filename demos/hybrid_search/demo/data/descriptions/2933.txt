This is a track from Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies , a title that refers to the American outlaws and gunslingers of the 19th century .
The outlaw theme runs throughout the album including this song as guitarist/vocalist Michael Poulsen explained on Full Metal Jackie 's nationally syndicated radio show : `` When I started writing , I had no idea where I wanted to go , '' he said .
`` It 's always tough to find the first four or five songs , because where do you start ?
Where do you want to go ?
It always ends up with me starting with ten songs that I trash because I need to be satisfied 100 per cent .
I need to have the goosebumps for my own material , so when I find the first three or four songs , I know exactly where I 'm going and when those songs came up , I can hear the Western themes , the inspiration from the old spaghetti Western movies .
`` That became a very organic flow to the record , '' he continued , `` those melodies from Western movies , so I thought , ` You 'd better start writing some lyrics about these outlaws and gunslingers ' ; it is movies that I 've been watching since I was a little kid .
My father was watching it all the time .
It 's just about the right time to do it , so when I start writing the lyrics , I bring some legendary outlaws and shady ladies to life , then pictures were just running in my head all the time and suddenly you feel you 're in that bubble where you 're like , ` Okay I 'm going somewhere , it 's definitely an outlaw theme . ' ''
Though some of the stories told on Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies are real -- like Lola Montez , the erotic dancer with her infamous `` Spider Dance , '' this cautionary tale of dabbling in the dark arts is entirely fictional .
