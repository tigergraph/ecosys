Cagle penned this ballad about the special bond between a dad and a daughter with Brad and Brett Warren .
The singer told The Boot that as a father of three girls himself , the song has a special meaning to him .
`` Being a dad changed me in so many ways , '' he explained .
`` When I saw Stella come out , her head was turned and she looked at me , and it was one of those things where when they put her in to measure her she was just hell-bent , get me out of here , wailing .
I walked over and put my finger down in that little hand and she kind of exhaled this peaceful breath , and grabbed my hand , like ` Oh , I 'm safe . '
She 'll never know how strong she is .
That child , she made me want to be better at everything .
Including being a human . ''
