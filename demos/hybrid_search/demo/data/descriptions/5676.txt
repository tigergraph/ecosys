Andrew Bird had the original inspiration for this during a trip to the Natural History Museum in Chicago .
Bird told Mojo magazine June 2009 : `` My friend Diana works in the bird department .
It yielded a pretty good line - ' A colony of dermestids undressed and digested/A grey spotted owl and wolf with lung disease . '
That comes from seeing the dermestid chamber , where a beetle colony devour flesh off a moose head to prepare the skeletal specimen .
Then you pull out this drawer and there 's three birds of paradise with crazy plumage and an extinct passenger pigeon , perfectly preserved with a tag saying ' 1895 . ' ''
Andrew Bird told Drowned in Sound : `` This may be my favorite .
Everything I was hoping to get with this record : a simple , sweet melody , interwoven rich acoustic textures and some words that do n't screw it all up - about everyday natural disasters , from the ` Rage of Niagara ' to decomposition on the forest floor .
I think of when I was seven , throwing myself face down on a pile of steaming mulch with my Sherlock Holmes magnifying glass and pretending to be microscopic . ''
