Billie Joe Armstrong starts off this new-wavey ยก Dos !
tune by declaring : `` I 'm too tired to be bored .
I 'm too bored to be tired , '' adding later that `` I do n't want your sympathy , I do n't want your honesty , I just want to get some peace of mind . ''
The lyrics make especially interesting listening in the light of his foul-mouthed tantrum at the iHeartRadio Music Festival after festival organizers cut Green Day 's set from 45 minutes to 25 .
Following his rant , Armstrong checked himself into a clinic .
A snippet of the song was featured in the soundtrack for the special Green Day themed level pack Angry Birds Friends game .
Some critics have commented on the similarities between this song 's beat and verse chord progression and that of the American Idiot track `` Give Me Novacaine . ''
