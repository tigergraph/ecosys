This is a track from the self-titled debut solo album by producer and TV on the Radio guitarist Dave Sitek , recorded under the guise of Maximum Balloon .
The song features David Byrne .
Sitek explained to The Sun how he hooked up with the former Talking Heads frontman for this track : `` A friend of mine who knows him said he would love the track and that was it .
I 'm like , ` How the hell did that happen ? '
I 've worked with David Byrne and David Bowie which blows my mind , so I guess David Hasselhoff is the only David left to work with . ''
Byrne 's lyrics for this song are not for the fainthearted .
Sitek told The Guardian : `` When I first heard what he 'd done it blew my mind .
Then it blew my mind all over again two weeks later when I realised what the lyrics are about .
The song is f -- ing twisted .
There 's actually an old porno magazine from the '70s called Apartment Wrestling - it featured scantily-clad girls grappling and having pillow fights with each other .
Pretty far out . ''
