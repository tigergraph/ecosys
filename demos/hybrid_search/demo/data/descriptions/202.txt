This is the title track of the third studio album by David Archuleta .
The American pop singer-song-writer penned the song with Joy Williams and Blair Daly , which was produced by Jeremy Bose .
David sings on the chorus , `` Nothing 's gon na break my stride , '' echoing Matthew Wilder 's 1983 hit `` Break My Stride . ''
On this song David sings , `` I could give up , I could stay stuck or I could move on , '' establishing the album 's theme of not stopping and giving in as things will turn out OK .
He told MTV News : `` It 's like , ` Yes , I do feel a little confused and it can be a little frustrating , but things will be OK . '
I want people to know that you do n't have to stay in that place and I feel like sometimes people get stuck there so much .
I wanted to get people out of there with this album . ''
