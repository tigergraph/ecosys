Want a brief history of red lipstick ?
Well , read on : Since time immemorial Red has been seen as a protective color .
The ancients believed the mouth was an invitation to mischievous spirits to enter the body and take possession of it , so they used to paint their lips red to stop evil forces.In the Middle Ages it was thought rouge meant sex and sin .
So , rather than incurring the wrath of the church , regal Italian women wore pink lipstick to show they could afford synthetic makeup , whilst in Elizabethan England , crimson-stained lips were popular and the queen herself painted on cochineal blended with gum arabic , egg white and fig milk .
It was only in the 1920s that mass makeup marketing brought red lipstick to the fore and by the 1940s , most women were following the lead of actresses and other female celebrities by applying bright red colour to their lips .
The song was produced by the British dubstep duo Chase & Status and is based around `` Saxon , '' a bonus track from the deluxe edition of their debut album , Nore Than Alot .
Chase & Status previously helmed three tracks on Rihanna 's fourth album , Rated R , including the UK single , `` Wait Your Turn . ''
