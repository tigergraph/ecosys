Peace vocalist Harrison Koisser told NME : '' ` Toxic ' was the last song written for the album .
It 's a song about giving stuff up that you do n't want to .
Or , actually not giving up stuff that you do want to . ''
Or not really knowing at all . ''
According to Harrison Koisser , `` There 's a really mysterious sound that happens between 01:31 and 01:32 .
No one knows what it is but we just left it . ''
Indie-Folk singer-songwriter Lucy Rose sang backing vocals .
She is also frequent contributor to Bombay Bicycle Club 's records .
