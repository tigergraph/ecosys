Dirty Projectors frontman and songwriter Dave Longstreth told Pitchfork about the background to this song about the artist 's preoccupation with creating images in a screwed up world .
`` That song asks a question about how we all spend so much energy creating and consuming these images of ourselves , '' he explained .
`` That 's the substance of our lives right now .
And that 's what any kind of art-making is as well - you 're just creating these emblems , images , pictures .
The song is meant to be a question about what that is ; I 'm not sure if it 's an affirmation or not .
That 's the tricky thing : Lyrically , I wanted the album to bring up specific things that we could all be on the same page about .
But then , when it comes down to it , I do n't feel like I have any answers .
I do n't know s -- t .
What I found out is that I have a lot of questions and weird , murky equivocations . ''
