La Bouche -LRB- `` Bouche '' is French for `` Mouth '' -RRB- , is the creation of the German producer Frank Farian , who is the same guy who brought us Boney M and Milli Vanilli .
For La Bouche , he teamed the American singers Melanie Thornton and Lane McCray .
`` Be My Lover , '' with a very Eurodance sound , was their breakout hit in the US and also a worldwide hit , sweeping the charts all over Europe , the UK , and Australia , and hitting # 1 in Germany and Sweden .
Their previous European release was `` Sweet Dreams , '' which also did very well around the world and was released as the second single in America after `` Be My Lover '' took off .
The album went five times platinum and nine times gold in various countries .
La Bouche lead singer Melanie Thornton died in 2001 in a plane crash in Switzerland , leading to the disintegration of the band .
One of her last career moves was to record a song , `` Wonderful Dream , '' a Christmas ballad recorded for a German Coca-Cola TV commercial .
Coca-Cola decided to run the ad anyway , and that single , too , was a posthumous hit .
Soundtrack appearances for this song include the films Romy and Michele 's High School Reunion -LRB- 1997 -RRB- and A Night at the Roxbury -LRB- 1998 -RRB- .
