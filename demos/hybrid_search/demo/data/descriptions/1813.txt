This song is taken from American Contemporary Christian singer-songwriter Sara Groves ' ninth album , Fireflies & Songs .
Sara told the story behind the song on her official blog : `` Sometimes when Troy , my husband , and I are in the midst of a disagreement , one of us will say something that 's really sarcastic or just so overt .
And being on the receiving end of that , it 's like , ` Honey , it 's me ... Sara . '
Or vice versa .
We just forget who we 're talking to and the value of that person .
For whatever reason , you cross that line where sensitivity and tenderness are discarded .
You 'd never talk to anyone else like that or treat someone else like that .
Troy and I are working on that - talking to each other and interacting with each other in those situations in the way we would a complete stranger . ''
Fireflies & Songs earned enough votes from a panel of ten music critics to be named Christianity Today 's Album of the Year .
The magazine explained their choice : `` Already known for her transparent songwriting , Sara Groves gets even more piercingly honest on this , her ninth album .
Whether her relationship with God , marital tension , or a private battle with anxiety , it 's poetically spilled forth in Groves ' call for the church to ` live confessionally . '
And paired with less poppy , stripped-down arrangements , her achingly clear vocal remains front and center .
This is vintage Groves -- yet more herself than ever . ''
