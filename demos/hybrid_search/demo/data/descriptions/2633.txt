`` This is the first true love song I 've ever written , '' Beau Bokan said to IGN , speaking of this song .
`` I wrote it for my girlfriend and the title came when we spent 40 days apart .
She wrote a song about me first and I used a line from her song it the chorus . ''
Because of this , Bokan 's tendency to explore his own emotions through Blessthefall songs expands into uncharacteristically optimistic territory .
As its origins suggest , `` 40 Days ... '' has a counterpart song .
The companion song , '' ... and Counting '' appears on Synth-Pop singer Light 's album , Siberia .
It shares a common theme as well as the line `` When I fall asleep I feel you with me , until I fall asleep and you are with me . ''
Bokan and Light , who were at the time engaged , married in 2012 .
Musically the song showcases a softer side of the band , while lyrically it is extremely sentimental and tender .
Bokan said that the band wanted to demonstrate the scope of their songwriting abilities by producing a track that could conceivably be played at a wedding .
`` 40 Days ... '' was the second song released off the band 's 2011 album , Awakening .
The album debuted at # 32 , making it the band 's highest charting release to date .
Critics noted improved performances from all the band members as well as increased diversity of songs , while wondering if the inclusion of several softer numbers indicated a new direction for the band .
