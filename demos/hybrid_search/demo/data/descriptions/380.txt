In our interview with Amanda Palmer , she called this song `` A commentary on kids mentally tuning out of reality . ''
Palmer said the inspiration for this song came from the people she toured with , who played guitar all night on stage and then played Guitar Hero for the rest of the night .
It was written to express how lazy and ungrateful people can be and how regretful they can be after they realize what they 've wasted .
The video was shot at Lexington High School in Lexington , Massachusetts , where Palmer went to school .
It was shot the same day as the video for `` Strength Through Music '' and featured student from the drama department .
