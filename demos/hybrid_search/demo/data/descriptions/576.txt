Red Rider was led by guitarist Tom Cochrane , who had a solo hit in 1991 with `` Life Is A Highway . ''
He wrote this song after reading about Raoul Wallenberg , who worked to free Hungarian Jews during World War II .
The song speaks against the oppression of Jews in America , which Cochrane felt was far less overt but still disturbing .
Cochrane even mentions the `` Final Solution '' in the lyrics , which refers to Hitler 's wish that all Jews be eliminated .
