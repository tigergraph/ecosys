This is one of three songs on Sounds of the Universe that vocalist Dave Gahan has a writing credit for .
He told the The Guardian March 21 , 2009 that this track 's doubled up name was due to principal song writer Martin Gore 's concern regarding sharing song titles with other artists .
Gahan explained : `` Martin does that .
He 's very particular about his song titles .
At the last minute he 'll change the title and he worries I think if there 's another song with the same name .
I imagine him Googling it .
For instance Miles Away/The Truth Is on this album was just Miles Away .
Then Martin said , ` You know there 's a Madonna song called Miles Away ? '
So it was changed . ''
