This was originally intended to be the first single from English dance group Booty Luv 's second album .
However the LP was eventually cancelled , due to the song 's poor chart placing .
Co-vocalist Cherise Roberts told Digital Spy about the song : `` It 's so straightforward we hardly need to explain it !
Sometimes you go to a club , catch a guy 's eye and have an immediate connection with him .
It gets to the end of the night and you 're like ` Oh , I wish he 'd said something to me ' .
The song 's basically us saying , ` If you 've got something to say , come and say it before it 's too late ' . ''
