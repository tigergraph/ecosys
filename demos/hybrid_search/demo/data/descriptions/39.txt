This song was written and originally recorded by the German singer-songwriter Nico for her 1970 album Desertshore .
Neko Case explained to American Songwriter magazine why she decided to cover the tune : `` I have always loved the song , '' she said , `` and sometimes you need a reason to cover something and I thought , ` That song is just so comforting even though it 's so sad . '
And you know , that song has been comforting me forever .
And from a technical standpoint , I thought , ` Well , I ca n't sound anything like Nico , I do n't have her incredible low range . '
So I did n't do it on a piano the way she does it , I tried to do it differently . ''
`` But people focus on very different parts of Nico 's career , '' she continued , `` like the Velvet Underground periods and Chelsea Girl and records like Desertshore do n't get their due .
Or not that they do n't get their due , I just do n't think people are as familiar with it , because it is odd . ''
