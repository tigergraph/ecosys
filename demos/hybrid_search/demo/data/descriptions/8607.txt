This club banger is a single by the Los Angeles electro-hop duo LMFAO .
The song was released on January 25 , 2011 via Interscope Records .
The song spotlights shuffling , which LMFAO 's Redfoo told Billboard magazine is part of Sorry For Party Rocking 's focus on dance in general .
`` Before we just kind of partied and had some personal moves , '' he noted , `` but now there 's dances that are out there that people are doing and shuffling is one that really caught my eye and it felt so good when I was doing it , so we just kind of made that song about shuffling . ''
According to Redfoo , the original chorus lyrics were , `` I feel it in my soul tonight , everybody 's gon na have a good time . ''
Redfoo is the son of Motown founder Berry Gordy , so he knows that getting a lyric just right can make a huge difference in a song , something he may have learn in his time hanging out with Smokey Robinson .
Thinking of the song as something you 'd hear when you walk into a party , he changed the lyric to `` Party rock is in the house tonight , everybody just have a good time . ''
`` The ` Just ' was key , '' said Redfoo .
`` I made it a command , to focus people on what to do now that we 're here together .
Our lyrics are very calculated , even if they appear simple . ''
The song 's music video is a take on the 2002 British zombie movie 28 Days Later in which Redfoo and Sky Blu wake from a party induced coma to find the world possessed to dance to this song .
The director Mickey Finnegan explained that , `` The concept of the video , there 's been an epidemic , the world has gone crazy , as soon as the song came out , everyone got possessed and all they want to do is to shuffle , everyone is a shuffler . ''
Redfoo told Digital Spy he and SkyBlu were n't surprised at the song 's success .
He said : `` We made a decision for that to be the first single from the album for the very reason that we thought it could be a number one song .
It 's a song that is quite unique as it 's a party track that actually talks about how to party .
It 's like an instruction to dance .
We were excited about it when we first finished it , especially as it took over year to make . ''
The song was declared by Billboard magazine to be their 2011 song of the summer .
Billboard 's Songs of the Summer chart ranks the most popular songs based on chart performance from Memorial Day through Labor Day .
`` We created a tool for people to use to get hyped up at their party , on their boat , at the club , at the gym , etc. .
People love it ... it feels amazing ! ''
Redfoo told Billboard upon hearing the news .
`` Because of how hard we worked on mixing the record and the dedication that went into the video , it was clear from the beginning that our goal was to take the party rock sound to number one .
`` LMFAO were the first duo to top the Songs of the Summer chart since 1996 when another dance anthem , Los Del Rio 's `` Macarena -LRB- Bayside Boys Mix -RRB- '' was the seasonal leader .
Worldwide , this was the second-best-selling single of 2011 , following `` Rolling In The Deep '' by Adele .
The song 's party lasted 68 weeks on the Hot 100 - the longest ever residence by a former # 1 .
Only Jason Mraz 's # 6-peaking `` I 'm Yours '' -LRB- 76 weeks , 2008-09 -RRB- and LeAnn Rimes ' # 2 hit `` How Do I Live '' -LRB- 69 weeks , 1997-98 -RRB- have spent more time on the tally .
The song contains the iconic phrase , `` Everyday I 'm shufflin ' , '' in the chorus , which Rick Ross claimed is an unauthorised interpolation of the lyric , `` Everyday I 'm hustlin , ' '' from his 2006 single , `` Hustlin ' . ''
The Maybach Music Group bawse , along with Jermaine `` Mayne Zayne '' Jackson -LRB- no , not that one -RRB- , filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against LMFAO in which they claimed that despite the slight change it constitutes `` an unauthorized derivative work . ''
The suit also cited the numerous and lucrative licensing opportunities the song generated in TV shows , video games and commercials , as well as LMFAO 's clothing line , Party Rock Clothing , which features the phrase on T-shirts and other clothing items .
Ross has some experience with copyright infringement lawsuits .
The rapper , born William Roberts II , took his stage name from the drug kingpin `` Freeway '' Ricky Ross , who sued over the appropriation .
The original Ross lost the suit after years of appeal .
The track features singer Lauren Bennett from the international girl group Paradiso Girls and newcomer GoonRock .
LMFAO previously did a remix for GoonRock 's track `` We Came Here to Party . ''
The English-born Bennett took part in the UK version of X Factor back in 2006 as part of a duo called Fusion who were dropped at the Boot Camp stage .
Her connection with the party rock movement stems from her association with Paradiso Girls , an ill-fated attempt by Jimmy Iovine to create a European spin -- off of his other girl group The Pussycat Dolls .
GoonRock -LRB- Jamahl Listenbee -RRB- , who co-wrote and co-produced this song , is a childhood friend of Redfoo and was also in his late 30s when the song hit .
He says when they started working on the song , it was intended for Flo Rida , but they decided to record it as LMFAO .
Says GoonRock : `` Even though it was for another artist -LRB- Flo Rida -RRB- , by the time we realized that it was gon na be for us we really did sit and say , ` let 's change the world . '
Now ` change the world ' is probably too big for what this song is , it 's really just a feel good song that everybody can get into , but that 's what we said - ` let 's change the world .
Let 's do something that will make everything crazy and make everyone feel good in the club .
Let 's just do the best s -- t we can do . '
That energy is what we went into it with and it really carried through throughout the song .
Every part was paid attention to .
We wanted to take the listener on a ride .
We wanted to do something great . ''
This was the first song with the word `` anthem '' in its title to reach the top 10 of the Hot 100 .
The previous best charting anthem tune was `` Player 's Anthem '' by Junior M.A.F.I.A. , which peaked at # 15 in 1995 .
Three weeks after it reached the top tier of the chart , James Aldean 's `` Dirt Road Anthem '' jumped from # 23 to # 9 to become the second title sporting the word ` anthem ' to reach the top 10 .
This was only the second Hot 100 chart-topper to sport the word `` party '' in its title .
For the first to do so , we have to go back to June 1st and 8th 1963 when Lesley Gore celebrated two weeks at # 1 with `` It 's My Party . ''
The song was the best-selling song on the UK version of iTunes in 2011 .
Adele 's `` Someone Like You '' finished second with Maroon 5 's `` Moves Like Jagger '' in third place .
The video marks the first time Redfoo and his LMFAO partner SkyBlu used a choreographer .
He acknowledged to Billboard that , `` now I 'm definitely more conscious of how I 'm dancing .
But it 's not , like , super choreography moves .
We 're not competing with Chris Brown or anything like that . ''
The song 's 47-week drop from # 1 until it fell out of the Hot 100 broke the previous record of 44 weeks descending from the top spot set by Savage Garden 's '' `` Truly Madly Deeply '' in 1998 .
