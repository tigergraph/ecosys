This is about a man who is pursuing a woman , but the woman does n't return the interest because she is still in mourning for her previous lover , and hence she always dresses in black .
The depressing subject matter is hidden by the upbeat music .
-LRB- thanks , Andy - Arlington , VA -RRB- This song uses a 6/8 time signature , similar to a waltz .
This was the first 50/50 Lennon/McCartney song written since `` I Want To Hold Your Hand '' a year earlier .
They wrote it together sitting practically nose to nose at John 's Kenwood Estate .
There is speculation that the song was written about mourning the loss of Stuart Sutcliffe after he died of a sudden brain hemorrhage .
The song was a 50/50 effort by both Lennon and McCartney , but started by Lennon as a response to his own mourning process -LRB- which he never really got over -RRB- .
The `` baby in black '' would be photographer Astrid Kircherr , who dated Sutcliffe before he died .
This is one of several Beatles songs with a dual melody line - `` If I Fell '' is another .
McCartney and Lennon sang into the same microphone , making it hard to distinguish which is the main melody line .
Sheet music of the song usually displays both .
-LRB- thanks , Bertrand - Paris , France , for above 3 -RRB-
