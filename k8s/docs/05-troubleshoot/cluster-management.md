## Troubleshooting Steps for updating cluster

- Verify the CPU and memory resources of the cluster Custom Resource (CR) have been updated:

  ```bash
  kubectl get tg test-cluster -o json -n tigergraph|jq .spec.resources

  {
    "requests": {
      "cpu": "2",
      "memory": "8Gi"
    }
  }
  ```

- Ensure the CPU and memory resources of the cluster's StatefulSet have been updated:

  ```bash
  kubectl get statefulset test-cluster -o json  -n tigergraph|jq .spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources
  {
    "requests": {
      "cpu": "2",
      "memory": "8Gi"
    }
  }
  ```

  If the resources haven't been updated, the cluster might be in another process, such as upgrading or scaling. In this case, check the cluster's status to determine the ongoing process. If the resource update is not initiated, you may need to wait for the last operation to complete:

  ```bash
  kubectl tg status --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph

### Potential failure of update

- If the updated resources (CPU or memory) exceed the available resources of the Kubernetes (K8s) cluster, the pods of the cluster will remain in a pending state. In such cases, you need to adjust the cluster configuration to allocate suitable resources:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -l app=test-cluster,tigergraph.com/cluster-pod=test-cluster -n tigergraph
  
  NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  test-cluster-0   0/1     Pending   0          58s
  test-cluster-1   0/1     Pending   0          58s
  test-cluster-2   0/1     Pending   0          58s
  ```

- License updates via the K8s Operator are not supported yet. You can perform a license update using the following methods:
  - Use the `kubectl tg update` --license ${LICENSE} command (supported in version 0.0.7).
  - Use the License function in the GUI to access the Admin Portal for updates.
  - Use `gadmin config entry license` to update the license in the pod. Refer to the TigerGraph Docs for more information.

- Resizing Persistent Volumes (PV) via the K8s Operator is not yet supported. Please refer to the [manual documentation](../07-reference/expand-persistent-volume.md) for instructions.

## Troubleshooting Steps for upgrading cluster

- Verify that the Docker image of the cluster CR has been updated:

  ```bash
  kubectl get tg test-cluster -o json -n tigergraph|jq .spec.image
  
  "docker.io/tigergrah/tigergraph-k8s:3.8.0"
  ```

- Ensure the Docker image of the cluster's StatefulSet has been updated:

  ```bash
  kubectl get statefulset test-cluster -o json  -n tigergraph|jq .spec.template.spec.containers[0].image

  "docker.io/tigergrah/tigergraph-k8s:3.9.0"
  ```

  If the images haven't been updated, the cluster might be in another process, such as resource updating or scaling. Check the cluster's status to determine the ongoing process. If the cluster upgrade is not initiated, you may need to wait for the last operation to complete:

  ```bash
  kubectl tg status --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph
  ```

- Ensure the upgrade process completes successfully. Verify the following:
  
  - The cluster status should be "Normal," and the actual image version should match the expected version:

    ```bash
    kubectl tg status --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph
    ```

  - Check the status and version of the TigerGraph cluster by executing the following commands:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it test-cluster-0 -n tigergraph -- /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/cmd/gadmin version
    kubectl exec -it test-cluster-0 -n tigergraph -- /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/cmd/gadmin status -v
    ```

### Potential failure of upgrading

- If you set a misconfiguration upgrade version, the pods of the cluster will be in ErrImagePull or ImagePullBackOff state, then you need to update the cluster configuration to correct the version.

  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -l tigergraph.com/cluster-pod=test-cluster -n tigergraph

  NAME             READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
  test-cluster-0   0/1     ErrImagePull       0          63s
  test-cluster-1   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          63s
  test-cluster-2   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          63s

  kubectl tg update --cluster-name test-cluster --version ${CORRECT_VERSION} -n tigergraph
  ```

- Rollback version of TigerGraph is not supported

  Operator Version 0.0.9 (Please note that this issue persists across all versions of the operator and may continue to be encountered in future releases)

  A unique scenario arises during the upgrading process when attempting to downgrade the TigerGraph cluster from a higher version to a lower version. For instance, moving from version 3.9.2 to 3.9.1. While the rolling update process will initially proceed successfully, an issue arises during the execution of the UpgradePost job due to the downgrade being disabled. Consequently, this prevents the ability to revert to a previous version for recovery purposes.

  Should the need to revert to the previous version arise, a two-step process is necessary. First, the cluster must be deleted, and subsequently recreated with the identical cluster name. This process enables the rollback to the desired version and facilitates the restoration of normal operations.

## Troubleshooting Steps for scaling cluster

### Expansion

- Ensure that the pods of the cluster have been scaled up to the expected size:

  ```bash
  # test-cluster is the name of the cluster
  # The example below tries to scale the cluster size from 3 to 5
  kubectl get pod -l tigergraph.com/cluster-pod=test-cluster -n tigergraph

  NAME             READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
  test-cluster-0   1/1     Running             0          17m
  test-cluster-1   1/1     Running             0          17m
  test-cluster-2   1/1     Running             0          17m
  test-cluster-3   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          8s
  test-cluster-4   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          7s
  ```

- Ensure the expansion job is running or has completed successfully:

  ```bash
  # replace test-cluster with you tigergraph cluster name
  kubectl get job -l job-name=test-cluster-expand-job -n tigergraph

  NAME                      COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
  test-cluster-expand-job   0/1           4m13s      4m13s
  ```

  If the expansion job fails, we can check out the logs of the job.

  ```bash
  # replace test-cluster with you tigergraph cluster name
  kubectl get pod -l job-name=test-cluster-expand-job -n tigergraph

  NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  test-cluster-expand-job-6jk42   1/1     Running   0          5m38s

  kubectl logs test-cluster-expand-job-6jk42 -n tigergraph

  ```

- Ensure that the expansion operation has been performed successfully:

  - Check the status of the cluster CR:

    ```bash
    kubectl tg status --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph
    ```

  - Check the cluster status by executing gadmin:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it test-cluster-0 -n tigergraph -- /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/cmd/gadmin status -v
    ```

#### Potential failure of expansion

- If the K8s cluster's resources (CPU or Memory) are insufficient to expand the TigerGraph cluster, you have two options based on the Operator version:

  - For Operator versions 0.0.3 and earlier, recreate the cluster with the same cluster name, which will load the remaining cluster data for recovery.

  - For Operator versions 0.0.4 and higher, update the size to match the K8s cluster's available resources or reset the cluster to the previous configuration.

- The expanding job fails again after retrying three times

  - If you back up the cluster before expansion, you can restore it with the backup package directly.

  - If there is no backup package, it has to do a complex manual recovery, so we’d better backup the cluster before expansion.

- Repeated pod restart after shrink/expand operations since GPE is not ready in-time causes healthy check failed. After Expansion/Shrink ends, services such as GPE may take a while to switch from warmup to running. This process may exceed 40 seconds, which is the upper limit of the health check. If the services of one or more TG nodes, but not all TG nodes, are still in the warmup state, their pods will be removed and rebuilt. This may cause repeated pod restarts. There will be about 5-12 times, depending on the amount of data, until the TG Service status of all pods is normal. At present, at the Operator level, it is impossible to limit such waiting time, or perceive the maximum warmup time, and it is also impossible to configure such waiting time arbitrarily.
solution

  - Wait for all services to return to normal status before taking any action.

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pods tg-cluster-1

### Shrinking

- Ensure that the shrinking job is running or has completed successfully:

  ```bash
  # replace test-cluster with you tigergraph cluster name 
  kubectl get job test-cluster-shrink-pre-job -n tigergraph

  NAME                          COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
  test-cluster-shrink-pre-job   0/1           21s        21s
  ```

  If the shrinking job fails, you can check the job logs:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -l job-name=test-cluster-shrink-pre-job -n tigergraph

  NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  test-cluster-shrink-pre-job-jzlhm   1/1     Running   0          2m11s

  ```

- Ensure that the shrinking operation has been performed successfully:

  - Check the status of the cluster CR:

    ```bash
    kubectl tg status --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph
    ```

  - Check the cluster status by executing gadmin:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it test-cluster-0 -n tigergraph -- /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/cmd/gadmin status -v
    ```

#### Potential Causes

- The shrinking job fails again after retrying three times

  - If you have a backup of the cluster before shrinking, you can restore it directly using the backup package.

  - If there is no backup package, manual recovery is a complex process, so it's recommended to backup the cluster before shrinking.

## Troubleshooting Steps for External Service Accessibility

### TigerGraph GUI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TigerGraph 3.6.3 doesn't support session affinity in HA env

In TigerGraph 3.6.3, Session Affinity is not supported. Direct external access through the Service (SVC) may lead to the following issues:

1. The TigerGraph GUI application may repeatedly prompt an authentication error after login because authentication occurs on one node, and requests sent to the GUI may be directed to other nodes.
2. Sending HTTP/HTTPS requests to the GUI service may yield similar results.

    ```bash
    curl -H "Cookie: TigerGraphApp=5eaf48c3-cb0b-4c78-9f27-7251c53dc0bc"    http://34.29.233.2:14240/api/loading-jobs/ldbc_snb/meta
    {"error":true,"message":"You are not authorized to use this API.","results":{}}%
    ```

- Solution

1. Use the latest version of TigerGraph that supports Session Affinity.

2. To enable Session Affinity, edit the service (SVC) configuration:

    ```bash
    kubectl edit svc tg-cluster-1-gui-external-service         
    # edit the sessionAffinity as below
    sessionAffinity: ClientIP
    sessionAffinityConfig:
    clientIP:
        timeoutSeconds: 1800

    ```

## Troubleshooting Steps for customizing and updating license/TigerGraph configurations

### Customizing TigerGraph configurations during initialization

The init-job may fail due to wrong TigerGraph configurations. Check the logs of the init-job to find the root cause.

```bash
kubectl get pod -l job-name=test-cluster-init-job -n tigergraph
```

The output should be similar to the following:

Use `kubectl logs` to check the logs of the init-job:

```bash
kubectl logs test-cluster-init-job-2j4x4 -n tigergraph

```

The error message `[  Error] config entry WRONG_CONFIG not found` means that you have set a wrong configuration entry in the CR. Check the CR and make sure the configuration entry is correct according to the [Configuration Parameters](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/current/reference/configuration-parameters). Once you have corrected the configuration entry, you can update the CR and wait for the init-job to be recreated automatically.

### Updating TigerGraph configurations and license when cluster is running

You can updae TigerGraph configurations and license when the cluster is running. This will trigger a config-update job to update the configurations and license in the cluster. The config-update job may fail if you set a wrong configuration entry or wrong license in the CR. Check the logs of the config-update job to find the root cause.

```bash
kubectl get pod -l job-name=test-cluster-config-update-job -n tigergraph
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```bash
NAME                                   READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
test-cluster-config-update-job-9p6bt   0/1     Error    0          18s
```

Use `kubectl logs` to check the logs of the config-update-job:

```bash
kubectl logs test-cluster-config-update-job-9p6bt -n tigergraph
```

If the output is like

```bash
Warning: Permanently added '[test-cluster-0.test-cluster-internal-service.tigergraph]:10022' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
[Wed Dec 20 07:07:22 UTC 2023] Start updating TigerGraph configurations
[  Error] config entry WRONG_CONFIG not found
[  Error] ParameterErr (failed to set one or more config entries)
```

You need to check the CR and make sure the configuration entry is correct according to the [Configuration Parameters](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/current/reference/configuration-parameters).

If the output is like

```bash
Warning: Permanently added '[test-cluster-0.test-cluster-internal-service.tigergraph]:10022' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
[Wed Dec 20 07:12:43 UTC 2023] Start setting license
[  Error] ExternalError (failed to set license; token contains an invalid number of segments)
```

You need to check the CR and make sure the license is correct.

Once you correct TigerGraph configurations and license in the CR, the config-update job will be recreated automatically.
