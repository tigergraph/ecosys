# TigerGraph Cluster Deployment Troubleshooting

This document provides guidance on troubleshooting common issues encountered during the deployment of a TigerGraph cluster in Kubernetes.

## Troubleshoot Steps

In the following steps, it is assumed that the operator has already been successfully installed within the `tigergraph` namespace, and that the cluster has been named `test-cluster`. However, please ensure to make appropriate adjustments based on your specific circumstances and environment.

### Check the pods of the TG Cluster

Ensure that all the pods of the cluster are running, and the READY figure is 1/1. Starting from Operator version 0.0.7, sidecarContainers are supported. If you have X sideContainers, the READY figure should be (1+X)/(1+X).

```bash
kubectl get pod -l tigergraph.com/cluster-name=test-cluster,tigergraph.com/cluster-pod=test-cluster -n tigergraph

NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test-cluster-0   1/1     Running   0          11h
test-cluster-1   1/1     Running   0          11h
test-cluster-2   1/1     Running   0          11h
```

If the status of a Pod is not `Running`, it might be in `Pending` or `PullImageError` state. In such cases, you can check detailed information about the specific pod using:

```bash
kubectl describe pod test-cluster-0 -n tigergraph
```

- Insufficient CPU or Memory

  If a pod is in a `Pending` state, it might be due to insufficient CPU or memory resources. You can identify this issue by checking the pod's status:
  
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -l app=test-cluster,tigergraph.com/cluster-pod=test-cluster -n tigergraph

  NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  test-cluster-0   0/1     Pending   0          58s
  test-cluster-1   0/1     Pending   0          58s
  test-cluster-2   0/1     Pending   0          58s
  ```

  Inspect the details of the pending pod to find the root cause at the bottom of the output:

  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod test-cluster-0 -n tigergraph

  Name:           test-cluster-0
  Namespace:      tigergraph

  ```

  You may encounter messages like `Insufficient CPU` or `Insufficient memory`. In this case, you should adjust the resource allocation for the cluster using the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl tg update --cluster-name test-cluster --cpu 4 --memory 8Gi -n tigergraph
  ```

- Nodes donâ€™t match nodeSelector/affinity

  Starting from Operator version 0.0.7, nodeSelector, affinity, and tolerations are supported. If you provide rules in the Custom Resource (CR), and your pod is in a `Pending` state, you can check for the following events:

  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod test-cluster-0 -n tigergraph
  ```

  Look for events like:

  ```bash
  Events:
    Type     Reason             Age                   From                Message

  ```

  This indicates that the nodes cannot meet your affinity or nodeSelector rules. You can update your rules using the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl tg update --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph --affinity affinity-config.yaml
  ```

- Incorrect docker image

  If the TigerGraph Docker image version is incorrect, the pod status may be `ErrImagePull` or `ImagePullBackOff`. You can identify this issue by checking the pod status:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -l tigergraph.com/cluster-pod=test-cluster -n tigergraph
  
  NAME             READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
  test-cluster-0   0/1     ErrImagePull       0          63s
  test-cluster-1   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          63s
  test-cluster-2   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          63s
  ```

  Check the detailed error by examining the pod's events:

  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod test-cluster-0 -n tigergraph

  Look for messages indicating issues with the image, such as `Error: ErrImagePull` You should correct the image version using the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl tg update --cluster-name test-cluster --version 3.9.0 -n tigergraph
  ```

- Incorrect PVC with non-existent StorageClass

  If you specified a non-existent or unusable StorageClass when creating a cluster, the cluster's pods may be stuck in a `Pending` state. To diagnose the issue, first check the pod statuses:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -l app=test-cluster,tigergraph.com/cluster-pod=test-cluster -n tigergraph

  NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  test-cluster-0   0/1     Pending   0          2m16s
  test-cluster-1   0/1     Pending   0          2m16s
  test-cluster-2   0/1     Pending   0          2m16s
  ```

  If the pods are in a `Pending` state, inspect the details of one of the pods to find the root cause:

  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod test-cluster-0 -n tigergraph

  Name:           test-cluster-0

    Warning  FailedScheduling  58s (x4 over 3m8s)  default-scheduler  0/4 nodes are available: 4 pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims.
  ```

  From the events of the pod, you can find out that the root cause is 0/4 nodes are available: 4 pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims , this error indicates that the StorageClass is not existed or the capacity of PV is insufficient.

  Check the storage configuration of the cluster.

  ```bash
  kubectl get tg test-cluster -n tigergraph -o json|jq .spec.storage

  {
    "type": "persistent-claim",
    "volumeClaimTemplate": {
      "accessModes": [
        "ReadWriteOnce"
      ],
      "resources": {
        "requests": {
          "storage": "10G"
        }
      },
      "storageClassName": "test-storage-class",
      "volumeMode": "Filesystem"
    }
  }
  ```

  Check the PVC status of the cluster

  ```bash
  kubectl get pvc -l tigergraph.com/cluster-name=test-cluster -n tigergraph
  ```

  Ensure the STORAGECLASS exists and the capacity of PV is insufficient

  ```bash
  kubectl get STORAGECLASS

  NAME                 PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
  standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd    Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   34m
  standard-csi         pd.csi.storage.gke.io   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true
  ```

  For this test case, the STORAGECLASS test-storage-class does not exist, you should recreate the cluster with a certain STORAGECLASS name in the above list.

  If there are not any pods in the above step, you can check the status of StatefulSet:

  ```bash
  kubectl get statefulset test-cluster -n tigergraph

  NAME           READY   AGE
  test-cluster   3/3     11h
  ```

- ebs csi driver not installed (only on EKS)

  Since some EKS versions do not install aws-ebs-csi-driver plugin by default, if you encounter the following issue when creating TigerGraph cluster with the dynamic persistent volume, you need to check it first.

  After deploying the TigerGraph cluster, all of the TigerGraph pods are in Pending status, and all of the PVC attached to the StatefulSet of TigerGraph are also in Pending status.

  ```bash
  # please replace the cluster name and namespace with yours.
  kubectl get pods -l tigergraph.com/cluster-name=test-cluster --namespace tigergraph

### Check the initialize job of TG Cluster

If you've successfully created the StatefulSet and cluster pods for your TigerGraph cluster but encounter anomalies in the cluster's status, such as liveness and readiness staying unready for an extended period, you can follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue.

- Ensure initialize job has been created

  ```bash
  kubectl get job -l tigergraph.com/cluster-job=test-cluster-init-job -n tigergraph
  ```

- If initialize job is exist and the COMPLETIONS of the job are not 1/1, you need to check the pod status of the job

  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -l job-name=test-cluster-init-job -n tigergraph

  NAME                          READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
  test-cluster-init-job-p9lqr   0/1     Completed   0          12h
  ```

  If the pod status is incomplete, investigate further by checking the logs of the error pod (if it exists) to identify the root cause of the initialization job failure:

  ```bash
  # It equals kubectl logs test-cluster-init-job -n tigergraph
  kubectl logs -l job-name=test-cluster-init-job -n tigergraph

  Defaulted container "cluster-installer" out of: cluster-installer, init-tigergraph (init)

  ```

  Examine the logs for any error messages that might provide insights into the failure. It's essential to address these issues to ensure a successful initialization.

- Check the cluster status by logging into a pod

  If all the previous steps have been completed successfully, you can log into one of the cluster pods to check the detailed errors of the cluster using the `gadmin status -v` command. This can help identify any ongoing issues with the cluster:

  ```bash
  kubectl tg connect --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph

  tigergraph@test-cluster-0:~$ gadmin status

  ```

  The gadmin status command provides detailed information about the status of various TigerGraph services and processes. Review the output to check for any services or processes that are not running correctly.

  If the liveness check of the pod continues to fail, you can use a single command to get the cluster status:

  ```bash
  kubectl exec -it test-cluster-0 -n tigergraph -- /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app/cmd/gadmin status -v

### Conflict port for NodePort Listener type

If you encounter conflicts with port allocation when creating or updating a cluster with `LISTENER_TYPE=NodePort` and specified `nginx-node-port` values that conflict with in-use ports, you will receive an error message. To resolve this issue, specify available ports for these services:

```bash
# Create a cluster with --listener-type NodePort, and there is a tg cluster using the default port 30090, 30240
kubectl tg create --cluster-name tg-cluster-2 --listener-type NodePort --nginx-node-port 30240

# Check the CR, it indicates the provided port is already allocated. 
kubectl describe tigergraph.graphdb.tigergraph.com/tg-cluster-2

### TigerGraph Status is empty and Pods are not created

This issue may happen when:

1. Upgrade operator by `kubectl tg upgrade` command
2. Resize Node Pool to 0 or delete Node Pool in GKE/EKS clusters

When you create a TigerGraph CR, and run `kubectl get tg -n $NAMESPACE`, you will find that the status of the cluster is empty:

```bash
$ kubectl get tg -n tigergraph -w
NAME            REPLICAS   CLUSTER-SIZE   CLUSTER-HA   CLUSTER-VERSION                             SERVICE-TYPE   CONDITION-TYPE   CONDITION-STATUS   AGE
test-cluster                                           docker.io/tginternal/tigergraph-k8s:3.9.3   LoadBalancer                                       1m
```

And when you run `kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE`, no pod has been created for this CR. The possible reason is that the reconcile is not triggered due to an issue of controller-runtime package. The log of operator will be like:

```bash

You can see there are logs output by webhooks, which means webhooks work well. But when webhooks accept creation of TigerGraph CR, the reconcile for TigerGraph CR is not triggered. If you encounter this issue, you can uninstall the running operator by `kubectl tg uninstall --namespace $NAMESPACE`, and install it again. Then the reconcile will be triggered properly.
